      "'The longtime frontman for \\'90s industrial superstars White Zombie, New England-bred multi-hyphenate Rob Zombie went on to forge a highly successful solo career and later branched off into the world of film. A lover of B-movie camp, horror nostalgia, and psychedelic imagery, his enduring 1998 debut Hellbilly Deluxe set him apart from contemporaries by balancing brutal metal power with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor and sexiness that never took itself too seriously. Over the decades, he remained a fixture in the U.S. Top Ten, scoring additional hits with 2001\\'s The Sinister Urge and 2006\\'s Educated Horses. As his film career took off, he released cult favorites such as 2003\\'s House of 1000 Corpses, 2005\\'s The Devil\\'s Rejects, and a pair of big-budget reboots for the Halloween series. In 2021, he issued his seventh set, The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy, and in 2022 he appeared on the soundtrack for the film The Munsters, which he also wrote and directed. Born Robert Bartleh Cummings on January 12, 1966, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, his eclectic style was solidified early on: not only was he raised by parents who had worked in a carnival, but he was fascinated with horror movies from a young age. In addition to fostering his creative abilities in art school, he worked as a bike messenger, porn magazine art director, and production assistant for the classic children\\'s TV series Pee Wee\\'s Playhouse. Around this time, he founded the band White Zombie with bassist Sean Yseult. They remained an underground act for much of the late \\'80s through a series of cult-favorite indie releases. It wasn\\'t until the success of their 1992 major-label debut, La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1, that Zombie was launched to new prominence within the music industry, allowing him to try his hand at animation (most notably a hallucinatory sequence of the feature film Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America) and directing (he was slated to helm a third chapter of The Crow franchise, working from his own screenplay, but the studio eventually pulled out of the deal). In 1998, three years after the release of White Zombie\\'s final studio album Astro-Creep: 2000, Zombie made his solo debut with the album Hellbilly Deluxe. When it sold more copies in its first week of release than any White Zombie record before it, he disbanded the group to move on as a full-time solo act, quickly issuing Hellbilly remix album American Made Music to Strip By in the fall of 1999. Starting his own label, Zombie-a-Go-Go Records, he gave bands like the Ghastly Ones a home while creating demented mix CDs like Halloween Hootenanny. He delivered remixes to a number of soundtracks while recording a new song for the Mission Impossible: 2 soundtrack, and rounded out his first major solo run with a Rob Zombie toy produced by Todd McFarlane. He began to work on a feature film in April of 2000, funded by Universal Studios after he designed a horror display for their amusement parks. The film, House of 1000 Corpses, was produced and edited, but the studio backed out due to its own corporate standards. Zombie wrangled the rights to the film from the studio while taking out his frustrations on his next solo record, The Sinister Urge. Again working with collaborator Scott Humphrey (who had produced his first record), he drafted in a metal superstar cast including Ozzy Osbourne, Slayer guitarist Kerry King, Mötley Crüe/Methods of Mayhem drummer Tommy Lee, and Limp Bizkit\\'s DJ Lethal. The record was another success, leading to a huge Christmas tour with Osbourne at the end of 2001 and another solo tour in the spring of 2002. Zombie sold House of 1000 Corpses to MGM for a Halloween release, although offers from several smaller studios had to be refused because of the financial loss he would have taken. The film was a cult hit, prompting Zombie to begin work on his next piece of celluloid, 2005\\'s Devil\\'s Rejects. He returned to the recording studio in 2006 for Educated Horses, which veered down a more experimental path that included blues guitar, acoustic tracks, and even a sitar. Despite debuting in the Top Ten of the Billboard album charts and receiving a Grammy nomination for \"The Lords of Salem,\" it was his first album not to receive certification from the RIAA. A pair of best-of collections -- including hits from both White Zombie and his solo discography -- were released that year.After a stint as director and co-writer of the 2007 remake of Halloween, Zombie Live, his first live album, was released in October 2007, the same month that he began an arena tour with Ozzy Osbourne. The release of his next studio album was pushed back due to Zombie\\'s involvement with Halloween II and in 2010, Zombie released Hellbilly Deluxe 2, his first solo album written with the help of his band (which featured John 5 and Piggy D.). Intended as a sequel to his breakout solo debut, it was supported by Zombie\\'s first world tour in a decade. Another remix album, Mondo Sex Head, arrived in 2012 and included reworkings from his back catalog by producers like Photek and the Bloody Beetroots. In early 2013, Zombie returned with his fifth studio album, Venomous Rat Regeneration Vendor, which would be Zombie\\'s lowest-selling album to date, despite its Top Ten Billboard debut. Months later, his film The Lords of Salem was released in theaters, accompanied by a soundtrack featuring songs by Zombie, Rush, and the Velvet Underground. In the years that followed, he returned his focus to his horror empire, creating the Great American Nightmare haunted house attraction, which incorporated characters from his cult films. He also began work on another movie, the crowd-funded killer clown flick 31 (which premiered at Sundance in 2016). He also released his first concert film, The Zombie Horror Picture Show, in 2014, followed by his second live album, Spookshow International Live, in 2015.Zombie\\'s sixth studio LP, The Electric Warlock Acid Witch Satanic Orgy Celebration Dispenser, was released in April 2016. Featuring an abrasive, industrial edge that hadn\\'t been heard since Sinister Urge, Electric Warlock was produced by Zeuss and recorded at Goathouse Studios by Zombie and his band, which included former Marilyn Manson bandmates John 5 and Ginger Fish, as well as bassist Piggy D. That year, he also released the film 31 and recorded his band\\'s set from Riot Fest for Astro Creep: 2000 Live, which arrived in 2018. Months later, he reunited with Marilyn Manson for a joint headlining summer tour, which was kicked off by their collaborative cover of \"Helter Skelter.\" Zombie closed the decade with the final installment of his Firefly family film trilogy, 3 from Hell, which was released in late 2019.On Halloween weekend 2020, the next album era was launched with \"The Triumph of King Freak (A Crypt of Preservation and Superstition),\" the Grammy-nominated single from 2021\\'s The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy. Issued in March, the album became Zombie\\'s seventh consecutive Top Ten on the Billboard 200. In 2022, he produced, wrote, and directed the horror comedy film The Munsters and appeared on the soundtrack. ~ Neil Z. Yeung &amp; Jason Ankeny, Rovi'\n",

      "'Controversial rock frontman Marilyn Manson became a mainstream antihero in the 1990s -- much to the chagrin of conservative politicians, religious leaders, and concerned parents -- ruffling feathers and shocking the masses with his dark brand of glam-influenced industrial metal, outspoken social commentary, and incendiary live shows. The self-proclaimed \"Antichrist Superstar,\" he peddled a disquieting vision of society that focused on sex, drugs, violence, politics, and organized religion, which pushed many of his singles -- including \"The Dope Show,\" \"The Beautiful People,\" and a cover of Eurythmics\\' \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" -- into the upper reaches of the modern rock charts during the late \\'90s and early 2000s. During his band\\'s commercial peak, the conceptual triptych of Antichrist Superstar, Mechanical Animals, and Holy Wood won him a legion of die-hard fans while also attracting media attention and cultural notoriety. Following 2003\\'s The Golden Age of Grotesque, Manson entered his next era with a trio of releases that marked a downturn in mainstream popularity and sales. However, at the turn of the following decade, he staged a surprising late-era comeback with a string of critically acclaimed albums: The Pale Emperor (2015), Heaven Upside Down (2017), and We Are Chaos (2020).Born Brian Warner, Manson was raised in Canton, Ohio. At the age of 18, he relocated to Tampa Bay, Florida, where he worked as a music journalist. In 1989, he became friends with guitarist and fellow outsider Scott Mitchell; the two soon decided to form a band, with Mitchell rechristening himself Daisy Berkowitz and Warner adopting the name Marilyn Manson. With the addition of bassist Gidget Gein and keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy, the group -- originally dubbed Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids -- began self-releasing cassettes and playing gigs, their gothic stage shows notable for Manson\\'s elaborate makeup and homemade special effects. Jettisoning their drum machine in favor of Sara Lee Lucas, the band\\'s sound began taking on a harder edge, and by 1992 they were among the most popular and notorious acts in the South Florida underground. In 1993, Nine Inch Nails\\' Trent Reznor came calling, offering both a contract with his Nothing Records label as well as the chance to open for NIN the following spring; Manson accepted both offers, and the group\\'s debut LP, Portrait of an American Family, appeared during the summer of 1994. With new bassist Twiggy Ramirez replacing Gein, the group\\'s notoriety soared. Most infamously, during an appearance in Salt Lake City, Manson ripped apart a copy of the Book of Mormon while on-stage. The Church of Satan\\'s founder, Anton LaVey, also bestowed upon him the title of \"Reverend,\" further stoking conservatives\\' fears. Manson\\'s cult following continued to swell, and the band broke into the mainstream with the release of 1995\\'s Smells Like Children EP, propelled by their enduring hit cover of Eurythmics\\' \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This).\" Berkowitz quit a short time later and was replaced by guitarist Zim Zum, and the revised group saw their next LP, 1996\\'s conceptual opus Antichrist Superstar, debut at the number three spot on the pop album charts and sell nearly two million copies in the U.S. alone. Produced by Trent Reznor, the multi-platinum Antichrist Superstar became the band\\'s most influential and defining statement. As Manson\\'s popularity grew, so did the furor surrounding him. His concerts were regularly picketed by civic groups, and his music was the subject of widespread attacks from right-wing and religious fronts.Manson continued to court controversy in 1998 with the glam-inspired Mechanical Animals, which included cover art depicting the singer as a naked androgynous alien. The album became the band\\'s first to top the charts and spawned the singles \"The Dope Show\" and \"I Don\\'t Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me).\" While the resulting tour yielded a live album, Last Tour on Earth, the trek was cut short in early 1999 after the band was erroneously blamed for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre. Out of respect for the public, the band retreated from the spotlight and returned to the studio.The third and final part of a thematic album triptych, Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) arrived at the end of 2000, just barely missing the Top Ten. One of Manson\\'s most sprawling conceptual pieces, the politically charged Holy Wood included the singles \"Disposable Teens\" and \"The Fight Song.\" The band returned to the road and toured to support the album during much of 2001. That December, Manson\\'s version of \"Tainted Love\" appeared on the Not Another Teen Movie soundtrack, becoming an unexpected European chart hit.Freed from the mythology of his prior trio of albums, Manson found inspiration for his fifth effort in the sounds of burlesque, cabaret, and the excess of Weimar-era Germany. Longtime bassist Twiggy Ramirez amicably left the group before recording and his spot was filled by Tim Skold (ex-KMFDM). The result was 2003\\'s The Golden Age of Grotesque, which spent a week atop the album charts and ended up on several critics\\' year-end Top Ten lists. The singles \"This Is the New Shit\" and \"Mobscene\" also became live staples for years to come, debuted on the accompanying Grotesk Burlesk tour. As the Grotesque period drew to a close, so too did the stints of longtime members Madonna Wayne Gacy and John 5, who left the group between album releases. The following year, another symbolic end to the era arrived in the form of a greatest-hits affair titled Lest We Forget. The collection covered the band\\'s career highlights -- from Portrait\\'s first single \"Get Your Gunn\" to a 2004 cover version of Depeche Mode\\'s \"Personal Jesus\" -- and earned gold status in multiple countries. At this point, Manson began to branch out from music, displaying his watercolor paintings at art exhibitions, dabbling in filmmaking, and producing his own absinthe.With the curtains closed on his peak mainstream period, Manson\\'s output also took an inward turn, thematically shifting from the grandiose concepts of his peak mainstream period to more personal statements. This next stage began with 2007\\'s Eat Me, Drink Me. Debuting a darker emotional perspective and an increase in singing, the record was written, performed, and produced entirely by Manson and Skold. Landing in the Billboard 200\\'s Top Ten, the set included the singles \"Heart-Shaped Glasses\" and \"Putting Holes in Happiness.\" Skold parted with Manson shortly thereafter and was replaced by returning member and right-hand man Twiggy Ramirez. Manson and Ramirez then began writing material for the band\\'s seventh studio album, The High End of Low, which arrived in spring 2009 and reached number four on the charts. In 2011, during preparation for the release of the band\\'s eighth studio album, longtime drummer Ginger Fish announced he had left the group. On his own, Manson forged ahead, premiering Born Villain, a short film directed by Shia La Beouf that served as support for his forthcoming album of the same name. One of his lowest-performing albums to date, Born Villain featured the track \"No Reflection,\" which managed to become his highest-charting single in almost a decade.Despite the creative musical slump, Manson remained busy with other exploits, furthering his acting career with film and television roles, including a fortuitous appearance on the show Californication, where he met score composer Tyler Bates (Guardians of the Galaxy, John Wick, 300). The pair hit it off and began recording what would become Manson\\'s big comeback. His ninth album overall, The Pale Emperor was released in January 2015 on Loma Vista in the U.S. and Cooking Vinyl internationally. Favored by critics as one of the band\\'s best late-era efforts, the blues rock-inspired album peaked in the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 and topped the Hard Rock chart. Capitalizing on the creative momentum, Manson and Bates extended their partnership in 2017 with another collaboration. Originally titled Say10, Heaven Upside Down -- Manson\\'s tenth album -- featured the singles \"We Know Where You F*cking Live\" and \"Kill4Me.\" The set placed Manson back on the pop Top Ten and was supported by extensive touring, including a summer jaunt that reunited Manson with fellow shock-rock veteran Rob Zombie. At the start of their joint tour, Manson issued a cover of the song \"Cry Little Sister\" and a duet with Zombie covering the Beatles\\' \"Helter Skelter.\" More cover singles arrived in 2019, namely \"God\\'s Gonna Cut You Down\" and \"The End\" by the Doors.The 2020s were ushered in by Manson\\'s 11th full-length, We Are Chaos, which was produced by outlaw country musician Shooter Jennings. Released that September, the set yielded the singles \"Don\\'t Chase the Dead\" and the title track. Months later, in January 2021, multiple allegations of abuse against Manson were made public. Subsequently, he was dropped by Loma Vista, his talent agency, and his manager of 25 years. He was also removed from scheduled appearances on television shows American Gods and Creepshow. ~ Neil Z.

      "\"One can't overstate the size of the Fear Factory boot print on the neck of heavy metal. Unleashing influential albums with devastating anthems for over 30 years, Fear Factory is widely recognized as both crucial and innovative in extreme metal circles. Fear Factory manufactured, demanufactured, and remanufactured a sound that reverberates across several subgenres. They perfected an explosive blend of staccato paint-stripping riffs, industrial-tinged drums, electronic flourishes, and a scream/sing dichotomy, all of which became staples in heavy music, ever since the group first emerged in L.A.Fear Factory records are cinematic in scope; sonic landscapes, echoing the dystopian post-apocalyptic futures found in classic sci-fi literature and films, from Ray Bradbury to Blade Runner. Aggression Continuum, the tenth studio album, is the culmination of three decades of unforgettable songs, performances, and forward-thinking storytelling concepts, while simultaneously rebooting Fear Factory onto a brilliant and excitingly unpredictable new path.Aggression Continuum boasts the definitive attack of songs like “Recode,” “Distruptor,” and “Purity.” The riffs, concepts, and passion remain strong, as Fear Factory celebrates its past, present, and future. Whatever may come, Fear Factory will be there, a soundtrack to humankind's uncertain times ahead.\"\n",

      "\"Rammstein are one of rock's most individual and successful names, a multiple award-winning outfit with a vision that continues to evolve. Since forming in 1994, the six East Berliners have headlined the world's major festivals and stadiums, selling millions of albums, and topping charts worldwide.For the Rammstein kollektiv, and it's the same line-up now as at the start, it's always been a case of marching to their own beat; they sing in German, side-step those visuals typical of the metal world, and present an incendiary live experience that touches all of the senses – an experience underpinned by cultural and artistic weight.To date, there are seven studio albums under the Rammstein banner, the most recent being 2019's untitled release – a body of work that headed the charts in 14 countries and went Top 10 in the US, breaking new ground. Produced by the band with Olsen Involtini, this 11-tracker (double platinum in Germany) was preceded by lead single ‘Deutschland', a domestic No. 1 supported by a nine-minute movie – an epic, unflinching look at German history directed by Specter Berlin.Not only was this album a decade in the making, it also saw the musicians taking their legendary live show into Stadiums, selling 800,000 tickets immediately and eventually playing to over 1.2 million fans across 17 countries.The next leg of the European Stadium Tour takes place in spring / summer 2021, with most venues sold out.

      "'American hard rock outfit Filter crushes caustic, head-rattling aggression into a melodic, electronic-leaning industrial package, bridging the worlds of alternative and metal. Emerging as one of the most popular bands in the mid-\\'90s post-industrial alternative scene, they evolved from a Nine Inch Nails offshoot into a fully realized entity under the guidance of primary creative force Richard Patrick, who was a part of NIN in their early days. Breaking into the mainstream with their 1995 debut Short Bus, Filter made their contribution to the era with the enduring single \"Hey Man, Nice Shot\" before expanding their creative scope and incorporating fresh elements for their highest-charting effort to date, Title of Record. That album also spawned their highest-charting single with the surprisingly vulnerable ballad \"Take a Picture,\" which peaked just shy of the Top Ten on the Hot 100. 2002\\'s The Amalgamut kept them firmly entrenched as rock radio favorites, but as the landscape shifted into the 2010s, fluctuating chart performance and sales created a lull, with 2013\\'s The Sun Comes Out Tonight briefly pulling Filter to their best showing on the Billboard 200 in over a decade. At the close of the 2010s, Patrick celebrated Filter\\'s \\'90s peak with deluxe reissues of their first two efforts. Material from sessions intended as a follow-up to one of those albums, Short Bus, would wind up on their eighth album, 2023\\'s The Algorithm.Filter came to life in the early \\'90s, created by vocalist and primary member Richard Patrick, who had been a guitarist with Nine Inch Nails during that band\\'s Pretty Hate Machine and Broken eras. In 1993, Patrick decided to leave NIN to form his own band. He met Brian Liesegang through a mutual friend and the pair began to record together. Patrick handled vocals, guitars, bass, programming, and drums, while Liesegang covered programming, guitars, keyboards, and drums. Since they had both experimented with electronics early in their careers, the band\\'s initial sound was reminiscent of a more-muscular brand of industrial than NIN. In 1995, after signing with Reprise, they released their debut full-length, Short Bus, which was recorded at a small house on the outskirts of Cleveland. The album became a surprise hit and -- thanks to the MTV and alternative radio hit \"Hey Man, Nice Shot\" -- was certified gold by the summer. Eventually, Short Bus went platinum. In order to promote the record, the duo recruited guitarist Geno Lenardo, bassist Frank Cavanaugh, and drummer Matt Walker and embarked on tour. To keep interest stoked, Filter also contributed a prolific string of tracks to cult favorite soundtracks, delivering \"Jurassitol\" (The Crow: City of Angels), the Crystal Method collaboration \"(Can\\'t You) Trip Like I Do\" (Spawn), and \"Thanks Bro\" and \"One\" for a pair of X-Files compilations. Despite the band\\'s burgeoning status, Liesegang departed in 1997 over creative differences. Patrick retained the Filter name for 1999\\'s sophomore release Title of Record, which was also certified platinum and spawned an even bigger mainstream hit with the crossover Top 20 single \"Take a Picture.\"Filter\\'s third album, The Amalgamut, followed three years later, after which the band went on a short hiatus while Patrick entered rehabilitation for addiction. Around 2005, he announced the formation of a new band, Army of Anyone, which he created with former members of Stone Temple Pilots and David Lee Roth\\'s touring band. However, Patrick did not abandon his original group, and Filter returned in 2008 with the emotional Anthems for the Damned, dedicated to a friend who was killed in Iraq. The band\\'s first greatest-hits compilation, The Very Best Things (1995-2008), followed in 2009.Filter\\'s fifth set, 2010\\'s The Trouble with Angels, marked an unapologetic return to the sound of Short Bus. The Trouble with Angels performed well enough -- it debuted at 64 on the Billboard 200, reaching number seven on the Top Hard Rock Albums chart -- to attract the attention of the hard rock label Wind-Up, which released the band\\'s next album, the Bob Marlette-produced The Sun Comes Out Tonight, in June 2013. The album incorporated an updated sound, adding some harmonies and electronic elements close to musical progeny Linkin Park. Sun Comes Out was also their highest-charting album since 2002. While recording a follow-up, Patrick\\'s supporting band changed again and he was joined by Oumi Kapila (guitar, programming), Ashley Dzerigian (bass), Chris Reeve (drums), and Bobby Miller (keyboards). In January 2016, Filter returned with the single \"Take Me to Heaven,\" which was included on their seventh LP, Crazy Eyes. While charting modestly on the Billboard 200, the album performed well on the U.S. Alternative and Hard Rock charts.In 2018, over two decades after Filter\\'s breakthrough, Patrick reconnected with Liesegang to craft a sequel to Short Bus, which they referred to as \"ReBus.\" Various setbacks eventually forced Patrick to take another approach, but to celebrate their debut all the same, an expanded edition of Short Bus was released with a handful of remixes. The following year, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Title of Record, Patrick also reissued the album, bundling it with the fan-favorite soundtrack contributions from that era. A smattering of material from those 2018 Short Bus sequel sessions were eventually revived for The Algorithm, the band\\'s eighth set. Released in August 2023, the LP featured singles \"For the Beaten\" and Obliteration.\" ~ Neil Z. Yeung'\n",

      "'American metal crew Static-X emerged at the tail end of the \\'90s, pushing an aggressive thrash metal blend with industrial overtones and a techno pulse. Their breakthrough debut, 1998\\'s cult classic Wisconsin Death Trip, rocketed them to stardom in the heavy music world, their image boosted by frontman Wayne Static\\'s distinctive hair and vocal delivery. While maintaining momentum into the 2000s with additional efforts like Machine and Shadow Zone, Static\\'s passing in 2014 effectively halted the group in their tracks. However, at the close of the decade, the original lineup made a comeback with the help of previously recorded Static vocals, issuing Project Regeneration in 2020.Static-X\\'s roots trace to the Midwest, where vocalist/guitarist Wayne Static grew up in Michigan and drummer Ken Jay in Illinois. They ended up in Chicago separately and met at the record store where Jay worked, introduced to one another by future Smashing Pumpkins vocalist Billy Corgan (who was in the band Deep Blue Dream with Static). Static and Jay decided to head west to California and start up a new band. Shortly after their arrival, Osaka native Koichi Fukada responded to the duo\\'s ad and became their new guitarist, as well as programmer. Bassist Tony Campos, the only true Californian, was the final piece of the puzzle. Signed to Warner Brothers in February 1998, Static-X debuted with Wisconsin Death Trip a year later. The album was a hit and eventually certified platinum, bolstered by the strength of the singles \"Push It\" and \"Bled for Days.\" Despite the success, founding guitarist Fukada briefly left the group in 2000, replaced by Tripp Eisen (ex-Dope) for 2001\\'s gold-certified Machine, their highest-charting effort to date. Further lineup changes followed, as drummer Jay left after the 2003 album Shadow Zone. Soon after, misdemeanor charges forced Eisen to leave the band in 2004 (he was later convicted and spent a year in prison). Still, Static-X was undeterred. Static tapped Fukada to rejoin on guitar and programming in 2005, while touring drummer Nick Oshiro took over full-time.In June 2005, a rejuvenated Static-X returned to recording with Start a War, home to the single \"I\\'m the One.\" Fifth album Cannibal arrived in 2007, charting inside Billboard\\'s Top 40. The band toured and released a CD/DVD document, Cannibal Killers Live, then settled into the recording of their sixth studio album, Cult of Static. Released in March 2009, it debuted inside the Top 20, their second highest showing to date. The group went on hiatus not long after finishing a lengthy tour, with Wayne Static announcing a renewed focus on his Pighammer side project, with contributions from his wife, Tera Wray. In 2011, Pighammer appeared as a solo album under his own name. A year later, he re-formed Static-X -- minus any of the original members. The lineup, which consisted of his solo backing band, mounted a tour but broke up by 2013, and a year later, Wayne Static was dead of a drug overdose at the age of 48. Just over a year after that, his widow Tera Wray took her own life.This tragedy seemed to spell the end of Static-X, but a few years later, the remaining bandmembers patched up their differences and decided to see if they could salvage anything from past recordings. Starting from a slew of unreleased demos, the group went into the studio, once again with Ulrich Wild, where they stripped Wayne\\'s vocals from the demos and composed entirely new tunes around them. The resultant album, Project Regeneration, was released in two volumes, with Vol. 1 arriving in the summer of 2020. To support the release, the band embarked on tour with a new, masked frontman named Xer0, rumored to be Edsel Dope of Dope. Lead single \"Hollow\" crashed the U.S. Dance/Electronic chart, peaking in the Top 15. ~ Neil Z. Yeung &amp; Josh Loehr, Rovi'\n",

      "\"One of the best-selling rock bands of the 21st century, two-time GRAMMY Award-nominated multiplatinum Wisconsin quartet Skillet—John Cooper [lead vocals/bass], Korey Cooper [guitar/keys], Jen Ledger [drums/vocals], and Seth Morrison [lead guitar]—write the soundtrack to triumph. An undying spirit humbly asserted and affirmed the band as one of this generation's most successful rock acts. However, as all classic underdog stories do, it happened quietly under the radar. By 2019, they not only garnered a pair of GRAMMY Award nods and sold over 12 million albums worldwide, but they also took home a Billboard Music Award for the double-platinum Awake. Its breakout single “Monster” remains “one of the most-streamed rock songs of all-time” with 285 million global audio streams. 2016's Unleashed bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200. Going #1 on Rock Radio, the lead single “Feel Invincible” cracked 150 million global audio streams and went platinum. Meanwhile, the gold-certified Unleashed became their fourth consecutive album to receive either a gold, platinum, or double-platinum plaque. To date, nine original tunes earned RIAA recognition in tandem with high-profile syncs by everyone from WWE and Marvel to ESPN and NFL. Between selling out arenas on four continents, the group performed on CONAN and graced the pages of USA Today and New York Times, to name a few. In 2018 alone, the band clocked 1 billion streams. This momentum continues on their 2019 tenth full-length, Victorious.\"\n",

      "'Pulling the harsh sounds of industrial rock into the mainstream, Trent Reznor and his band Nine Inch Nails became the face of industrial music in the \\'90s with \"Head Like a Hole,\" \"Closer,\" and \"Hurt\" becoming hits and The Downward Spiral (1994) and The Fragile (1999) topping the charts. Nominated for over a dozen Grammys, NIN won Best Metal Performance awards in 1992 and 1996 for two tracks -- \"Wish\" and \"Happiness in Slavery\" -- from their metallic EP Broken. Extending into the 2000s, Reznor maintained his chart success, even as the band\\'s style shifted to incorporate atmospheric electronic elements influenced by his Oscar-winning film scores. In 2016, after decades as the only official member of the band, he welcomed English producer Atticus Ross -- his longtime film scoring partner and bandmate in side project How to Destroy Angels -- as NIN\\'s official second member. Over the next five years, the duo enjoyed a prolific period that saw additional new film scores as well as NIN projects like 2018\\'s Bad Witch LP and a continuation of their ongoing instrumental Ghost series which saw two new entries in 2020\\'s Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts.Michael Trent Reznor was born May 17, 1965, in New Castle, Pennsylvania and raised in Mercer, a small town outside Pittsburgh. His parents divorced when he was six and he was raised by his maternal grandparents. As a child, Reznor had already developed a keen interest in music. He learned to play piano, tenor sax, and tuba, playing in his school\\'s jazz and marching bands while also acting in high-school productions of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Music Man. Outside of the classical sphere, his biggest rock influence was Kiss, whose theatricality and live shows would later inform NIN\\'s acclaimed stage production. While studying music and computer engineering at local Allegheny College, he was a fleeting member of new wave outfit Option 30, contributing vocals and keyboards before parting ways with the band when he dropped out of school to pursue music full-time. He packed up and moved to Cleveland, Ohio with his friend Chris Vrenna, who later became a founding member of the first incarnation of NIN.While in Cleveland, Reznor was drawn to new wave and the industrial sounds of Ministry and Skinny Puppy. He gigged around town for a few years, playing in cover band the Urge before joining the Innocent as their keyboardist. The latter band released a single full-length, 1985\\'s Livin\\' in the Street (Red Label Records), before Reznor quit. He soon hooked up with synth pop group Exotic Birds, contributing keys, programming, and backing vocals, while also recruiting Vrenna on drums. Despite their brief run together, Reznor appeared with the band in the 1987 Michael J. Fox/Joan Jett film Light of Day as a fictional band dubbed The Problems. His final roles in the local keyboardist circuit were with pop outfit Slam Bamboo -- they issued a single \"White Lies\"/\"Cry Like a Baby\" in 1988 -- and new wavers Lucky Pierre, whose vocalist Kevin McMahon would later form Prick, one of the first signees to Reznor\\'s future record label, Nothing Records.During these stints, Reznor continued to work on his own material while employed as an assistant engineer and handyman at Cleveland\\'s Right Track studio. When the shop closed for the day, owner Bart Koster allowed Reznor to use the facilities for free. The seeds from these early recording sessions -- on which he played keyboards, drums, guitars, and samplers himself -- would grow into Nine Inch Nails\\' first demo, Purest Feeling. After making NIN\\'s live debut as tour openers for Skinny Puppy, Reznor shopped the demo tape around the U.S., landing a deal with indie label TVT Records. Reznor quickly returned to the studio to polish existing Purest Feeling tracks and record some new songs. The result, 1989\\'s Pretty Hate Machine, presented a dark, synth-soaked vision of industrial that was also hook-heavy and accessible. Combined with a lyrical focus on sex, self-loathing, betrayal, angst, and religion, these attributes would become hallmarks of Reznor\\'s early-era material. Pretty Hate Machine only peaked at number 75 on the Billboard 200, but a burgeoning cult following helped maintain its chart presence and sales. Buoyed by radio and MTV airplay for singles \"Down in It\" and \"Head Like a Hole,\" it became the first independent release to receive platinum certification to date.Promotion of Pretty Hate Machine kept the band (then primarily composed of Reznor, Richard Patrick, Chris Vrenna, and various drummers/keyboardists) on the road for years, spreading NIN\\'s fan base across genre lines by not only opening for Skinny Puppy, but also alternative/goth acts the Jesus and Mary Chain and Peter Murphy of Bauhaus. Their American reach expanded in 1991 when they joined inaugural Lollapalooza tour, playing alongside Siouxsie and the Banshees, Living Colour, Violent Femmes, Rollins Band, Lords of Acid, Jane\\'s Addiction, and more. Days after the conclusion of Lollapalooza, NIN shipped off to Europe, opening a pair of shows for Guns N\\' Roses and penetrating the German industrial market.When NIN returned to the U.S., Reznor became embroiled in a lengthy legal feud with TVT, which was eager to pump out another, similar-sounding hit album, constricting his creativity in the process. In secret, he signed a new deal with Interscope Records and created the vanity label Nothing Records. The band relocated to a new studio in Los Angeles and began recording a batch of aggressive songs inspired by punk and metal. With production by Flood and drumming by Martin Atkins and Vrenna, the Broken EP landed in September 1992, peaking inside the Top Ten on the Billboard 200. In addition to the Grammy-winning single \"Wish,\" the effort also included covers of Adam and the Ants\\' \"(You\\'re So) Physical\" and Reznor\\'s collaboration with Pigface, \"Suck.\" Reznor enhanced his reputation as a provocateur with a widely banned music video for \"Happiness in Slavery,\" which depicted S&amp;M performance artist Bob Flanagan being torn apart by a machine. There was also a near-mythical, long-form clip for Broken that was never officially released commercially due to its graphic content (a torture victim is dismembered while viewing NIN videos). Bootleg versions became a prized fan commodity and a remastered version found its way onto the Internet in 2006. The Broken era came to a close with NIN\\'s first remix EP, Fixed.Still based in the Los Angeles studio dubbed Le Pig -- coincidentally built in the same house where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by Charles Manson\\'s followers in 1969 -- Reznor began work on the highly anticipated follow-up to Pretty Hate Machine. A concept album centered on the protagonist\\'s titular descent into self-destruction, The Downward Spiral arrived in March 1994 and debuted at number two. Widely considered to be Reznor\\'s masterwork, The Downward Spiral is often cited as one of the most important albums of the \\'90s, presenting a bleak, nihilistic version of NIN that would nonetheless break the band into the mainstream. Hit single \"Closer\" was a staple on both MTV and radio, despite its graphic music video and lyrical content, while \"Hurt\" became a live fixture for NIN, receiving a second life in 2003 through Johnny Cash\\'s stripped-down cover version.The Downward Spiral was anything but for the band, launching them further into the public consciousness and prompting an industry push for soundalikes Gravity Kills, Stabbing Westward, and Filter on rock radio. NIN promoted the effort with the Self Destruct Tour, which featured Vrenna on drums, James Woolley on keyboards, Robin Finck on guitar, and Danny Lohner on bass. Already a formidable concert presence, NIN\\'s reputation grew with chaotic performances that often ended in destroyed equipment and serious injuries. That intense commitment to their live show reached into American living rooms in the summer of 1994 with their show-stealing, mud-covered set from Woodstock \\'94, which won them another Grammy for the live recording of \"Happiness in Slavery.\" After the release of the remix album Further Down the Spiral, NIN continued to tour, supported by then-newcomers Marilyn Manson, before joining major influence David Bowie on the co-headlining Dissonance Tour.During this period, Reznor took his first step into the world of film, assembling the soundtrack to Oliver Stone\\'s controversial movie Natural Born Killers, which included the previously unreleased NIN song \"Burn,\" as well as edits of \"Something I Can Never Have\" and \"A Warm Place.\" Another track, a cover of Joy Division\\'s \"Dead Souls,\" was featured on the soundtrack for The Crow. Reznor also contributed vocals to Tori Amos\\' \"Past the Mission\" from her album Under the Pink.After the conclusion of the Spiral era, NIN entered a period of hibernation. Although Reznor remained active -- producing Marilyn Manson\\'s breakthrough sophomore effort, Antichrist Superstar, and contributing the NIN single \"The Perfect Drug\" to the Reznor-produced soundtrack to David Lynch\\'s Lost Highway -- a growing case of writer\\'s block, struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, and public pressure put a hold on album number three. Encamped at the newly constructed Nothing Studios in New Orleans, a reclusive Reznor spent five years crafting that follow-up, which arrived in 1999.Influenced by the passing of Reznor\\'s maternal grandmother, the deterioration of his friendship with Manson, and his increasing addictions, the conceptual double-disc opus The Fragile debuted at the top of the charts and was certified double platinum within months. Meticulously produced by Reznor and Alan Moulder, the album included singles \"We\\'re in This Together,\" \"The Day the World Went Away,\" \"Into the Void,\" and \"Starfuckers, Inc.\" The remix LP Things Falling Apart featured interpretations of Fragile tracks, as well as the unreleased \"10 Miles High\" and Gary Numan cover \"Cars.\" On the supporting Fragility tour, the NIN lineup featured Reznor, Finck, and Lohner, as well as newcomers Charlie Clouser on keyboards and Jerome Dillon on drums. That trek spawned a tour documentary titled And All That Could Have Been, which was accompanied by a live recording and limited-edition EP, Still, which featured stripped-down versions of NIN deep cuts, as well as previously unreleased recordings from the era.Toward the end of the Fragile years, Reznor entered rehab after an unexpected overdose in London, putting NIN on hold until they returned in 2005. Sober and refocused, Reznor inaugurated this new chapter with an equally hungry release, fourth LP With Teeth.Unlike prior albums, With Teeth traded gloom, frustration, and pain for outward aggression, matured emotions, and Reznor\\'s first attempts at sociopolitical commentary, also marking a turning point for NIN that informed the vocal delivery, production, and collaborative spirit of the band into the next decade. In addition to production by Reznor and Moulder, the taut set featured programming by Atticus Ross and live percussion by Dave Grohl. In addition to being the band\\'s second straight number one, With Teeth also included a trio of chart-topping singles: \"The Hand That Feeds,\" \"Only,\" and \"Every Day Is Exactly the Same.\" A lengthy tour -- featuring the lineup of Reznor, bassist Jeordie White (aka Marilyn Manson\\'s Twiggy Ramirez), keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, guitarist Aaron North, and drummers Josh Freese/Jerome Dillon -- accompanied the release, documented on 2007\\'s Beside You in Time.While the first decade of NIN\\'s existence was marked by mystery and long periods of silence between major releases, the reinvigorated outfit began churning out material in earnest after With Teeth. In early 2007, a multimedia promotional effort was rolled out to earnest fans who deciphered clues found on T-shirts, websites, and strategically placed USB drives placed hidden throughout Europe. Part of a high-concept alternate reality game, they revealed a fictional story of a future dystopian America and a burgeoning resistance movement, all of which was inspired by George W. Bush\\'s presidency and the post-9/11 Iraq invasion. This overtly political concept was at the core of Year Zero, which arrived in April on Interscope Records. Delving deeper into digital soundscapes, Reznor was once again joined by Ross, who was promoted from assistant to producer (a position he would hold until becoming an official member of NIN a decade later). The promotional tour took the band through Europe, Australia, the U.S., and Asia, notable for featuring NIN\\'s first stop in mainland China at the Beijing Pop Festival that September. While a television show and movie were planned to accompany the Year Zero story, those never came to fruition. The album cycle closed with Year Zero Remixed, which featured reinterpretations by Ladytron, Bill Laswell, the Faint, and rapper Saul Williams, whose third effort, 2007\\'s The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, was produced by Reznor.During this prolific period, NIN also released the four-part ambient instrumental album Ghosts I-IV -- released on Reznor\\'s new label, The Null Corporation -- as well as the surprise album The Slip. Both 2008 efforts were available for free in their digital formats. While The Slip charted outside the Top Ten on the Billboard 200 and the single \"Discipline\" became another rock chart hit, Ghosts was nominated for a pair of Grammy Awards (and the track \"34 Ghosts IV\" would crash the mainstream in an interesting way in 2019). Continuing the direct-to-fans approach, NIN later provided live footage from their accompanying Lights in the Sky tour to online fans, who stitched the pieces together to create a documentary dubbed Another Version of the Truth.The next year, NIN embarked on another trek, the forebodingly dubbed Wave Goodbye tour. When the journey concluded, the band entered an official extended hiatus, during which time Reznor and Ross focused on film scores for director David Fincher (2010\\'s Oscar-winning The Social Network, 2011\\'s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and 2014\\'s Gone Girl). The pair also formed a side project with Reznor\\'s wife, Mariqueen Maandig, called How to Destroy Angels. Essentially NIN with a female vocalist, the outfit released a pair of EPs in 2010 and 2012, as well as a full-length album in 2013. Months after the conclusion of their first tour, NIN returned with their eighth album.The Grammy-nominated Hesitation Marks (Columbia/The Null Corporation) was issued in August 2013. Produced by Reznor, Ross, and Moulder, it debuted at number three on the charts and included the Top Ten single \"Came Back Haunted\" as well as \"Copy of A\" and \"Everything.\" Guest collaborators on the album included Pino Palladino, Lindsey Buckingham, and Adrian Belew. The ensuing Tension arena tour featured backup vocalists Lisa Fischer and Sharlotte Gibson alongside another revamped lineup that included Reznor, Finck, Cortini, Palladino, drummer Ilan Rubin, and guitarist Josh Eustis. NIN extended the Hesitation Marks cycle into 2014 with a co-headlining tour with fellow \\'90s mainstays Soundgarden. That same year, NIN were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.The following year, NIN began the rollout of remastered reissues of past albums. The Fragile appeared in instrumental form exclusively on a streaming platform, with an accompanying collection of instrumental, alternate, and unreleased songs collected as The Fragile: Deviations 1. After the completion of scores for Before the Flood and Patriots Day, Reznor announced a multi-year project that resulted in a NIN EP/short album trilogy, which started with late 2016\\'s Not the Actual Events. A return to the abrasive industrial of the band\\'s earlier days, the five-song set featured the brooding track \"She\\'s Gone Away\" and special guests Mariqueen Maandig, Dave Grohl, and Dave Navarro. Also, after decades of NIN liner notes reading \"Nine Inch Nails is Trent Reznor,\" it was announced that Ross had become a permanent member of the band. In the summer of 2017, the second installment of the series arrived. Add Violence debuted in the Top 20 and spawned the radio hit \"Less Than,\" which climbed the Mainstream Rock and Alternative Songs charts. A year later, the trilogy ended with Bad Witch, which was officially issued as the band\\'s ninth album. Notable for lead single \"God Break Down the Door\" -- featuring jazz saxophone and Reznor singing with a Bowie-esque croon -- Bad Witch also included vocals from the Cult\\'s Ian Astbury and Mariqueen Maandig on \"Shit Mirror.\" In support of the effort, NIN embarked on a 2018 tour dubbed Cold and Black and Infinite, which reunited Reznor with the Jesus and Mary Chain after opening for them almost three decades prior. In 2019, NIN experienced a pop culture resurgence, reaching a fresh audience through some unlikely sources. In addition to a savvy pairing with Captain Marvel -- which saw the titular superhero donning a vintage NIN shirt throughout much of the film -- the band returned to the charts through a clever cover (a pop makeover of \"Head Like a Hole\" called \"On a Roll,\" which was performed by fictional pop star Ashley O, depicted by Miley Cyrus) and a strategic sample (Lil Nas X\\'s use of \"34 Ghosts IV\" in his record-breaking hit single \"Old Town Road\"). To close the year, Reznor and Ross crafted a trio of very NIN-esque scores for the HBO series Watchmen. At the start of the 2020s, as the world was in the grip of a global pandemic, NIN revived their Ghosts series with the sequels Ghosts V: Together and Ghosts VI: Locusts, nearly two-dozen additions to the series inspired by the need for connection in an uncertain time. In 2021, shortly after winning an Oscar for their score to the animated film Soul, Reznor and Ross collaborated with noise band Health on the NIN single \"Isn\\'t Everyone.\" ~ Neil Z. Yeung'\n",

      "'Coal Chamber broke out of the Los Angeles alternative metal scene in 1997 with a sound often compared to Korn, although both bands formed around the same time and are quality representations of the scene\\'s overall sound -- the heavy, detuned guitars of the murkiest Black Sabbath; grungy, noisy textures reminiscent of White Zombie or Tool; the white-knuckle intensity of Pantera and hardcore punk; and perhaps a few hip-hop-influenced beats à la Biohazard. Coal Chamber were formed in 1994 by vocalist/lyricist B. Dez Fafara and guitarist Miguel \"Meegs\" Rascon, who met through a classified ad; the two added drummer Mike \"Mikee\" Cox and bassist Rayna Foss, the latter of whom heard about auditions through her roommate, Fafara\\'s future wife. A huge local buzz following gigs at the Roxy and the Whisky a Go Go, along with a demo tape championed by Fear Factory\\'s Dino Cazares, got the band an opportunity to sign with Roadrunner Records late in 1994, but Fafara suddenly quit due to disagreements with his wife over the band. By the spring of 1995, Fafara changed his mind and returned, a decision that ultimately cost him his marriage, but a renewed sense of energy helped Coal Chamber regain their Roadrunner deal by the end of the year. Their self-titled debut was released in 1997; Chamber Music followed two years later. The album was a minor success but its mixture of goth rock imagery and nu metal thuggery made for an uneven album. They toured heavily behind it but by the time it came time to record the next album, bassist Rayna Foss-Rose was gone to raise her daughter, leaving the band with Nadja Peulen. Nadja took Foss-Rose\\'s place during her pregnancy between the first two albums, but she accepted the invitation to come back as a full-time member during the recording of the next record. The resulting album, Dark Days, was released in the spring of 2002. By May of that same year, the band had begun to fall apart, sparked by an on-stage altercation between Fafara and Rascon. The following year, after issuing a remix and rarities compilation called Giving the Devil His Due, the bandmembers announced that they had officially broken up, with Fafara continuing on with his new band, Devildriver, with whom he would go on to release six studio albums. In 2011 Coal Chamber began hinting at a possible re-formation, and by 2013 they made it official, performing at Download 2013 and hitting the road with Sevendust, Lacuna Coil, and Stolen Babies. Rivals, the band\\'s first studio recording in 13 years, arrived in early 2015 via Napalm Records. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Born in 1981 in Chicago, Ministry has been the lifetime passion project of founder Al Jourgensen, considered to be the pioneer of industrial music. In its early days, Ministry was identifiable by its heavy synth-pop material in line with the new sounds and technology that were being developed in the ‘80s. Ministry's output began with four 12” singles on Wax Trax! Records in 1981 before the first LP With Sympathy in 1983 via Arista Records. As time progressed however, so did Ministry, quickly developing a harsher, and more stylized sound that the band soon became infamous for on seminal albums Twitch (1986), The Land of Rape and Honey (1988), and The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste (1989). With the release of Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and The Way to Suck Eggs (1992), Ministry hit an all time high in the mainstream musical realm and received its first Grammy nomination. In total, Ministry has been nominated for a Grammy award six times. After an indefinite hiatus in 2013, Ministry's 2018 album, AmeriKKKant, continued to reflect Jourgensen's views on the frightening state of society and politics.Ministry's newest album MORAL HYGIENE is set to be released on October 1st, 2021 via Nuclear Blast Records.\"\n",

With each successive release, they polished their corrosive attack, expanding their industrial-metal sound with 2017\\'s sophomore release shutdown.exe. By 2019, they joined the company of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, recruiting famed industrial producer Sean Beavan for Metawar.In 2013, after vocalist Alexis Mincolla and keyboardist/producer Xavier Swafford met at one of Mincolla\\'s underground \"Lil Death\" parties, they got together to form the transgressive artistic collaborative. Along with drummer Andrew Means and guitarist Chase Brawner, they created an all-inclusive experience wherein they self-produced all their music and visuals, including their videos, which served as biting social commentary and tongue-in-cheek propaganda, similar to Rammstein or Tool. Their sound strikes a familiar tone for anyone who is a fan of early-\\'90s Wax Trax or the pop-industrial trinity of Ministry, Skinny Puppy, and Nine Inch Nails. In June 2014, they released their self-titled debut, which was quickly followed by a remix collection in October of the same year. 3Teeth were in the midst of recording a second LP, but fate took them down a different path: after a chance meeting with Adam Jones (Tool) at a wedding -- Mincolla and Jones were both in the groom\\'s party -- the band was invited to open Tool\\'s 2016 tour with Primus, opening 3Teeth up to a much wider audience. After the conclusion of the trek, 3Teeth returned to the studio and unveiled \"Degrade\" -- the first taste of their sophomore effort shutdown.exe, which arrived in May 2017. Following stints opening for Rammstein, Danzig, and H.I.M., the band got to work on their third album, recruiting shutdown.exe mixer Sean Beavan (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson) as producer. Metawar (Century Media) was issued in July 2019, just as the band hit the road with Ministry. The typically caustic set included the singles \"American Landfill\" and \"EXXXIT,\" as well as their subversive take on Foster the People\\'s \"Pumped Up Kicks.\" In April 2021, they released Guns Akimbo, a two-track 7\", in conjunction with the Daniel Radcliffe-starring action film of the same name. The album featured covers of Sweet\\'s \"Ballroom Blitz\" and Dead or Alive\\'s \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record Baby).\" -~ Neil Z. Yeung'\n",

      "'Part of the late-\\'90s mainstream industrial boom, American rock group Stabbing Westward wrapped their dour, angst-filled cries in appropriately dark and moody atmospherics, joining bands like Nine Inch Nails and Gravity Kills with a similarly corrosive style that would evolve into the early 2000s. Breaking into the mainstream with their sophomore LP, 1996\\'s gold-certified Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel, they issued another gold album (1998\\'s Darkest Days) before closing out their first era with the stylistic shift of 2001\\'s fraught, pop-leaning Stabbing Westward. Disbanding in 2002, the group members split and pursued individual projects, most notably the Dreaming. After a nearly two-decade absence from the studio, the band regrouped and issued the comeback Dead and Gone EP at the start of 2020. In 2022, they released their fifth official full-length, Chasing Ghosts.Stabbing Westward was formed in 1985 in Macomb, Illinois by vocalist Christopher Hall and keyboardist Walter Flakus, schoolmates and radio station colleagues at Western Illinois University. They moved east to Chicago in 1986 and recruited guitarist Jim Clanin to solidify the original lineup. The trio released an EP in the early \\'90s titled Iwo Jesus (which was officially reissued in 2020), and added guitarist Stuart Zechman, bassist Jim Sellers, and drummer Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails, Die Warzau) for the recording of a series of demos that eventually caught the attention of Columbia Records. After signing with the label, Vrenna parted ways with the group and was replaced briefly by David Suycott. In late 1993, Columbia issued the band\\'s major-label debut, Ungod. Although album sales were less than desirable, the group promoted it relentlessly, touring with the likes of Depeche Mode and Killing Joke and building a modest fan base. After more personnel changes -- Suycott was replaced by Andy Kubiszewski (Exotic Birds, The The) and Zechman left without a replacement -- the band returned to the studio to record their sophomore effort.Their early groundwork promoting Ungod paid off in 1996, when the group released their breakthrough second album, Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel. Buoyed by the success of singles \"What Do I Have to Do?\" and \"Shame,\" the album reached gold status. As the songs climbed the Billboard rock charts -- both became Top Ten hits on the U.S. Mainstream Rock list -- the music videos also helped push the band\\'s mainstream exposure. Following the success of Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel, Stabbing Westward spent most of 1997 in seclusion, working on their third album in their new home base of Los Angeles. That record, entitled Darkest Days, was released in April 1998. Debuting at number 52 on the Billboard 200, it became their second gold-certified release and yielded the hit single \"Save Yourself.\" Despite the chart success, Columbia parted ways with the band in the spring of 2000.A year later, the band inked a deal with Koch Records and issued a self-titled release. Stabbing Westward featured a distinct stylistic shift that included acoustic guitars and a polished pop sound that presented a fresh way for the band to deliver their pained and anguished messages. Single \"So Far Away\" was a modest hit on the Billboard rock charts, while the album peaked at number two on the Indie Album chart and became their highest-charting to date on the Billboard 200. Plans for a fifth studio effort were in the works in late 2001, but momentum was abruptly halted when Stabbing Westward disbanded in February the next year. In the years that followed, bandmembers pursued their personal projects, with Hall most notably forming the Dreaming. Flakus worked as a radio personality before reuniting with Hall in the Dreaming in 2015. Kubiszewski worked as a producer and songwriter for other artists and also began composing music for television shows. In the early 2010s, the band teased reunions at the Dreaming concerts, but did not officially reunite until 2016 at the Cold Waves Festival in Chicago. In addition to former members Hall, Flakus, Mark Eliopulos, and Johnny Haro, the new lineup also featured Carlton Bost (the Dreaming, Orgy). Another Orgy alum, Bobby Amaro, joined the fray in 2018, replacing Haro for a 2018 tour celebrating Darkest Days\\' 20th anniversary.With nostalgic fan interest at a peak, the band announced its official return in 2019. The quartet -- Hall, Flakus, Bost, and Amaro -- entered the studio to record Stabbing Westward\\'s first output in nearly two decades. The resulting EP, Dead and Gone, arrived at the start of 2020. Later that year, they released a holiday-appropriate EP, Hallowed Hymns, which included their cover of the Cure\\'s Crow soundtrack highlight \"Burn,\" Ministry\\'s \"Everyday Is Halloween,\" and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen\\'s \"The Killing Moon.\" Rollout for their comeback album continued in earnest in 2021 with the release of \"I Am Nothing\" and an EP of the same name. That track, along with \"Ghosts,\" landed on 2022\\'s Chasing Ghosts. Stabbing Westward\\'s fifth full-length, the album was produced by John Fryer and mixed by Tom Baker, both of whom worked with the band on Ungod and Wither Blister Burn &amp; Peel. ~ Neil Z.

      "'Since the release of his debut ‘Gothic Electronic Anthems\\' in 2003, Gothminister Bjørn AlexanderBrem has captured the listeners with his hymns of pitch-black magic. Dark shudders, deep lead vocals and thrilling craft of composing within the marrow of Gothic, Industrial-Metal and Electro have become his trademarks ever since. Driving sequences lead into compelling verses which are soon countered by harsh metalriffs. Finally the listener gets subdued by an overwhelming combination of catchiness, denseness and heavenly choirs.” (Myk Jung)His new album \"Pandemonium\", mixed by Henning Verlage (Unheilig, Eisbrecher), is a long awaited powerhouse which exceeds the even highest expectations. Powerful, sometimes heavily downtuned metal riffs march relentlessly arm in arm with huge orchestras and heavenly choirs.The Master himself reveals an astonishing range of vocal-art: from the deepest Gothic dungeons up to the higher spheres of steaming Rock. The title track of the new album, \"Pandemonium\", takes us back to the new gothic era around 1880 AC, where we find the city and kingdom of Gothministerunder attack from its own inhabitants. The old, mighty and evil king, played by Gothminister himself, faces chaos and uproar among his own.But you should be careful what you wish for.«He who fights monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And ifthou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will gaze into the.» (Friedrich Nietzche) The king is dead. Long live the king!'\n",

      "'Emerging from the European underground in the 1980s, German firebrands KMFDM were part of the industrial wave that crashed the mainstream in the \\'90s alongside kindred spirits Nine Inch Nails, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, and Ministry. With their bold, propaganda-styled album covers and techno-metal anthems, they placed more focus on pulsing dance beats and provocative messages than their darker contemporaries. Counting numerous members over the years, KMFDM\\'s leader has remained frontman and founder Sascha Konietzko, whose multiple roles include songwriter, producer, mixer, programmer, sampler, vocalist, percussionist, bassist, and electronic gadgeteer. The band -- whose initials stand for \"Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit\" and can be translated as \"No Pity for the Majority\" -- swiftly moved past the sinister soundscapes on their 1984 debut Opium to establish their trademark style on 1986\\'s What Do You Know, Deutschland? After an early-\\'90s relocation to the U.S., they became fixtures on the Billboard Dance charts, crashing clubs with hits such as \"Naive,\" \"Split,\" and \"Vogue.\" KMFDM continued to pump out albums for Wax Trax!/TVT until the end of the 20th century, including 1995\\'s top-selling Nihil (home to \"Juke Joint Jezebel\") and 1999\\'s Adios. The latter set was appropriately titled and might have been their final effort, as the group imploded due to internal fighting. However, Konietzko remained with Tim Skold and recruited vocalist Lucia Cifarelli to form offshoot MDFMK during the subsequent hiatus. The trio resurrected KMFDM in 2002, returning with a new label (Metropolis Records) and a reconfigured lineup that boosted Cifarelli to a permanent co-vocalist, kicking off their new era with Attak. Although KMFDM lost Skold and crucial longtime collaborator Raymond Watts (aka PIG) as permanent members, Konietzko, Cifarelli, and a revolving cast of collaborators maintained their streak of thought-provoking and body-moving output until the close of the 2010s with the group\\'s 21st full-length, 2019\\'s Paradise. The 2020s were kicked off with Hyena.Originally formed in Paris, France, KMFDM were founded by Konietzko and German painter/multimedia performer Udo Sturm. The duo made their in-concert debut on February 29, 1984, when they performed at an opening for an exhibition of European artists at the Grand Palais in Paris (with the show consisting of Sturm playing a synthesizer that would play feedback, and Konietzko playing a five-string bass). The same year, KMFDM issued their debut release, Opium, but Sturm exited the group shortly thereafter (around the same time, Konietzko was joined by drummer En Esch, who would remain with the group until 1999). With Sturm out of the picture, Konietzko and Esch put KMFDM on hold at first and joined up with New York industrialist Peter Missing to form the outfit Missing Foundations. But before the new outfit could issue any recordings, both Konietzko and Esch had dropped out and returned to KMFDM (Missing Foundations would carry on with replacement members and go on to issue albums on their own from the late \\'80s through the early \\'90s). KMFDM\\'s sophomore effort, What Do You Know, Deutschland?, arrived in 1986 and was the group\\'s first of many for Chicago\\'s famed industrial label Wax Trax! But instead of if being an album of all new tracks, it was comprised of selections spanning 1983 to 1986 (in fact, several were made prior to Esch\\'s joining). Around this time, KMFDM struck up a relationship with artist Aidan Hughes (aka Brute!), who would steadily supply cover artwork for the group; the images would become synonymous with KMFDM\\'s hard-hitting music. Konietzko and company pushed forward with such further \\'80s releases as 1988\\'s Don\\'t Blow Your Top and 1989\\'s UAIOE, during which KMFDM found themselves in the middle of an underground industrial movement (it didn\\'t hurt matters that Wax Trax! quickly became one of the leading industrial labels in the world, as they were the home to such other similarly styled acts as Ministry, Revco, Front 242, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, and others). However, KMFDM had yet to tour America by 1989 (having heavily toured Europe with the likes of Einstürzende Neubauten, Young Gods, and Borghesia, among others), something they sought to correct when they were offered a slot opening a U.S. tour for labelmates Ministry, who at the time were readying their classic The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste release. With the tour lined up for a summer launch, it was pushed back several times (due to Ministry leader Al Jourgensen falling ill) and the tour finally got underway in December 1989. The trek successfully established KMFDM as a band to watch in the industrial underground, as they returned to Europe after the tour\\'s completion to work on their fifth full-length release overall, 1990\\'s Naïve. Realizing that industrial\\'s future lay in the U.S., Konietzko relocated KMFDM\\'s home base from Hamburg to Chicago in 1991. The same year, KMFDM\\'s side project Excessive Force was formed, issuing a debut release, Conquer Your World, in 1992, the same year that KMFDM issued a new release as well, Money. But just as it appeared as though KMFDM were about to break through to a wider audience, Wax Trax! suddenly found itself on hard times, resulting in the label being bought out by TVT Records. What followed for KMFDM were some of its best-known and strongest releases: 1993\\'s Angst (which earned the group its first real exposure on MTV via the video clip for the track \"Drug Against War\"), 1995\\'s Nihil (home to their biggest hit, \"Juke Joint Jezebel\"), and 1996\\'s XTORT. During the same time, Excessive Force issued a second release, 1994\\'s Gentle Death, while Konietzko relocated once more, this time to Seattle. Further releases followed in the late \\'90s (1997\\'s Symbols, 1998\\'s Agogo, and 1999\\'s Adios), before KMFDM temporarily disbanded on January 22, 1999 due to internal disagreements (longtime members En Esch and Gunter Schulz would permanently part ways with the group).In the wake of the group\\'s split, Konietzko assembled a new outfit, MDFMK (that is, KMFDM spelled backward) and issued a lone self-titled release in 2000 before KMFDM reunited in 2002 for an all-new album, Attak, and the live album Sturm &amp; Drang Tour 2002. Much like their first incarnation, the revamped group continued to issue a reliable and prolific string of efforts throughout the decade. 2003 saw the release of WWIII (their last with Watts until a 2019 collaboration on Paradise), followed by WWIII Live 2003 a year later. Released on KMFDM Records, 2005\\'s Hau Ruck was classic KMFDM in all its aggressive industrial power. The Ruck Zuck EP followed in 2006, with the full-length Tohuvabohu (Hebrew for \"chaos and confusion\") landing in 2007. Remix album Brimborium and rarities collection Extra, Vol. 1 were both released in 2008. Blitz followed in 2009, with the greatest-hits compilation Würst arriving a year later. New material arrived in 2011 with the loud and heavy WTF?! Eighteenth set Kunst followed in 2013, with a song dedicated to the jailed Russian anarchist group Pussy Riot along with a collaboration featuring the Swedish group Morlocks. In 2014, the group celebrated \"Over Two and a Half Decades of Conceptual Continuity\" with a live album, We Are KMFDM, and their 19th studio effort, Our Time Will Come. In 2016, KMFDM signed a contract with Ear Music, releasing a quartet of efforts for the label, including ROCKS: Milestones Reloaded, which featured remixed and updated versions of their hits; the preview EP Yeah!; and Live in the USSA, which was recorded on their tour in support of 20th LP, 2017\\'s Hell Yeah. Returning to Metropolis, KMFDM -- Konietzko, Cifarelli, drummer Andy Selway, and guitarist Andee Blacksugar -- released the intensely political Paradise, which marked a return by Watts on the track \"Binge Boil &amp; Blow,\" their first collaboration since 2003\\'s WWIII. Following the aptly titled 2020 remix album In Dub, the quartet returned with Hyena. Politically charged like its predecessor, the album also dialed back their typical industrial attack, allowing arena-ready metal and thrash, rap verses, and a healthy dose of dub into the mix. ~ Greg Prato &amp; Neil Z.

      "'Drawing from the pioneering work of artists like Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, and Suicide, the dark avant-industrial group Skinny Puppy formed in 1982 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Originally a duo comprised of former Images in Vogue drummer cEvin Key (born Kevin Crompton) and Nivek Ogre (aka Kevin Ogilvie), Skinny Puppy followed their debut cassette, Back and Forth, with the EP Remission, the first of many recordings with producer David \"Rave\" Ogilvie, in 1984.Keyboardist Wilhelm Schroeder joined the group for 1985\\'s full-length debut, Bites, but was replaced the next year by Dwayne Goettel, whose sampling and synth work proved significant in the development of the Skinny Puppy aesthetic from ominous dance music into a distinct fusion of industrial, goth, and electronic sounds. Subsequent releases like 1986\\'s Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse, 1987\\'s Cleanse, Fold and Manipulate, and 1988\\'s VIVIsectVI further honed the trio\\'s style, as well as introducing the outspoken lyrical agenda that remained a thematic constant throughout much of the group\\'s work. In 1989, Ministry\\'s Al Jourgensen added vocals, guitars, and production work to Rabies; later, he joined Ogre in the side project Pigface. Ultimately, the members\\' interest in pursuing similar outside projects began to unravel Skinny Puppy: in 1987, Key and Edward Ka-Spel of the Legendary Pink Dots recorded the album Their Eyes Slowly Burning under the name Tear Garden, and in 1990, he and friend Alan Nelson worked as Hilt. A major rift began splitting the band apart, and Key and Goettel often sided against Ogre, whom they felt was more interested in pursuing solo work than in keeping the trio intact; drugs had also become a serious problem, but Skinny Puppy nonetheless signed to American Recordings in 1993 and relocated to Los Angeles to begin production work.The sessions for the album, titled The Process, proved disastrous; for the first time in nearly a decade, David Ogilvie did not oversee production duties, and the group went through several producers, including former Swan Roli Mosimann and Martin Atkins. Flooding and earthquakes further hampered the sessions, and Key was severely injured in a film shoot. After months of recording, Key and Goettel, dissatisfied with Atkins\\' work, absconded with the master tapes and returned to Vancouver in mid-1994 to finish production. Ogre remained in California, and later announced he was leaving Skinny Puppy to form W.E.L.T. A few months later, on August 23, 1995, Goettel was found dead of a heroin overdose in his parents\\' home; in his honor, Key and Ogilvie finally completed the album, and The Process was released in 1996. A multimedia history of the band, Brap: Back and Forth, Series 3 &amp; 4, followed a few months later, while Key returned to his new project, Download. Released in 1998, Remix Dys Temper featured Skinny Puppy reworkings by Autechre, Neotropic, and Adrian Sherwood in addition to industrial groups like KMFDM and God Lives Underwater. By 2000, the word was out that Key and Ogre had buried the hatchet, reactivated Skinny Puppy, and recording was underway. A 1994 jam between Skinny Puppy and Throbbing Gristle/Psychic TV member Genesis P-Orridge was released under the title Puppy Gristle in 2002 on Key\\'s subCON label. The SPV label (which had long been the distributor of the band\\'s albums in Europe) signed the band in late 2003. Skinny Puppy\\'s Greater Wrong of the Right hit the streets in 2004 with members of Tool, Collide, and Static-X making guest appearances. Two more studio albums, 2007\\'s Mythmaker and 2011\\'s Handover, followed before the release of 2012\\'s live album Bootlegged, Broke and in Solvent Seas. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi'\n",

      "'Heavy and slow, Killing Joke (at least early in their career) were a quasi-metal band dancing to a tune of doom and gloom. They eventually became less heavy and more arty -- more danceable, even -- but they made some urgent slabs of molten dynamite that oozed with the power of thick guitars, thudding drums, and over the top singing. The group\\'s brutal sound emerged from U.K. punk and anticipated industrial, but the pummeling impact of their sound also endeared them to the distaff side of the metal community, and their uncompromising nature allowed them to stand on their own regardless of context. 1980\\'s self-titled debut album was a ferocious statement of purpose, 1985\\'s Night Time opened up their sound, 2003\\'s Killing Joke included longtime fan Dave Grohl sitting in on drums, and 2021\\'s In Dub Rewind (Vol. 1) saw them radically revisiting their past work. The group returned to studio material with 2022\\'s Lord of Chaos EP.The origins of Killing Joke lie in the Matt Stagger Band. Paul Ferguson was drumming for the group when he met Jaz Coleman (vocals, keyboards) in the late \\'70s. Coleman joined the Matt Stagger Band briefly, but soon he and Ferguson split to form Killing Joke in late 1978. The duo recruited bassist Youth (born Martin Glover Youth), who had previously played with the punk group the Rage, and guitarist Geordie (born Kevin Walker) to complete the band\\'s lineup. Killing Joke moved to Notting Hill Gate and recorded their debut EP, Almost Red, with money borrowed from Coleman\\'s girlfriend at the time. BBC disc jockey John Peel was impressed by the EP and offered the group a session on his show, which became one of the most popular shows he broadcast in the late \\'70s. By the end of 1979, the group had signed with Island Records, who allowed them to set up their own label, Malicious Damage.Killing Joke released \"Wardance,\" their debut single on Malicious Damage, in February of 1980. Following its release, Killing Joke and Malicious Damage switched from Island Records to EG and the band released their eponymous debut album. The group began playing shows regularly throughout England and gained a reputation for being controversial. Their artwork often featured repulsive or inflammatory images, and after one of their concert posters pictured the Pope blessing legions of Nazis, the group was banned from performing a concert in Glasgow. Despite the controversy, the group began amassing a following of both punk and disco fans with hard-edged but danceable singles like \"Psyche\" and \"Follow the Leader.\" The band released its second album, What\\'s THIS For...!, in 1981.After recording and releasing the group\\'s third album, 1982\\'s Revelations, Jaz Coleman -- who had developed an obsession with the occult -- decided that the Apocalypse was near, so he left the group and ran away to Iceland with Geordie. While in Iceland, Coleman and Geordie worked with a number of Icelandic bands, most notably Theyr, which would later evolve into the Sugarcubes. Youth followed Coleman to Iceland shortly after his departure. After a few months with no sign of the end of the world, Youth returned to England and formed Brilliant with Ferguson. However, Ferguson left shortly after the group\\'s formation and moved to Iceland with Killing Joke\\'s new bassist, Paul Raven. Youth continued playing with Brilliant, while Killing Joke\\'s new lineup -- featuring Coleman, Geordie, Ferguson, and Raven -- worked in Iceland for a brief period. Soon, the group returned to England and recorded Fire Dances, which was released in 1983. Fire Dances demonstrated a calmer, more straightforward band than the one showcased on the group\\'s earlier records. For the rest of the \\'80s, Killing Joke continued to release albums, all of which failed to regain the audience they had in the early \\'80s. After 1988\\'s Outside the Gate, the group broke up, only to reunite two years later for Extremities, Dirt &amp; Various Repressed Emotions. Extremities featured a new drummer, Martin Atkins, and returned the band to the noisy dance experiments of their earlier records. Following its release, the group took a four-year break. In 1994, Killing Joke re-formed as a trio with Coleman, Geordie, and Youth and the group released Pandemonium, a harder-edged, heavier album than its previous records. Democracy (1996), a second self-titled album (2003), and the live celebration XXV Gathering! followed. After opening for the reunited Mötley Crüe on a 2004 tour of the U.K., the band settled in Prague to record its next album, Hosannas from the Basement of Hell, which appeared in 2006. In October of 2007, Paul Raven died of heart failure in Geneva, Switzerland. The original lineup of Coleman, Geordie, Youth, and Paul Ferguson all attended the funeral and decided to reunite in honor of both Raven and Killing Joke. After a worldwide tour, this lineup entered the studio and recorded the 2010 release Absolute Dissent. Touring and archival releases kept the band busy for the next few years with The Singles Collection: 1979-2012 arriving in 2013, while 2014 saw the release of both the remix set In Dub and the live album Down by the River. The reunited Killing Joke remained prolific, issuing a powerful new studio album, Pylon, in October 2015. In 2021, the group released In Dub Rewind (Vol. 1), a set of remixes created by Youth. The four-song EP Lord of Chaos, the band\\'s first studio effort in seven years, appeared in 2022. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; John Dougan, Rovi'\n",

Soon they were joined by the other members of what would become Turmion Kätilöt: Master Bates, Run-Q, DQ and Spellgoth as a second vocalist. With a couple of line-up changes as Dj Vastapallo left the band in 2009 replaced by Bobby Undertaker on guitars (ex-Deathchain) and Spellgoth leaving in 2017 replaced by Shag-U (Fear Of Domination) on vocals, Turmion Kätilöt has become the mean disco metal machine they are today. After 9 full length studio albums and playing their asses off at over 800 shows, the Finnish disco metal machine Turmion Kätilöt is ready for the next level in their world dominance. Their 10th full length studio album “Omen X” will be released in 36 countries on 13th January 2023 via Nuclear Blast. The touring cycle starts in Finland immediately after the release of Omen X. Band will play its biggest show ever in Helsinki Ice hall on 14th January 2023. After couple of shows in the home country “Omen X” will be served all over Europe with 20 gigs inFebruary 2023 – see the full show schedule below. From the very beginning Turmion Kätilöt has had a reputation of being a great live band. Disco beats from the 90's, metal to the pedal, melodies, sing-a-longs, you name it - there are no rules. Yet still if you peek under the skin you can find the darkness pointing its finger to you.\"\n",

      "'Similar in style and approach to such industrial metal outfits as Ministry and KMFDM, Gravity Kills followed in their predecessor\\'s path but ultimately failed to cause as big a splash. Guitarist Matt Dudenhoffer, keyboard player Douglas Firley, and bassist/drummer Kurt Kerns had been kicking around in various St. Louis, MO, bands since the mid-\\'80s, but the chance to land a song on a compilation by KPNT-FM got them together to record. The prospective hitmakers had no vocalist, however, so Kerns called his cousin, Jeff Scheel, in Dallas in 1994. The industrial-techno group recorded an original composition, called \"Guilty,\" in three days, called themselves Gravity Kills, and made the compilation. Soonafter, \"Guilty\" became the station\\'s most-requested song and gathered airplay around the U.S. and Canada, leading to the group signing a recording contract with Wax Trax!/TVT. Gravity Kills\\' appeal was widened by appearances on the soundtracks for Mortal Kombat and Seven and in March of 1996, the quartet released a self-titled debut album, promoting the release by supporting the Sex Pistols on their reunion tour of America. 1997 saw the release of a remix collection, called Manipulated, and a year later, their second all-new studio album Perversion. Not much was heard from Gravity Kills for the next few years, which led to rumors that the group had broken up. Although Kerns left the group during this interim period, the breakup rumors ultimately proved to be false; after switching record labels (their new home is Sanctuary Records), Gravity Kills issued their fourth release, Superstarved, in March of 2002. Shortly after the album\\'s release the band announced that they would be ceasing all operations, and they spent the next decade playing the occasional one-off show and fending off rumours of a possible return to the recording studio. ~ Greg Prato &amp; John Bush, Rovi'\n",

      "'Although White Zombie received most of the credit for mixing tales of sex, Satan, and gore with a rock/dance beat (although admittedly with more of a heavy metal edge), Chicago\\'s My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult specialized in similar territory for just as long. Originally formed in 1987 by Buzz McCoy (who had relocated from Boston) and Groovie Mann, the duo sought to create a worthy musical accompaniment that could be used as a soundtrack to trashy B-movies. The duo\\'s initial project was to make a movie (in the style of Russ Meyer and John Waters) to be named \"My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult.\" The movie never got off the ground, but McCoy and Mann used the aborted movie\\'s title for the name of their just-formed group, as their over-the-top stage show was best described as \"sensory overload\" (featuring a revolving door of weird characters, props, and intense visuals). Signing on with Chicago\\'s renowned industrial dance label Wax Trax!, Thrill Kill Kult issued several releases between 1989 and 1991: a self-titled EP, plus the full-lengths I See Good Spirits and I See Bad Spirits, Kooler Than Jesus, Confessions of a Knife, and Sexplosion! By this time, the group had attracted the attention of Interscope Records, which signed up Thrill Kill Kult and reissued Sexplosion!, which had spawned perhaps the group\\'s best-known song, \"Sex on Wheelz\" (the track would also be featured in director Ralph Bakshi\\'s animated movie Cool World). The group only issued one more release for Interscope, 1994\\'s 13 Above the Night, before switching to the Rykodisc label and issuing further releases such as 1995\\'s Hit &amp; Run Holiday (a concept album of sorts, which told the tale of \"rebellious vixen\" Krystal Starlust and her \"fatal attraction\" to a drifter named Apollo) and 1997\\'s Crime for All Seasons. The Thrill Kill Kult failed to issue any new studio recordings from 1998 through 2000, while a collection of 18 remixes, Dirty Little Secrets, saw the light of day in 1999. But by 2001, the band had reappeared once more, issuing 2001\\'s The Reincarnation of Luna and 2002\\'s Golden Pillz: The Luna Remixes for yet another new record label, Invisible. In 2004, the Ryko label acquired most of Wax Trax!\\'s releases, including early albums from the Kult. That same year they reissued the band\\'s first three albums and released a new compilation, The Best of TKK, along with a set of remixes named Diamonds &amp; Daggerz. An album dedicated to the disco era that had sat on the shelves for a decade finally saw the light of day in 2005 when Gay, Black &amp; Married hit the shelves. Two years later, the lounge-styled Filthiest Show in Town appeared.In 2009, the band introduced their own label SleazeBox with the album Death Threat, plus the remix/re-recordings collection Sinister Whisperz: The Wax Trax Years. A lineup still anchored by McCoy and Mann toured the U.S. in 2012 for their 25th anniversary, and also released their 12th album, Spooky Tricks, in 2014. In 2017, Thrill Kill Kult mounted a complete run through their first two albums on the 30th anniversary of their founding.In addition to their own releases, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult have contributed tracks to several film soundtracks, including Paul Verhoeven\\'s Showgirls, Gregg Araki\\'s Nowhere, and the hit movie The Crow (the group made a cameo appearance in the latter).

      "'Born out of a chance meeting in rehab between Cameron Heacock and Chad Hanks, Minneapolis-based industrial metal collective American Head Charge match their brutally executed music with their behavior. Heacock and Hanks, now known as Martin Cock and Mr. H.C. Banks III, formed AHC in the late \\'90s, releasing their critically acclaimed debut, War of Art, in 2001. The record scored the band -- which by then included guitarist Bryan Ottoson, keyboardist Justin Fowler, and drummer Christopher Emery -- a coveted slot on that year\\'s Ozzfest tour, at which point the group splintered into a violent, drug-fueled nonentity that became known more for its on-stage/backstage mayhem than for its excellent musicianship. As the year progressed, the bandmembers, despite frequent trips back to rehab and the occasional near-suicidal meltdown, managed to continue to filter their rage into creativity, resulting in their 2005 ambitious sophomore effort, Feeding, their first for the Nitrus/DRT label. That same year saw the tragic death of guitarist Bryan Ottoson, who died of an accidental prescription drug overdose while on tour in support of the album. A live CD/DVD, Can\\'t Stop the Machine, dropped in early 2007, but by 2009 the band had officially called it quits. In 2011 rumours began to surface about a possible AHC reunion, and surely enough, by 2012 a new single appeared, \"Sugars of Someday,\" in anticipation of the band\\'s 2013 comeback EP, Shoot. The following year saw the band raising money to finance the recording of their fourth studio long player. They eventually met and exceeded their goals, and headed to Kentucky\\'s Third Sky studios to begin laying down tracks. The resulting Tango Umbrella dropped in March, 2016 via Napalm Records. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

Debuting in 2002 with Synthetic Generation, the band found regional success before taking their dark wares to the masses with the release of 2009\\'s internationally charting Night Electric Night. They continued to refine their signature death-glam sound on subsequent efforts The Perfect Cult (2014) and Everything Destroys You (2023). Founded in 2000 in Stockholm, Deathstars formed around a lineup consisting of vocalist Whiplasher Bernadotte (Andreas Bergh), guitarist/keyboardist Nightmare Industries (Emil Nödtveidt), guitarist Cat Casino (Eric Bäckman), bassist Skinny Disco (Jonas Kangur), and drummer Bone W Machine (Ole Öhman). Prior to founding Deathstars, Nightmare Industries and Bone W Machine were members of the black metal band Swordmaster, founded in 1993. Deathstars made their album debut in 2002 with Synthetic Generation on LED Recordings. It was reasonably successful for an independent label release, reaching the Swedish charts, and it earned the band a recording deal with the European division of Nuclear Blast, which reissued the album internationally in 2003. Deathstars\\' second album, Termination Bliss (2006), was also a minor hit, reaching the Swedish charts, and the band was chosen to support black metal heavyweights and cited influence Cradle of Filth on their 2006 tour of Europe. Their follow-up album, Night Electric Night (2009), was Deathstars\\' biggest success to date, reaching the Top Ten in Sweden and charting in several other European countries. The amicable departures of Bone W Machine (replaced by Oscar \"Vice\" Leander) in 2011 and Cat Casino in 2013 preceded the arrival of the band\\'s fourth studio album. Released in 2014, The Perfect Cult saw Deathstars deliver a more synth-driven, though no less hard-rocking set of fist-pumping goth-metal anthems. Vice left the fold in 2017, making way for new drummer Nitro. Cat Casino returned to the group shortly after that, and the band began working on their fifth long-player. Initially slated for release in 2020, Everything Destroys You was pushed to 2023 after the COVID-19 pandemic halted touring and recording, marking the longest gap between Deathstars records.

If you want to hear this story from him, it would be short and straight to the point: “PAIN was just me f*cking around in the studio, and it grew into becoming a band”.Started as a one-man project with all the vocals, instruments parts, and production made by one person… Well, it still is, but not only. It also became a prominent touring group that today consists of, apart from Peter, his son Sebastian Tägtgren (drums), Jonathan Olsson (bass), and Sebastian Svalland (guitar).Nevertheless, a long time ago, in 1997, when the debut album of the project was released, there was nobody but Peter. By this time, he already had four successful albums with Hypocrisy – and also had some ideas that wouldn't go with the band's style.That's how the story of PAIN began – the story where 8 albums are known and loved for such smashing hits as ‘End Of The Line', ‘Shut Your Mouth', ‘Same Old Song', ‘Follow Me', ‘Coming Home' and many more.

      "'One of the most consistent industrial bands of the 1980s, even though they regularly pursued a more electronic variant of the sound that swept into vogue during the \\'90s, Front 242 were the premier exponent of European electronic body music. Initially, the group was just a duo when formed in October 1981 in Brussels; programmers Patrick Codenys and Dirk Bergen recorded \"Principles\" and released the single on New Dance Records. A year later, programmer Daniel Bressanutti (aka Daniel B. Prothese) and lead vocalist Jean-Luc de Meyer joined as well; dubbed Front 242 because of the name\\'s universal meaning and united connotations, the quartet debuted in 1982 with the single \"U-Men\" and album Geography, recorded for Red Rhino Europe Records (RRE).Not dissimilar to Depeche Mode and other synthesizer bands at the time, Front 242 began playing live later that year, adding percussionist Geoff Bellingham but later replacing him with an ex-roadie, Richard 23 (born Richard Jonckheere). (Dirk Bergen also left the working band, but stayed on to direct management.) The group\\'s sound began to grow more aggressive with 1984\\'s No Comment EP, still reminiscent of synth pop but with harder-hitting rhythms and added menace from de Meyer\\'s vocals. By 1987, Front 242 had gained an American contract through Chicago\\'s Wax Trax!, the home of a diverse group of mostly European aggressive synthesizer acts later lumped together as exponents of industrial rock. Wax Trax! reissued much of the group\\'s recordings (including the rarities collection Back Catalogue) and released a new album, Official Version. The first Front 242 LP to coalesce as a consistent recording, the album contained several cold-wave club hits (\"Masterhit,\" \"Quite Unusual\") and, for the time, excellent production values. Released in 1988, third LP Front by Front was undoubtedly the group\\'s best yet, with more emphasis on song structure than loose mechanistic grooves. Besides the alternative club hits \"Headhunter\" and \"Never Stop,\" the record was Front 242\\'s most consistent.By the end of the decade, Front 242 had become the first Wax Trax! artist to make the jump to a mainstream label; Epic Records picked up the band\\'s contract, reissuing each past album with new artwork and bonus tracks. The single \"Tragedy (For You)\" became another alternative club hit, and picked up rotation on MTV as well. Though the following album, Tyranny (For You), couldn\\'t touch Front by Front in terms of quality, it made great strides for the group in the minds of audiences -- by the time of its release in 1991, Front 242 was, with Ministry and Skinny Puppy, one of the most well-known industrial acts in music.With nary a lineup change in the past ten years, however, Richard 23 finally left the group in 1993 after an American tour with the Lollapalooza festival (the trio replaced him with lyricists Jean-Marc Pauly and his brother Pierre). That same year Front 242 released two LPs, 06:21:03:11 Up Evil and 05:22:09:12 Off, the first closer to pop music than anything the group had recorded before, and the second more abrasive than previous recordings. In the wake of industrial music\\'s unlikely mainstream success -- which pushed unrestrained angst and raging guitars in the vein of Nine Inch Nails -- the Front 242 LPs were not well received. Vocalist De Meyer left the group in 1995 to sing with various projects, including Cobalt 60 and Bio-Tek. Front 242 released a live LP (Live Code) and a remix album (Mut@ge.Mix@ge) but for the most part remained quiet while flocks of industrial bands invaded the mainstream charts during the mid- to late \\'90s. In 1997 the group again toured and issued the live album Re-Boot a year later. Pulse, a studio album of new material, was released in CD and DVD formats in 2003. ~ John Bush, Rovi'\n",

Debuting with a self-titled 1988 EP and releasing the classic full-length Streetcleaner near the end of 1989, the Justin Broadrick-fronted group backed noisy, relentless guitar riffs and guttural growls with thudding drum machine rhythms. Subsequent albums like Pure (1992) and Songs of Love and Hate (1996) incorporated breakbeats and hip-hop influences, setting the stage for nu-metal, and the band also experimented with dub, dark ambient, and drum\\'n\\'bass (particularly on 1999\\'s Us and Them). They disbanded following 2001\\'s Hymns, and Broadrick named his next band, the shoegaze-influenced Jesu, after the album\\'s final track.

He formed O.P.D. (Officially Pronounced Dead) with B.C. Green and Paul Neville in 1982, renaming themselves Fall of Because after a Killing Joke song and a chapter from an Aleister Crowley book. The group (as well as Broadrick\\'s experimental solo project, Final) performed a scarcely-attended show with Napalm Death in 1984, and he joined the pioneering grindcore band as a guitarist for a brief time, appearing on the first side of their landmark 1987 debut recording, Scum. However, he left that band and joined Head of David as a drummer. He soon departed Head of David, and sought to form a new group that would be even more musically extreme and experimental. He reformed Fall of Because as a duo with Green and a drum machine, renaming the act Godflesh.The duo unleashed a pair of releases that sounded unlike anything at the time: the 1988 EP Godflesh and 1989\\'s full-length Streetcleaner. A healthy buzz began to build around the band, especially in the music press, though the commercial success of more accessible industrial metal bands (Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, etc.) eluded them, and Godflesh never broke out of \"cult\" status. Still, they were namechecked as a major influence by countless artists, including highly popular groups like Metallica and Korn. Godflesh continued issuing further EPs and full-lengths (1992\\'s Pure, 1994\\'s Selfless, 1996\\'s Songs of Love and Hate, and 1999\\'s Us and Them) throughout the \\'90s, gradually incorporating influences such as dub and drum\\'n\\'bass. Godflesh\\'s first best-of compilation, In All Languages, was issued in 2001, yet the early 21st century saw Godflesh enter a tumultuous period, when Green exited the group shortly after the release of a new studio album, Hymns, that same year. Although a replacement bassist was announced (former Killing Joke/Prong member Paul Raven), Broadrick announced Godflesh\\'s dissolution in 2002. As a final thank-you to longtime fans, Broadrick decided to re-release an expanded edition of Godflesh\\'s ultra-rare 1994-recorded EP, Messiah, in 2003. In addition to his work with Godflesh, Broadrick headed several record labels (including Head Dirt, Lo Fibre, and Avalanche); produced other artists; and also found time for a few side projects, such as Final, Techno Animal, and the Sidewinder, often in collaboration with Kevin Martin. In 2003, Broadrick formed Jesu, a more electronic, shoegaze-influenced successor to Godflesh.In 2009, Broadrick announced that Godflesh would be reuniting to play the 2010 Hellfest in Clisson, France. While details about other shows remained sparse, the band began to appear at other festivals around Europe, appearing at Roadburn in Holland and the Supersonic Festival in England. Rumblings of a new album began to emerge, and in 2013 the band released its first new material in 12 years, a cover of Slaughter\\'s \"F.O.D.\" The following year, Godflesh returned with two releases, an EP, Decline &amp; Fall, as well as the band\\'s seventh full-length album, A World Lit Only by Fire. In 2017, Godflesh released Post Self, an album that leaned closer to the group\\'s post-punk and industrial influences rather than metal. The album was issued by Avalanche, with a cassette edition on Hospital Productions. Remix collection New Flesh in Dub Vol. 1 and compilation Long Live the New Flesh (containing the previous two albums and EP plus remixes) appeared in 2021. Pure: Live was released in 2022, and the 2023 studio album Purge revisited the hip-hop influences of the original Pure. ~ Greg Prato &amp; Paul Simpson, Rovi'\n",

      "'Rumor has it the gents who make up Revolting Cocks came upon the name by their usual debauchery. Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen was out for a hard night of drinking with some friends, so hard that the bartender threw them out, declaring them a bunch of revolting cocks. The name was first applied to one of Jourgensen\\'s many side projects in 1985, when he partnered with Luc Van Acker and Front 242\\'s Richard 23 to bring art and the dancefloor closer together. As recordings progressed, things went in a different direction and the chaotic, snide, and sleazy sounds that were taking over had Richard 23 making an exit over creative differences. He departed in 1986, right as the band\\'s debut, Big Sexy Land, was being released by the seminal industrial label Wax Trax! The album featured the Blade Runner homage and club hit \"Attack Ships on Fire,\" while the artwork introduced \"the Three Guys,\" anonymous faces from an old photograph that would represent the band on album covers for years to come. Ministry associates Paul Barker, Chris Connelly, and Bill Rieflin would join Van Acker and Jourgensen for a tour supporting the album, recordings of which surfaced in 1988 on the live album and video You Goddamned Son of a Bitch. The nihilistic party attitude of the band had now officially taken over any grand artistic aspirations, and if the success of 1989\\'s Stainless Steel Providers didn\\'t prove their audience was right there with them, college radio and clubs being dominated by 1990\\'s \"Beers, Steers + Queers\" certainly did. Beers, Steers + Queers, the album, followed that same year and included two cover versions of \"(Let\\'s Get) Physical,\" one a simple loop of the word \"physical\" that goes on for 13 minutes. The band celebrated the album\\'s release by touring the country with the Skatenigs -- whose vocalist, Phil Owen, had contributed to Beers -- and the always-vile Mentors as support. Linger Ficken\\' Good... from 1993 was a more subdued album, but it was still shocking that the Warner Bros.-associated Sire released the album and helped the band score another club hit with their cover of Rod Stewart\\'s \"Da Ya Think I\\'m Sexy?\" Years passed and it seemed the Revco were officially over until 2004, when the track \"Prune Tang\" appeared on the Internet, announcing the coming of their next album, Purple Head. The Ryko label reissued the band\\'s first two albums that year with bonus tracks, but the new album failed to appear. A year later, a cover version of Bauhaus\\' \"Dark Entries\" with Butthole Surfer Gibby Haynes as vocalist appeared on the Saw II soundtrack. Haynes joined Jello Biafra, Cheap Trick\\'s Rick Nielsen and Robin Zander, Davíd Garza, and ZZ Top\\'s Billy Gibbons, along with veterans Jourgensen and Owen (now known as Phildo Owen) for 2006\\'s Cocked and Loaded.

      "'Pig is the main project of British musician Raymond Watts, a founding member of German industrial stalwarts KMFDM. Grittier and more experimental than many of the more well-known industrial acts, Pig\\'s early albums, such as 1988\\'s A Poke in the Eye... with a Sharp Stick, incorporated jazz and orchestral influences, not unlike sometime collaborator Foetus, along with metal guitars and complex dance beats. Subsequent albums were harder and more guitar-driven, yet featured surprising elements like the Latin rhythms on 1999\\'s Genuine American Monster. After 2005\\'s Pigmata, the project went on hiatus for a decade, returning with fellow KMFDM founder En Esch in the fold on 2016\\'s The Gospel. This kicked off a prolific run of albums which included 2019\\'s Candy, an eclectic collection of covers, and the back-to-basics industrial rock of 2020\\'s Pain Is God.Raymond Watts was born in London in 1961. Active as an engineer, producer, and musician since the early \\'80s, he worked with industrial acts such as Psychic TV, Coil-related project Zos Kia, Foetus, and Einstürzende Neubauten, as well as indie pop group the Hit Parade. He was also one of the founding members of the performance art ensemble originally known as Kein Mehrheit für die Mitleid, which would only later develop a more musical focus and become known as KMFDM. He left that band in its early stages and, as Pig, released a number of albums. The Wax Trax! label issued his debut LP, 1988\\'s A Poke in the Eye... with a Sharp Stick, and his first two singles. He followed with Praise the Lard (on Concrete Productions) in 1991. He would soon form a relationship with an A&amp;R man at Alfa Entertainment, which released his albums The Swining and Red Raw &amp; Sore, initially in Japan only. Watts also produced Je M\\'Aime, the 1994 debut by Sow (Anna Wildsmith), which was later reissued and credited to Pig &amp; Sow. When Watts\\' A&amp;R contact moved to Victor, Watts followed and issued several albums through them, including the 1995 full-length Sinsation (issued in America the following year by Trent Reznor\\'s Nothing Records). That year, he also returned to KMFDM to help them record their seventh album, Nihil. Wrecked arrived in 1996, with an American release following in 1997 on Wax Trax!/TVT. The music featured on Watts\\' albums evolved over the years to become increasingly complex, incorporating German, British, and Japanese pop music elements and a variety of electronic idioms. The No One Gets Out of Her Alive EP appeared in 1998. In 1999, Cleopatra Records re-released the two Alfa albums as a single volume, resurrecting one of the strongest periods in his career. Genuine American Monster was issued in Japan the same year (Metropolis re-released it three years later). He performed with KMFDM for a few more years, and was co-credited on their live release Sturm &amp; Drang Tour 2002.Two years later, Watts released the hard-rocking Pigmartyr under his own surname, producing a remastered version titled Pigmata that arrived in 2005, as the seventh Pig studio album. Watts would sideline the Pig project for a decade, though he released a few projects under his own name, including the 2010 EP Mellan Rummen (with Dr. Shinto), composed as the soundtrack to a book by Daniel Watson. As Pig, he guested on \"Bin Therre,\" the 2013 single by Mekon (frequent collaborator John Gosling). Pig returned in 2015 with a pair of collaborative EPs (Compound Eye Sessions with Cubanate\\'s Marc Heal, aka MC Lord of the Flies, and Long in the Tooth with industrial rock supergroup Primitive Race). En Esch, one of KMFDM\\'s other founding members, officially joined Pig in 2016, and their eighth LP, The Gospel, was released that year, with a remix album, Swine &amp; Punishment, landing in 2017. Studio effort Risen appeared in June of 2018, and a few months later, the group released a cover of KC &amp; the Sunshine Band\\'s \"That\\'s the Way (I Like It)\" with musician and adult film star Sasha Grey. Following 2019 remix collection Stripped &amp; Whipped, the Grey collaboration appeared on Candy, an entire album of covers, issued by U.K. label Armalyte Industries. After another remix album for the label, 2020\\'s Stripped &amp; Ripped, as well as a trio of independently released EPs, Pig returned to Metropolis with Pain Is God, which included versions of material from the EPs as well as the KMFDM song \"Kickin Ass.\" ~ Stacia Proefrock &amp; Neil Z.

      "'Britain\\'s Nitzer Ebb are one of the most influential acts associated with the EBM (electronic body music) scene, as well as alternative dance in general. Since the early \\'80s, the group, led by enthusiastic frontman Douglas McCarthy, have produced an aggressive, visceral brand of electronic music influenced by German industrial and new wave groups like Die Krupps and D.A.F. The group remains best known for the classic \"Join in the Chant,\" a single taken from 1987\\'s That Total Age that became a staple of dance clubs from Ibiza to Detroit. Subsequent albums such as 1991\\'s Ebbhead displayed more of an interest in pop songcraft, and found some success on alternative radio. Nitzer Ebb broke up following 1995\\'s Big Hit, which featured a greater presence of non-electronic instruments, but they reunited over a decade later, as their influence on newer generations of industrial and hard-edged techno artists continued to grow. After Industrial Complex appeared in 2010, Nitzer Ebb went on hiatus again, but they re-formed with all of their founding members in 2018 for a tour and retrospective box set.Formed in Chelmsford, Essex, in 1982 by vocalist Douglas McCarthy, drummer Bon Harris, and keyboard player David Gooday, the group began experimenting with synthesizers and drum pads, fusing the bandmembers\\' affinity for dark goth and punk rock with the emerging technology. A demo cassette titled Basic Pain Procedure appeared in 1983. After several popular shows around London during 1984, PWL producer Phil Harding began working with Nitzer Ebb and recorded their first single, \"Isn\\'t It Funny How Your Body Works,\" which appeared on the band\\'s Power of Voice Communications label in 1985. Three more singles followed during 1985-1986 before Nitzer Ebb signed to Mute in late 1986; the first Mute recordings were the singles \"Murderous\" and \"Let Your Body Learn\" in early 1987, just before the release of their debut album, That Total Age. After the single \"Join in the Chant\" was remixed by producer Flood (Nick Cave, Erasure), it became one of the crucial tracks in the growing alternative/Balearic dance scene, played out alongside Chicago house, Detroit techno, and Northern soul.After the release of That Total Age, Nitzer Ebb toured Europe with Depeche Mode, and the latter band\\'s pop sensibilities appeared to inspire them. By the time of their second album, Belief, Gooday had disappeared (to be replaced by Julian Beeston) and Flood had taken over the producer\\'s role from Harding, nudging Nitzer Ebb closer to the dancefloor and shearing away the militaristic bent of much of their earlier recordings. Singles like \"Hearts and Minds,\" \"Shame,\" and \"Lightning Man\" were loaded with the cold aggression of earlier recordings, working well on dancefloors as well as college radio stations; the 1990 single \"Fun to Be Had\" even reached number two on the dance charts. The following year\\'s Ebbhead further consolidated their position with alternative audiences, with at least two well-known singles, \"I Give to You\" and \"Godhead.\" Nitzer Ebb virtually disappeared from active music-making for the next four years, finally reappearing in 1995 with their fifth (and least industrial-sounding) album, Big Hit. The group became inactive, but McCarthy became a regular collaborator with Alan Wilder\\'s Recoil project, and formed the duo Fixmer/McCarthy with techno producer Terence Fixmer. The compilation Body of Work 1984-1997 appeared in 2006 and was immediately followed by set of new remixes titled Body Rework. After a reunion tour to support the releases proved successful, the group began working on new material. In January of 2010 they released Industrial Complex, their first studio album in 15 years and their first for the Alpha Matrix label. Nitzer Ebb then toured with Die Krupps, issuing the joint EP Join in the Rhythm of Machines in 2011. The following year, Basic Pain Procedure was reissued by Pylon Records.Box Set [1982-2010] was released in 2018, containing double-LP reissues of Nitzer Ebb\\'s five albums for Mute, as well as empty slots for their other two full-lengths, which remained in print. Additionally, the band\\'s original lineup began performing for the first time since 1987. ~ John Bush &amp; Paul Simpson, Rovi'\n",

It was all unexpected. But I decided not to resist it either.”Driven by primal forces seemingly beyond his control, Big Mess marks Elfman's first solo collection in more than thirty years, but it's no return to form. Clocking in at 18 tracks, the sprawling, ambitious double album finds the Grammy and Emmy Award-winning composer breaking bold new ground as both a writer and a performer, drawing on a dystopian palette of distorted electric guitars, industrial synthesizers and orchestra in an effort to exorcise the demons brought about by four years of creeping fascism and civil rot. The songs here call to mind everything from Nine Inch Nails, to David Bowie to XTC at times, balancing dense, harmonically complex arrangements with biting, acerbic wit as they reckon with the chaos and confusion of the modern world. Elfman wrote almost all of the record during quarantine, and while the anger, frustration, and isolation of it all is palpable in his delivery, Big Mess is about more than simply blowing off steam. In making the space to truly sit with his emotions and write without limitations, Elfman achieved a kind of artistic liberation on the record that had been eluding him for decades, rediscovering his voice and reinventing himself all at once in the process.\"\n",

A visceral voice gleaming above raw, modular synthesis, driving analogue beats and chilling cinematic ambience fused with singing as heartfelt as the stories sung, soaringto a new level of art. While drawing from a lurid past in and with acts such as Marilyn Manson, KMFDM, oHgr, Motionless In White, and parallel endeavors Psyclon Nine and SKOLD, NOT MY GOD stands to culminate a storied history.'\n",

      "'As a solo artist, prolific Swedish producer and singer/songwriter Tim Skold issues his corrosive industrial metal under the moniker Skold. Although he made his debut in the \\'80s as frontman of Swedish glam metal outfit Shotgun Messiah (fka Kingpin), he found his dark calling in the mid-\\'90s as a rebranded solo artist bent on moving the body as much as disturbing the mind. Skold\\'s self-titled debut featured nihilistic anthems that veered close to contemporaries like Gravity Kills and Chemlab, as well as early-era Nine Inch Nails. Through the decades -- bouncing between solo efforts like Anomie (2011), The Undoing (2016), and Seven Heads (2023), and collaborative stints with like-minded acts such as KMFDM/MDFMK and Marilyn Manson -- he maintained his solo artistic trajectory while also producing and performing with Newlydeads, Ohgr, Doctor Midnight &amp; the Mercy Cult, and Motionless in White.Born Thim Sköld in Skövde, Sweden, he grew up in an open family environment and spent his younger years inspired by Kiss and David Bowie, and learning bass guitar. Skold met future bandmate Harry Cody during his teen years; the pair went on to form the glam metal band Kingpin in the late \\'80s. After releasing their debut, they changed their name to Shotgun Messiah and issued an additional three albums, including 1989\\'s eponymous effort that included their most prominent single, \"Shout It Out.\" Bowing out with their final LP, Violent New Breed, Shotgun Messiah ended and Skold struck out as a solo artist.Already dabbling in industrial by the end of the Shotgun Messiah years, Skold plunged into this full rebranding on his 1996 debut, Skold (RCA). A harsh blend of Gravity Kills and Broken-era NIN, Skold included the single \"Chaos\" and was produced by Scott Humphrey (Rob Zombie, Powerman 5000). During promotion of the album, Skold met Sascha Konietzko, frontman of KMFDM. Focus soon switched from a burgeoning solo career to an official role with the industrial dance outfit as, just a year later, Skold had joined the band and contributed to their tenth album, Symbols. Skold remained with the group into the early 2000s, co-writing and co-producing Adios, Attak, and the transitional offshoot, MDFMK.While with KMFDM, Skold assisted Marilyn Manson with his 2001 cover of \"Tainted Love.\" The following year, that partnership flowered into an official position in Manson\\'s band, with Skold replacing Twiggy Ramirez on bass and joining as producer. Now with a new band, Skold plunged headlong into Manson\\'s world, putting his stamp on 2002\\'s The Golden Age of Grotesque; 2004\\'s cover of \"Personal Jesus\"; a 2006 reimagining of \"This Is Halloween\" from The Nightmare Before Christmas; and 2007\\'s Eat Me, Drink Me. In 2008, Ramirez was back in the band and Skold returned to KMFDM. In his absence, Konietzko and co. had issued a trio of albums, but the partnership returned with vigor in 2009 on two albums released just a month apart: Skold vs. KMFDM and Blitz. And just as quickly as Skold rejoined KMFDM, he was back on his own.Although he had continued writing solo material during his time with Manson -- 2002\\'s scrapped \"Disrupting the Orderly Routine of the Institution\" recordings became a popular fan bootleg, exchanged online as the Dead God EP and often erroneously attributed to Marilyn Manson due to sonic similarities -- Skold wouldn\\'t release an official sophomore effort until 2011, 15 years after his solo debut. Anomie included the single \"Suck.\" Within a month, Skold unveiled yet another project, Doctor Midnight &amp; The Mercy Cult. The supergroup featured members of Turbonegro, Cadaver, Apoptygma Berzerk, and Extol and peddled a sleazy mixture of sludge rock and industrial metal which was heard on their debut, I Declare: Treason (Season of Mist).By 2014, Skold had entered the studio to record another solo effort, which didn\\'t arrive until 2016. His third LP, The Undoing (Metropolis) landed at an ideal time, when younger bands such as Youth Code and 3Teeth were doing their best to bolster an industrial revival.Three decades after his debut, Skold released his electro-industrial-leaning fourth solo effort, Never Is Now, in April 2019, with the more metallic Dies Irae arriving in 2021. Two years later, he unveiled the hard-hitting Seven Heads, a heavy groove-driven set of apocalyptic industrial metal. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'\n",

So yes, it references our instruments and also this kind of music, where we're carrying on the tradition of the greats like Sabbath and Dio but also bands the guys are connected to, like Rainbow, Pantera and Priest.”As for the music, Richie describes it as “a mix of Jimi Hendrix, Priest, Sabbath, solo Ozzy and Black Label Society, but with a lot of melody, sort of old school and modern at once if that makes any sense, and actually down-tuned a whole step. The Marshall Plexi basically does one thing, but you've got to crank it to 11 for it to have that distorted sound. It hasn't got a lot of bells and whistles on it or different channels and effects. It basically does one thing and does it very well.

      "'Striking a balance between \\'80s underground thrash metal and metallic early-\\'90s alternative rock, Armenian-American quartet System of a Down effectively pushed their socially conscious, politically charged messages into the mosh pits during the turn of the century\\'s nu-metal wave. Their dark and wild style led them from a cult following to a full-blown movement with breakout hit Toxicity, which debuted at number one in 2001 and planted them at the top of the charts through the early 2000s with a pair of related albums, Mezmerize and Hypnotize. Soon afterward, the band took an extended hiatus, branching off into various solo projects while maintaining a cultural presence with sporadic concerts and continued efforts to spread awareness of the Armenian genocide. They would not return until 2020 when they released their first fresh material in 15 years, \"Protect the Land\" b/w \"Genocidal Humanoidz,\" the proceeds of which went to the humanitarian needs of families displaced by the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.Vocalist Serj Tankian, guitarist Daron Malakian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, and drummer John Dolmayan formed System of a Down in Southern California in the mid-\\'90s. They quickly earned a strong following in Los Angeles, largely based on strong word of mouth. A three-song demo began circulating through metal collectors, and their fan base soon spread throughout not only America, but Europe and New Zealand. By the end of 1997 the group had signed to American, distributed by Columbia Records. American/Columbia released the group\\'s eponymous debut in the summer of 1998, securing the band opening spots on the Slayer and Ozzfest tours. Carried by alternative radio hits \"Sugar\" and \"Spiders,\" System eventually went platinum, leading to the September 2001 release of the even more ambitious Toxicity. Their first chart-topper, System\\'s second effort was another heavy music triumph, shaming the majority of their nu-metal competition and running away with multi-platinum honors around the world. Featuring the singles \"Chop Suey!\" and \"Aerials,\" the album would become a landmark release for the period and their defining statement.Without losing momentum, Malakian started the eatURmusic imprint, and Tankian founded a label called Serjical Strike; Tankian also collaborated with Armenian avant-garde folk musician Arto Tuncboyaciyan in a project called Serart. In November 2002 System issued the bare-bones but no less powerful odds-n-ends set Steal This Album!, culled from the Toxicity sessions. By 2004, System of a Down was back in the studio with Rick Rubin. The bold result of those sessions was a single epic album released in two parts. Mezmerize/Hypnotize kept System\\'s furious creativity alive, incorporating the wild vocal melodies, lyrical passion, and rabid structural shifts that had become their trademark. Mezmerize (Pt. 1) appeared in May 2005, while Hypnotize (Pt. 2) appeared later in the year, and both hit the top of the album charts. The following year, the group went on hiatus, with Malakian forming Scars on Broadway; Dolmayan opening an online comic book store and forming the group Indicator (he also briefly played with Scars on Broadway); Odadjian working with RZA, AcHoZeN, and George Clinton, and Tankian embarking on a solo career. While they toured off-and-on throughout the 2010s, the foursome remained split, working on their personal musical projects while continuing to raise awareness for Armenian causes. One of those -- the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war -- prompted System to reunite for the charity single \"Protect the Land\" b/w \"Genocidal Humanoidz,\" which raised over half-a-million dollars for families displaced by the fighting. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Neil Z.

They regularly headline some of the biggest stages and festivals in the world.  Foregone, the furious fourteenth studio album, combines the greatest aggressive, metallic, and melodic strengths of their landmark records with the seasoned songwriting of their postmodern era. A sense of pride, accomplishment, and continued vitality are evident every time the band takes the stage, and all over Foregone. Melodic death metal pioneers and innovative purveyors of groove, the artistry, influence, stature, and future of In Flames loom as large as the heavy metal horizon itself.\"\n",

      "'From its origins in a Nevada jail cell, post-hardcore outfit Falling in Reverse went on to achieve significant success in the 2010s. Fronted by former Escape the Fate frontman Ronnie Radke, the band notched a gold record on their first attempt with 2011\\'s The Drug in Me Is You. Over the ensuing years, Radke and stalwart guitarist Derek Jones led Falling in Reverse through numerous lineups and a succession of consistently charting albums including 2015\\'s Just Like You and 2017\\'s Coming Home. Following 2019\\'s hit stand-alone single \"Popular Monster,\" Jones died unexpectedly, and Radke soldiered on into the next decade with a new lineup that produced the 2022 EP Neon Zombie.Falling in Reverse was formed by Radke while he was serving time in Nevada\\'s High Desert State Prison for a 2008 parole violation. While imprisoned, Radke recruited guitarists Derek Jones and Jacky Vincent, drummer Ryan Seaman, and bassist Mika Horiuchi to help him realize the musical vision he was creating in his head while behind bars, meeting with his bandmates during visiting hours and spending the rest of his time writing. After serving two and a half years of a four-year sentence, Radke was released in late 2010, and the band set to work on their debut, bringing their driving, melodic sound to life in 2011 with the release of The Drug in Me Is You. Horiuchi left the band and was replaced by Ron Ficarro in early 2012. That year, Radke and the new lineup returned to the studio to record their sophomore release, Fashionably Late. Released in the middle of 2013, the album saw the band adding hip-hop and electronic elements to their original post-hardcore sound. The album fared well on the charts but received little support from critics. The band kicked off a tour in support of the effort, which was cut short by the birth of Radke\\'s son. In early 2014, Falling in Reverse hit the road again, this time with Radke\\'s former band, Escape the Fate, on the Bury the Hatchet tour. Ficarro parted ways with the band once the tour concluded, his slot filled by Escape the Fate\\'s Max Green (who ended up leaving the band after just five months, replaced by Zakk Sandler).The band\\'s third studio long-player, Just Like You (Epitaph), arrived in early 2015 and fared better with critics. Keeping Fashionably Late\\'s experiments with hip-hop on the sidelines, Just Like You saw the band returning to a heavier and more scream-centric focus. They toured for much of the year, parting with longtime guitarist Jacky Vincent that October, and continuing promotion with his replacement, Christian Thompson. Their fourth album, Coming Home, arrived in 2017 bearing a slightly more diverse and emotive sound. Not long after its release, drummer Ryan Seaman left the band while a handful of different sticksmen filled in for him. Over the next few years, Falling in Reverse switched their focus to non-album singles and landed a chart-topper in 2019\\'s platinum-selling \"Popular Monster.\" Guitarist and founding member Derek Jones died on April 21, 2020; he was 35 years old. A few months after his death, the group released the single \"Carry On.\" With Radke now the only original member, he retooled a lineup that included guitarists Christian Thompson and Max Georgiev, bassist Tyler Burgess, and touring drummer Luke Holland for the band\\'s next phase. Co-producing with Dangerkids singer Tyler Smith, Falling in Reverse issued the 2022 EP Neon Zombie. The band kicked off 2023 with \"Watch the World Burn,\" which became their first single to rank on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. ~ Gregory Heaney &amp; Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'\n",

      "'The preeminent metal band of the early to mid-\\'90s, Pantera put to rest any and all remnants of the \\'80s metal scene, almost single-handedly demolishing any notion that hair metal, speed metal, power metal, et al., were anything but passé. Loathe to admit it, the Texas band had in fact been one of those \\'80s metal bands, releasing fairly unsuccessful (and later disowned) glam-inspired music throughout much of the decade. The about-face came with the addition of vocalist Phil Anselmo, and the key turning point was the band\\'s major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell (1990). Pantera\\'s mainstream breakthrough came next with Vulgar Display of Power (1992), their second major-label album, which thrust the band to the forefront of the metal scene, alongside such veteran bands as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, as well as fellow up-and-comers Sepultura and White Zombie. By the time Pantera unleashed Far Beyond Driven (1994), after two long years of touring, they were the most popular metal band in the land: the new album debuted atop the Billboard Top 200 as its lead single, \"I\\'m Broken,\" was getting massive airplay.At the height of their popularity and influence, Pantera began to self-destruct. Less than two months after the release of The Great Southern Trendkill (1996) -- an album ridden with allusions to drug abuse and personal destruction -- Anselmo overdosed on heroin after a homecoming concert in Texas, and as tensions rose between him and his fellow bandmembers, he began engaging with a growing list of side projects that kept him away from Pantera. A live album, Official Live: 101 Proof (1997), was compiled for release when it became evident that no new studio album was forthcoming any time soon. One final studio album did result, Reinventing the Steel (2000), but that was more or less it for the briefly reunited Pantera. The bandmembers once again went their separate ways, forming such bands as Damageplan, Down, and Superjoint Ritual. The end of Pantera then became official on December 8, 2004, when guitarist Dimebag Darrell was murdered on-stage by a deranged fan. This much-publicized murder shone the spotlight back on Pantera for an extended moment, and amid all of the emotional outpouring and tributes, a consensus arose: in retrospect, there was no greater metal band during the early to mid-\\'90s than Pantera, who inspired a legion of rabid fans and whose oft-termed \"groove metal\" style bucked all prevailing trends of the day -- from hair metal and grunge to nu-metal and rap-metal -- and remains singular to this day, as defined by the vocals of Anselmo as it is by the guitar of Dimebag. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

      "'Motörhead\\'s overwhelmingly loud and fast style of heavy metal was one of the most groundbreaking sounds the genre had to offer in the late \\'70s. Though the group\\'s leader, Lemmy Kilmister, had his roots in the hard-rocking space rock band Hawkwind, Motörhead didn\\'t bother with his old group\\'s progressive tendencies, choosing to amplify the heavy biker-rock elements of Hawkwind with the speed of punk rock. Motörhead wasn\\'t punk rock (they formed before the Sex Pistols and they loved the hell-for-leather imagery of bikers too much to conform with the safety-pinned, ripped T-shirts of punk), but they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created speed metal and thrash metal. Unlike many of their contemporaries, Motörhead continued performing into the next century. Although they changed their lineup many, many times -- Lemmy, who passed away in 2015, was their only consistent member -- they never changed their raging sound.The son of a vicar, Lemmy (born Ian Fraiser Kilmister, December 24, 1945) first began playing rock &amp; roll in 1964, when he joined two local Blackpool, England R&amp;B bands, the Rainmakers and the Motown Sect. Over the course of the \\'60s, he played with a number of bands -- including the Rockin\\' Vickers, Gopal\\'s Dream, and Opal Butterfly -- as well as briefly working as a roadie for Jimi Hendrix. In 1971, he joined the heavy prog rock band Hawkwind as bassist. Lemmy was originally slated to stay with the band only six months, but he stayed with the group for four years. During that time, he wrote and sang several songs with the band, including their signature track, the number three U.K. hit \"Silver Machine\" (1972).Lemmy was kicked out of Hawkwind in the spring of 1975 after he spent five days in a Canadian prison for drug possession. Once he returned to England, Kilmister set about forming a new band. Originally, it was to have been called Bastard, but he soon decided to call the band Motörhead, named after the last song he wrote for Hawkwind. Lemmy drafted in Pink Fairies guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox to round out the lineup. Motörhead made their debut supporting Greenslade in July. Two months later, the group headed into the studio to make their debut album for United Artists with producer Dave Edmunds. Motörhead and Edmunds clashed over the direction of the recording, resulting in the group firing the producer and replacing him with Fritz Fryer. At the end of the year, Fox left the band and Lemmy replaced him with his friend Philthy Animal (born Philip Taylor), an amateur musician.Motörhead delivered its debut album to UA early in 1976, but the label rejected it. Shortly afterward, former Blue Goose and Continuous Performance guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke joined the band. Following one rehearsal as a four-piece, Wallis left the band, leaving Motörhead a trio; this is the lineup that would later be recalled as the group\\'s classic period. The band spent most of 1976 struggling, however, performing without a contract or manager and generating little money. At the end of the year, they cut a single, \"White Line Fever\"/\"Leavin\\' Here,\" for Stiff Records that wasn\\'t released until two years later. By the summer of 1977, they had signed a one-record contract with Chiswick Records, releasing their eponymous debut in June; it peaked at number 43 on the U.K. charts. A year later, the band signed with Bronze Records.Overkill, Motörhead\\'s first album for Bronze, was released in the spring of 1979. The album peaked at number 24, while its title track became the band\\'s first Top 40 hit. Motörhead continued to gain momentum, as their concerts were selling well and Bomber, the follow-up to Overkill, reached number 12 upon its fall release. The band was doing so well that UA released the rejected album at the end of the year as On Parole. Ace of Spades, released in the fall of 1980, became a number four hit, while the single of the same name reached number 15.Ace of Spades became Motörhead\\'s first American album, but they were making little headway in the U.S., where they only registered as a cult act. Back in England, the situation could hardly have been more different. Motörhead were at the peak of their popularity in 1981, releasing a hit collaboration with the all-female group Girlschool entitled Headgirl and entering the charts at number one with their live album No Sleep \\'Til Hammersmith. Though the group was rising commercially, there was tension within the band, particularly between Clarke and Lemmy. Clarke left the band during the supporting tour for 1982\\'s Iron Fist, reportedly angered by Kilmister\\'s planned collaboration with Wendy O. Williams. Former Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson replaced Clarke.The new lineup released Another Perfect Day in the summer of 1983, which was a disappointment, only reaching number 20 in the U.K. Robertson left two months later, replaced by two guitarists: former Persian Risk member Phillip Campbell and Wurzel (born Michael Burston). Shortly afterward, Taylor left to join Robertson\\'s band Operator, and was replaced by former Saxon drummer Pete Gill. This lineup released a single, \"Killed by Death,\" in September of 1984, but shortly afterward the group left Bronze and the label filed an injunction against the band. As a result, Motörhead were prevented from releasing any recordings -- including a bizarre collaboration between Lemmy and page-three girl Samantha Fox -- for two years.Motörhead finally returned to action in 1986, first with a track on the charity compilation Hear \\'n Aid and later with the Bill Laswell-produced Orgasmatron, which was released on their new label, GWR. Orgasmatron was successful with the band\\'s still-dedicated cult audience in England and America, and received some of the group\\'s best reviews to date. The following year, they released Rock \\'N\\' Roll, which was equally successful. In 1988, the live No Sleep at All appeared, and Lemmy made his acting debut in the comedy Eat the Rich. Two years later, the band signed to WTG and released The Birthday Party. Taylor briefly rejoined the band in 1991, appearing on that year\\'s 1916, before Mikkey Dee, formerly of King Diamond, took over on drums. Dee\\'s first album with the band was 1992\\'s March or Die, which didn\\'t chart in the U.S. but played to their U.K. cult following. WTG dropped the band after the album\\'s release and they started their own label, appropriately called Motörhead, which was distributed through ZYX. Their first album for the label was 1994\\'s Bastards.For the remainder of the \\'90s, Motörhead concentrated on touring more than recording. Outside of the band, Lemmy appeared in insurance commercials in Britain. He also acted in Hellraiser 3 and had a cameo in the porn movie John Wayne Bobbit Uncut. In 1997, the group moved to the metal-oriented indie label Receiver and released Stone Dead Forever; the live Everything Louder Than Everyone Else followed in 1999, and a year later they returned with We Are Motörhead. Hammered appeared in 2002 and was followed by 2004\\'s Inferno. In 2005, the Sanctuary label reissued some of the band\\'s classic albums (Overkill, Ace of Spades, and Iron Fist) in two-CD deluxe editions. A collection of all-new material, Kiss of Death, arrived in 2006, followed by Motorizer in 2008. In 2010, Motörhead embarked on a 35th anniversary tour in support of their 20th studio album, The Wörld Is Yours, which was released under a new deal with German label UDR. After taking an enforced break in 2012 to allow Lemmy to recover from laryngitis, the band started writing for its next album. Decamping to NRG Studios in North Hollywood to work with producer Cameron Webb, they recorded Aftershock, one of their most aggressive albums in years, which was released in October 2013. However, while Motörhead\\'s fan base was as strong as ever, Lemmy was not -- years of drinking and smoking began to catch up with the group\\'s leader (by this time well into his mid-sixties). He struggled with heart problems and diabetes, and in 2013, the rocker was fitted with an internal defibrillator to regulate his heartbeat. A pair of European festival dates had to be canceled when Lemmy was diagnosed with a hematoma, and Motörhead were forced to cut their set short at the 2013 Wacken Open Air Festival when Lemmy lacked the strength to continue. The seemingly indestructible Lemmy finally made concessions to his health, giving up cigarettes and replacing bourbon and cola with wine and the occasional vodka; by the end of 2014, Motörhead were back in business. They resumed their busy touring schedule, and in early 2015 entered the studio to begin work on a new album. The finished product, titled XXX: Bad Magic, was released in late August 2015. Sadly, Lemmy\\'s health continued to decline, and the day after Christmas, he was diagnosed with cancer. He died two days later on December 28, 2015. The band\\'s last record turned out to be a recording of two typically blistering sold-out shows at Munich\\'s Zenith concert hall only a month prior to his death. The resulting live album, Clean Your Clock, was released in spring 2016 and was the 40-year-old band\\'s final offering, following their understandable decision not to continue without their much-loved frontman. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'A metal institution whose influence cannot be overstated, Black Sabbath pioneered the genre as they constructed the framework for subsequent subgenres within metal, with entire movements rising from blueprints laid out in single Sabbath songs. From the end of the \\'60s and throughout the entirety of the \\'70s, the band became legendary for the doomy chemistry between its players: Ozzy Osbourne\\'s primal vocals, Tony Iommi\\'s seismic riffing, Bill Ward\\'s bluntly powerful drumming, and Geezer Butler\\'s thunderous basslines all congealed into a sinister breed of hard rock and occult-fixated songcraft the world had never heard before. This untouchable original lineup was responsible for metal masterpieces like 1970\\'s Paranoid, but when they splintered in 1979, Black Sabbath soldiered on with a cast of various, different singers while Osbourne applied his prince of darkness persona to a successful solo career that would span decades. There were various reunions and partial re-formations of the first Black Sabbath lineup, aiming to recapture some of their early evil energy on later period outings like 2013\\'s 13.The band formed in 1968 under the ill-fitting name the Polka Tulk Blues Band -- Iommi and Ward, who had just left the pub-blues outfit Mythology, were looking to take the genre in a more robust direction. They enlisted the services of Butler and Osbourne, both of whom had played together in a group called Rare Breed, and by the end of the year they were operating under the moniker Earth. The transition from Earth to Black Sabbath took place the following year, after Osbourne and Butler penned a song that was inspired by the 1963 Boris Karloff horror film of the same name. The resulting \"Black Sabbath,\" a funereal slab of blast furnace-forged dread built around the augmented fourth/tritonic interval, better known as the devil\\'s interval, would serve as the opening volley on their explosive eponymous 1970 debut. Released on Vertigo Records, the more progressive subsidiary of Philips/Phonogram, the bulk of the Rodger Bain-produced LP was recorded in a single day. Only a handful of guitar overdubs -- Iommi\\'s signature sound was lent considerable gravitas by the fact that he tuned his guitar a half-step down to provide some slack for a pair of fingers that saw their tips removed in a factory accident -- along with the rain, thunder, and tolling bells that so effectively introduced the group to the world, would be added later. The record was released on Friday the 13th, which helped kick-start the band\\'s reputation for populating the fertile crime scene that is history with plenty of blood spatter. Flush with eventual genre classics like \"The Wizard,\" \"N.I.B.,\" and the aforementioned title cut, Black Sabbath was initially dismissed by critics -- retrospective reviews were far more reverent -- but it managed to reach the U.K. Top Ten and hold court for over a year on the U.S. Top 40, eventually going certified platinum. With the surprise success of Black Sabbath, the band wasted little time in getting back into the studio. Released just seven months after their debut, Paranoid, the very antithesis of the sophomore slump, would spawn two of their biggest singles in \"Iron Man\" and the nervy, hard-hitting title track, the latter of which would be the band\\'s only Top Ten hit -- the LP went straight to the top of the U.K. charts and sold over four-million copies in the U.S. Deeper yet no less immediate cuts like the air-raid siren-led, politically charged \"War Pigs\" and the trippy, mellow doom anthem \"Planet Caravan\" revealed a group that had far more creative gas in the tank than its detractors would have cared to admit. Paranoid also afforded Sabbath their first measure of controversy after an inquest was made regarding an American nurse who committed suicide while listening to the LP; for many, the name Black Sabbath would become synonymous with Satanism throughout the \\'70s and \\'80s. Sabbath continued to blow the unholy horn of plenty with albums three and four. Released in 1971, the brutish Master of Reality was certified double-platinum on the strength of fan favorites like \"Sweet Leaf,\" \"Children of the Grave,\" and \"Into the Void,\" the latter two of which saw Iommi downtune three semitones in order to release even more string tension -- Butler followed suit, and the deep earth pummeling that followed has been widely cited as the auger of sludge, doom, and stoner metal. The LP also featured the Iommi-composed/Butler-penned \"After Forever\" which, much to the confusion of some of the band\\'s more zealous critics, reflected the bass player\\'s deep Catholic faith. Vol. 4, recorded in Los Angeles, arrived the following year and was the first Sabbath outing without Rodger Bain handling production duties -- Iommi and then-manager Patrick Meehan would co-produce the album. Certainly the group\\'s most ambitious outing to date, Vol. 4 also represented Black Sabbath at their most chemically dependent -- the album\\'s working title was Snowblind -- shipping in speaker boxes filled with cocaine, and turning their rented Bel Air house into a boozy black cauldron of rock star excess. Nevertheless, they managed to stay just-in-control long enough to piece together a dark, introspective gem of a record that didn\\'t spawn any hits -- the caustic riff-gasm that is \"Supernaut\" must have charted in some other more forgiving dimension -- but still topped the album charts. Vol. 4 dutifully reflected Sabbath\\'s debauched collective headspace at the time, but retained enough of the blue-collar might that fueled their early works to connect. Arriving in 1973, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was another success, doubling down on the more progressive elements of Vol. 4, even going so far as to tap Rick Wakeman from Yes to contribute keyboards to the track \"Sabbra Cadabra.\" Bolstered by the now-iconic title cut as well as the punishing \"Killing Yourself to Live,\" the LP not only resonated with fans, but elicited positive comments from mainstream critics as well, becoming Sabbath\\'s fifth platinum album in the U.S. and earning their first silver certification in the U.K. Sabotage, released in 1975, saw the band returning to the bottom-heavy, molten-metal attack of their debut, for the most part dialing back on the orchestral flourishes and studio trickery of their last two outings. It also arrived in the midst of contentious litigation between the band and its now-former manager Meehan. Between the bruising \"Hole in the Sky,\" the angst-fueled \"Symptom of the Universe,\" and the nearly nine-minute epic \"The Writ,\" the band sounded both reinvigorated and wrecked, like a bloodied beast, filled with bullets, standing on the corpse of its captor. Fans and critics were kind, but the musical climate was changing both at home and abroad, and Black Sabbath were beginning to feel the chill.By 1976 the band was undergoing an internal struggle as well, having to contend with an increasingly frustrated and chemically dependent frontman who was looking to strike out on his own. Technical Ecstasy (1976) and Never Say Die! (1978), despite going gold, suffered beneath the weight of both the band\\'s substance abuse issues and its increasingly diminished position in popular music. Bands like the Clash and the Sex Pistols were on the rise, and Sabbath\\'s brand of stalwart heavy blues-rock was losing favor. During the recording of Never Say Die!, Osbourne quit, eventually making his way back into the fold during the final sessions, but in 1979, after touring in support of the album, he was fired from the group for good. Osbourne\\'s departure and successful solo career may have signaled the end of an era for the group, but Black Sabbath weren\\'t about to go gently into that good night. At the suggestion of the band\\'s new manager\\'s daughter Sharon Arden (later to become Sharon Osbourne), Iommi, Butler, and Ward brought in ex-Rainbow frontman Ronnie James Dio to take over vocal duties. Dio\\'s powerful voice, as idiosyncratic and iconic as Osbourne\\'s but with a far more wholesale appeal, proved the perfect fit for Black Sabbath 2.0. Released in 1980, Heaven and Hell was a critical and commercial success, becoming their third-highest-selling LP after Paranoid and Master of Reality. That same year, while on tour, Ward had reached the apex of his alcoholism and announced that he too was leaving the group. Vinny Appice, the younger brother of legendary Vanilla Fudge drummer Carmine Appice, was brought in to replace him, and would appear on the group\\'s tenth studio outing, 1981\\'s Mob Rules. The album received mixed reviews, but still managed to go gold in the U.S. and crack the U.K. Top 40 on the strength of the fiery title track, which also appeared -- in a different version -- in the cult animated, adult-fantasy film Heavy Metal. The band\\'s first-ever concert album, Live Evil, was released in 1983. Recorded during the group\\'s 1982 tour in support of Mob Rules, it presented an audio snapshot of the band at the peak of its technical powers, but failed to capture the internal tensions that were bubbling beneath all of the pick slides and pyrotechnics. Citing an irreconcilable falling out with Iommi and Butler, Dio and Appice left the group in the middle of mixing the album and formed their own band. With the newly minted Dio issuing Holy Diver and Osbourne dropping his third chart-topping solo LP, Bark at the Moon, Black Sabbath were at a definite crossroads. Undeterred, Iommi and Butler immediately began looking for new members with whom to start up the old machinery, eventually settling on Deep Purple\\'s Ian Gillan on vocals and a freshly sober Bill Ward behind the kit. While it sold well initially, the resulting Born Again was a critical failure, a tone-deaf collection of subpar Sabbath tropes that would ultimately leave Iommi the last man standing. Even the tour in support of the album was a disaster, with Ward, who relapsed during recording, being replaced by Move/ELO drummer Bev Bevan, and a cringe-inducing prop malfunction providing the inspiration for the 1984 mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap\\'s now-classic Stonehenge sequence. After the tour Bevan left, Gillan rejoined Deep Purple, and Butler went solo, leaving Iommi no choice but to put the band on hiatus. What followed was a long period of near-constant personnel changes, with Iommi remaining the sole original member. Issued in 1986, the bluesy Seventh Star was, for all intents and purposes, an Iommi solo album -- record company pressure forced him to add the Black Sabbath moniker to the front cover -- and 1987\\'s Eternal Idol was the first to feature new semi-permanent vocalist Tony Martin. Hard rock heavyweight drummer Cozy Powell joined Iommi and Martin on 1989\\'s Headless Cross and 1990\\'s Viking-themed concept album Tyr, but none of the initial post-Born Again LPs had much of an impact critically or commercially. Once again, the musical paradigm was shifting away from the hard rock/heavy metal genre, and Sabbath were just trying to stay afloat. The generally well-received Dehumanizer, a Heaven and Hell/Mob Rules-era reunion with Butler, Dio, and Vinny Appice, provided the Black Sabbath name with a much-needed shot in the arm in 1992, and managed to sneak them back into the Top 40 both at home and overseas, but it would prove to be a one-off affair. Arriving in 1994, Cross Purposes kept Butler on board and brought back Martin on vocals, but it failed to capitalize on any momentum left over from Dehumanizer\\'s success, and the following year\\'s disappointing Forbidden, the band\\'s 18th studio LP, would be the last outing for Martin, as well as the last studio album from the band for nearly 18 years. Iommi, Butler, Ward, and Osbourne would eventually make their way back under the stage lights in 1997, culminating in the release of the Best Metal Performance Grammy Award-winning double-live LP Reunion, but it would be 16 years -- and a whole lot of Ozzy, who was eventually given his own reality television show -- before the band would bring the dark arts back to the recording studio. Released in 2013, the Rick Rubin-produced 13, which also brought home a Grammy, this time for the single \"God Is Dead?,\" would be Black Sabbath\\'s final album, and in 2015, Osbourne, Iommi, and Butler (Ward refused to participate) announced that their upcoming world tour would be their last. The aptly named The End Tour, which concluded in their hometown of Birmingham, saw Black Sabbath closing the coffin lid on a nearly 50-year career and cementing their legacy as the unheralded harbingers of heavy, sludge, stoner, and doom metal. A concert LP/film of the performance was released in 2017. ~ James Christopher Monger &amp; Fred Thomas, Rovi'\n",

      "'One of the most influential heavy metal groups of all time, Judas Priest emerged at the dawn of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Decked out in leather and chains, the band combined the gothic doom of Black Sabbath and blazing speed of Led Zeppelin with the inventive art rock of Queen, powered by the dynamic banshee wail of Rob Halford and the vicious dual lead guitar attack of Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing. Judas Priest set the pace for the genre from 1975 until 1985 with iconic albums like British Steel (1980), Screaming for Vengeance (1982), and Defenders of the Faith (1984) and helped lay the groundwork for speed and death metal. The group struggled after Halford\\'s departure in the early \\'90s but were restored to prominence in the 2000s upon his return, issuing a string of acclaimed efforts -- Angel of Retribution (2005), Nostradamus (2010), Redeemer of Souls (2014), and Firepower (2018) -- that skillfully married melody, pageantry, and muscle. Formed in Birmingham, England, in 1970, the group\\'s core members were guitarist K.K. Downing and bassist Ian Hill. Joined by Alan Atkins and drummer John Ellis, the band played their first concert in 1971. Atkins\\' previous group was called Judas Priest, yet the members decided it was the best name for the new group. The band played numerous shows throughout 1971. During the year, Ellis was replaced by Alan Moore; by the end of the year, Chris Campbell replaced Moore. After a solid year of touring the U.K., Atkins and Campbell left the band in 1973 and were replaced by vocalist Rob Halford and drummer John Hinch. They continued touring, including a visit to Germany and the Netherlands in 1974. By the time the tour was completed, they had secured a record contract with Gull, an independent U.K. label. Before recording their debut album, Judas Priest added guitarist Glenn Tipton.Rocka Rolla was released in September 1974 to almost no attention. The following year, they gave a well-received performance at the Reading Festival and Hinch departed the band; he was replaced by Alan Moore. Later that year, the group released Sad Wings of Destiny, which earned some positive reviews. However, the lack of sales was putting the band in a dire financial situation, which was remedied by an international contract with CBS Records. Sin After Sin (1977) was the first album released under that contract; it was recorded with Simon Phillips, who replaced Moore. The record received positive reviews and the band departed for their first American tour, with Les Binks on drums.When they returned to England, Judas Priest recorded 1978\\'s Stained Class, the record that established them as an international force in metal. Along with 1979\\'s Hell Bent for Leather (Killing Machine in the U.K.), Stained Class defined the nascent New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. A significant number of bands adopted Priest\\'s leather-clad image and hard, driving sound, making their music harder, faster, and louder. After releasing Hell Bent for Leather, the band recorded the live album Unleashed in the East (1979) in Japan; it became their first platinum album in America. Les Binks left the band in 1979; he was replaced by former Trapeze drummer Dave Holland. Their next album, 1980\\'s British Steel, entered the British charts at number three, launched the hit singles \"Breaking the Law\" and \"Living After Midnight,\" and was their second American platinum record; Point of Entry, released the following year, was nearly as successful. At the beginning of the \\'80s, Judas Priest was a top concert attraction around the world, in addition to being a best-selling recording artist. Featuring the hit single \"You\\'ve Got Another Thing Comin\\',\" 1982\\'s Screaming for Vengeance marked the height of their popularity, peaking at number 17 in America and selling over a million copies. Two years later, Defenders of the Faith nearly matched its predecessor\\'s performance, yet metal tastes were beginning to change, as Metallica and other speed/thrash metal groups started to grow in popularity. That shift was evident on 1986\\'s Turbo, where Judas Priest seemed out of touch with current trends; nevertheless, the record sold over a million copies in America on the basis of name recognition alone. However, 1987\\'s Priest...Live! was their first album since Stained Class not to go gold. Ram It Down (1988) was a return to raw metal and returned the group to gold status. Dave Holland left after this record and was replaced by Scott Travis for 1990\\'s Painkiller. Like Ram It Down, Painkiller didn\\'t make an impact outside the band\\'s die-hard fans, yet the group were still a popular concert act.In the early \\'90s, Rob Halford began his own thrash band, Fight, and soon left Judas Priest. In 1996, following a solo album by Glenn Tipton, the band rebounded with a new young singer, Tim \"Ripper\" Owens (formerly a member of a Priest tribute band and of Winter\\'s Bane). They spent the next year recording Jugulator amidst much self-perpetuated hype concerning Priest\\'s return to their roots. The album debuted at number 82 on the Billboard album charts upon its release in late 1997. Halford had by then disbanded Fight following a decrease in interest and signed with Trent Reznor\\'s Nothing label with a new project, Two. In the meantime, the remaining members of Judas Priest forged on with \\'98 Live Meltdown, a live set recorded during their inaugural tour with Ripper on the mike. Around the same time, a movie was readying production to be based on Ripper\\'s rags-to-riches story of how he got to front his all-time favorite band. Although Priest was originally supposed to be involved with the film, they ultimately pulled out, but production went on anyway without the band\\'s blessing (the movie, Rock Star, was eventually released in the summer of 2001, starring Mark Wahlberg in the lead role). Rob Halford in the meantime disbanded Two after just a single album, 1997\\'s Voyeurs, and returned back to his metal roots with a quintet simply named Halford. The group issued their debut in 2000, Resurrection, following it with a worldwide tour that saw the new group open up Iron Maiden\\'s Brave New World U.S. tour and issue a live set one year later (which included a healthy helping of Priest classics) -- Live Insurrection.In 2001 the Ripper-led Priest released a new album, Demolition, and Priest\\'s entire back catalog for Columbia was reissued with remastered sound and bonus tracks. In 2003 the band -- including Halford -- collaborated on the liner notes and song selections for their mammoth career-encompassing box Metalogy, a collaboration that brought Halford back into the fold. Owens split from the group amicably in 2003, allowing the newly reunited heavy metal legends to plan their global live concert tour in 2004, with their 16th studio album, Angel of Retribution, to be released the following year. In 2008 the band released Nostradamus, a sprawling, two-disc conceptual piece that charted the life and times of the famous French seer. On December 7, 2010, Priest broke the news that their upcoming Epitaph world tour would be their last. The following month, however, they clarified that they were not disbanding, announcing that they were working on new material. Before the tour began, founding member Downing left the band over differences with the other members and their management; he was replaced by Richie Faulkner.Priest worked on their new album during the tour, which ran until 2012. The record\\'s release was delayed several times, but it was eventually announced that it would see the light of day in July 2014. Entitled Redeemer of Souls, it was described by Priest as a traditional, crowd-pleasing return to their roots, and went on to become the group\\'s first Top Ten album in the U.S., landing at the number six slot on the Billboard 200 chart. A lengthy tour followed, and in early 2016 Priest issued the concert album Battle Cry, which featured highlights from their August 1, 2015 performance at Germany\\'s Wacken Festival. Judas Priest began loosely demoing ideas for a studio album in 2016, but they didn\\'t enter the studio as a band until a year later. It wasn\\'t until January 2018 that they announced to the press and social media that they\\'d completed Firepower, their 18th studio album. They revisited their original, organic way of recording, with the entire band playing together at the same time in the studio. They underscored this by enlisting producers Tom Allom -- who worked on all of the band\\'s records from 1979 through 1988 -- and Grammy-winning veteran Andy Sneap. In a press release, Halford explained, \"Tom Allom has got this classic metal thing, and Andy is a bit more of a \\'modern metal producer\\',\" adding, \"I think to get this balance between that classic old-school metal to what Andy\\'s world is was just a remarkable coalescence.\"In January 2018, the band announced the March release of Firepower with a teaser video for the single \"Lightning Strikes\" and news of a forthcoming world tour. In February, guitarist Tipton -- diagnosed with Parkinson\\'s disease a decade earlier -- announced that it had progressed to the point where he had to retire from touring. Sneap would fill his slot on the road. Former guitarist K.K. Downing, who claimed he was shocked that he wasn\\'t asked to replace Tipton on tour, asserted in public that \"Sneap\\'s role was actually much more than as a producer on Firepower\" -- i.e., he actually played Tipton\\'s parts on the album. Halford took to the media to respond, saying that \"everything that you hear from Glenn on Firepower is the amazing Glenn Tipton.\" He called Downing\\'s accusation \"completely superfluous\" and \"a thousand percent false.\" On March 2, Judas Priest released the lyric video for second single \"Never the Heroes.\" Firepower was issued on March 9 and soared to number five in the U.K., making it their first Top Ten album there since British Steel. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'A product of New York City\\'s early \\'70s glam rock scene, Twisted Sister were eager students of the New York Dolls, with Kiss\\'s theatrics, Slade\\'s pop acumen, and the shock rock of Alice Cooper tossed in for good measure. Based out of Long Island and featuring the core lineup of guitarists Jay Jay French and Eddie \"Fingers\" Ojeda, vocalist Dee Snider, bassist Mark \"The Animal\" Mendoza, and drummer A.J. Pero, the group issued two critically acclaimed, under-the-radar efforts before breaking into the mainstream in 1984 with Stay Hungry. The LP went multi-platinum on the strength of the monster singles \"We\\'re Not Gonna Take It\" and \"I Wanna Rock.\" Twisted Sister released two more albums (Come Out and Play and Love Is for Suckers) before ceasing operations in 1988. They reformed in the early aughts and issued the holiday album Twisted Christmas in 2006 but disbanded again in 2016 following the death of A.J. Pero the year prior. Founded in 1972 by guitarist John Segal (aka Jay Jay French), Twisted Sister based their every move on the New York Dolls. Their apprenticeship on the local club scene was a slow one. Still, by late 1975, a somewhat stable lineup had coalesced around French, fellow guitarist and high-school buddy Eddie \"Fingers\" Ojeda, bassist Kenneth Harrison Neil, and drummer Kevin John Grace. Several different vocalists filed through their ranks, but it was only with the arrival of Dee Snider in early 1976 that the group found its true leader. Snider brought a strong Alice Cooper influence to the band, giving their glam-forward sound a welcome kick in the ass. He also quickly developed into their dominant songwriter, and with new drummer A.J. Pero in tow, Twisted Sister began making a name for themselves in and around N.Y.C. Arriving in 1983, the seminal You Can\\'t Stop Rock \\'n\\' Roll laid the groundwork for future endeavors. With its polished production values and more consistent material, the LP yielded only one chart-flirting single in the title track (for which the band filmed their first video) but garnered serious cred with the metal crowd. Later that year, L.A.\\'s Quiet Riot topped the charts with their smash hit Metal Health (the first heavy metal album to do so), and Twisted Sister took advantage of this sympathetic musical climate to unleash their definitive statement, 1984\\'s Stay Hungry. The album saw Snider dig deep into his pop, punk, and glam roots and infuse massive commercial appeal to the band\\'s hard rock onslaught. Bolstered by the anthemic singles \"We\\'re Not Gonna Take It\" and \"I Wanna Rock,\" Stay Hungry was certified platinum in five countries (triple platinum in the U.S. and quintuple platinum in Canada) and pushed Twisted Sister to the fore of the pop/hair metal scene. The songs\\' accompanying videos, which featured actor Mark Metcalf reprising his role as the hot-headed ROTC leader Douglas C. Neidermeyer from the movie National Lampoon\\'s Animal House, received heavy rotation on MTV. The extensive touring that followed guaranteed the album\\'s stay near the top of the charts for many months to come and, against all odds, helped make Twisted Sister into household names in America. 1985\\'s Come Out and Play received mixed reviews, attempting to cater to the band\\'s hardcore elements and newfound pop constituency while introducing an excessively glammed-up image makeover. Snider remained in the spotlight, appearing before a Senate committee later that year (along with Frank Zappa and John Denver) to testify against the Parents Music Resource Center\\'s demands for music censorship legislation. Drummer Pero had tendered his resignation at tour\\'s end, opening the door to a very troubled 1986 for Twisted Sister as rumors ran rampant about an irreparable rift between Snider and French over the band\\'s direction. They eventually re-emerged with 1987\\'s Love Is for Suckers, which commenced with the mighty \"Wake Up (The Sleeping Giant)\" and featured new drummer Joey \"Seven\" Franco. However, not even the services of pop-metal producer Beau Hill could save the album from disappointing sales, and Twisted Sister wound up disintegrating shortly thereafter.Dee Snider soldiered on with a new hard rock band named Desperado (later renamed Widowmaker and featuring guitarist Bernie Tormé and drummer Franco). Grunge came and went, and posthumous releases like 1992\\'s Big Hits and Nasty Cuts and 1994\\'s Live at Hammersmith provided glimpses into Twisted Sister\\'s meteoric flight across the hard rock firmament. As the \\'90s wore on, Snider transitioned into a widely syndicated radio DJ and even sometimes movie producer. He wrote and starred in the 1998 horror flick Strangeland, for which he also managed to reunite Twisted Sister\\'s final lineup to record a brand-new song entitled \"Heroes Are Hard to Find.\" His reconciliation with Twisted Sister founder Jay Jay French (who\\'d kept busy managing bands, most notably nu-metallers Sevendust) eventually paved the way for a reunion of the \"classic\" Stay Hungry lineup, which performed publicly for the first time in almost 15 years at a post-9/11 benefit concert for New York City. By then, Spitfire Records had reissued much of the group\\'s original catalog, along with a pair of Club Daze collections documenting their \"lost\" \\'70s recordings and, in 2004, a re-recorded Stay Hungry (retitled Still Hungry) to mark its 20th anniversary. This activity fostered further demand for a more permanent return to action, resulting in the release of 2006\\'s likable holiday effort, Twisted Christmas. The band continued to tour at home and abroad, performing to massive European festival audiences and releasing the occasional concert LP. In March 2015, the band announced that drummer A.J. Pero had passed away; he was 55 years old. Twisted Sister embarked on a proper farewell tour the following year, with Mike Portnoy filling in for Pero, and played their final show on November 12, 2016, in Monterrey. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia &amp; James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "'QUIET RIOT is a rock n roll phenomenon. Famously described as the first heavy metal band to top the pop chart at #1 on Billboard magazine, the Los Angeles quartet became an overnight sensation thanks to their monster 1983 smash album Metal Health.The story of QUIET RIOT begins in 1980 when Kevin DuBrow formed a new band under his own name, working with Frankie Banali and a variety of musicians over the next few years before signing with Pasha/CBS Records, reverting back to the QUIET RIOT moniker, and entering the studio with new guitarist Carlos Cavazo and bassist Chuck Wright. Chuck left the band mid-recording and was replaced by Rudy Sarzo. Driven by the irresistible double whammy of the title track and a raucous rendition of the old Slade song \"Cum on Feel the Noize,\" the album stormed up the U.S. charts, reaching the number one spot and going platinum five times over. Frankie Banali\\'s history with QUIET RIOT began in 1982 and he has the distinction of being the only member of QUIET RIOT to have recorded on every QUIET RIOT release from 1983\\'s Metal Health through 2006\\'s Rehab. After nearly three years since the loss of his friend and bandmate Kevin DuBrow, and with the blessings and support of Kevin DuBrow\\'s family, Frankie has decided to continue his journey and the musical legacy of QUIET RIOT along with bassist Chuck Wright, guitarist Alex Grossi. They are currently promoting their latest album, Hollywood Cowboys which they recorded with vocalist James Durbin.'\n",

      "\"Backyard barbeques, barroom brawls, tent revivals, and big rock festivals alike are suitable environments for the Red Dirt Metal of TEXAS HIPPIE COALITION, a band with a sound so devilishly electrifying that they had to come up with a new genre to describe it. BIG DAD RITCH captains this pirate ship of bikers, outlaws, troubadours, and hellraisers, welcoming all comers to the THC party with gregarious charisma and Southern charm. Across a half dozen albums, countless club gigs, and show stealing performances at Rockstar Mayhem, THC has spread the good word of big riffs, big hooks, and wild times. High in the Saddle is a record full of unashamed, full-throttle ass kicking. It's the band's second pairing with producer Bob Marlette (Black Stone Cherry, Rob Zombie) and sixth album over all, on the heels of the No. 2 Billboard Heatseekers slab, Dark Side of Black . Rock/metal tastemaker Loudwire.com described THC's “nonstop gritty, grooving, and downright party rock” as “sounding like the bastard that spawned from a threesome between Monster Magnet, Willie Nelson, and Pantera.” Guitarists Cord Pool and Nevada Romo, bassist Rado Romo, and drummer Devon Carothers build songs with traditional blue-collar and red-blooded American craftsmanship, skillfully transforming Big Dad Ritch's tales of recklessness and revelry into anthems for the Red Dirt Metal lifestyle.\"\n",

      "'The man (and the band) who first brought shock rock to the masses, Alice Cooper became one of the most successful and influential acts of the \\'70s with their gritty but anthemic hard rock and a live show that delivered a rock &amp; roll chamber of horrors, thrilling fans and cultivating outrage from authority figures (which made fans love them all the more). The name Alice Cooper originally referred to both the band and its lead singer (born Vincent Furnier), as they played dark, eccentric, psychedelic rock on their first two albums, Pretties for You (1969) and Easy Action (1970). After a spell in Detroit where they soaked up the high-energy influence of the Stooges and the MC5, Alice Cooper scored breakthrough hits in 1971 with \"I\\'m Eighteen\" and the album Love It to Death, in which the group finally stumbled upon the formula that made them stars, blending tough, dirty, guitar-fueled hard rock with Cooper\\'s sneering vocals and lyrics that were by turns relatable (\"I\\'m Eighteen,\" \"Body\") and willfully spooky (\"Black Juju,\" \"The Ballad of Dwight Frye\"). Coupled with a live show that included snakes, electric chairs, fake blood, and mock hangings, Alice Cooper had something to offend everyone, and from 1971\\'s Killer to 1973\\'s Billion Dollar Babies, they could seemingly do no wrong. Following the commercial and critical disappointment of 1973\\'s Muscle of Love, the Alice Cooper band broke up, and Alice went forward as a solo act, delivering a cleaner and more professional variation on the themes of his early \\'70s hits, while the band attempted to continue as Billion Dollar Babies, with little success. Cooper\\'s glossy 1975 solo debut, Welcome to My Nightmare, was a massive hit, and his shows became even more elaborate as he became a regular fixture on television, but subsequent solo releases saw his following dwindle until 1989\\'s Trash and 1991\\'s Hey Stoopid, where he blended his trademark sound with hair metal arrangements and production and gained a new audience. Cooper\\'s dedicated fan base kept him in the game long after his \\'70s peak, touring regularly and releasing albums like 2021\\'s high-spirited Detroit Stories and 2023\\'s tightly wound, live sounding set Road.Vincent Furnier formed his first group, the Earwigs, as an Arizona teenager in the early \\'60s. Changing the band\\'s name to the Spiders in 1965, the group was eventually called the Nazz (not to be confused with Todd Rundgren\\'s band of the same name). The Spiders and the Nazz both released local singles that were moderately popular. In 1968, after discovering there was another band with the same name, the group changed its name to Alice Cooper. According to band legend, the name came to Furnier during a Ouija board session, where he was told he was the reincarnation of a 17th century witch of the same name. Comprised of vocalist Furnier -- who would soon begin calling himself Alice Cooper -- guitarist Mike Bruce, guitarist Glen Buxton, bassist Dennis Dunaway, and drummer Neal Smith, the group moved to California in 1968. There they met Shep Gordon, who became their manager, and Frank Zappa, who signed Alice Cooper to his Straight Records imprint.Alice Cooper released their first album, Pretties for You, in 1969. Easy Action followed early in 1970, but failed to chart. The group\\'s reputation in Los Angeles was slowly shrinking, so the band moved to Furnier\\'s hometown of Detroit. For the next year, the group refined their bizarre stage show. Late in 1970, the group\\'s contract was transferred to Straight\\'s distributor Warner Bros., and they began recording their third album with producer Bob Ezrin. With Ezrin\\'s assistance, Alice Cooper developed their classic heavy metal crunch on 1971\\'s Love It to Death, which featured the number 21 hit single \"Eighteen\"; the album peaked at number 35 and went gold. The success enabled the group to develop a more impressive, elaborate live show, which made them a highly popular concert attraction across the U.S. and eventually the U.K. Killer, released late in 1971, was another gold album. Released in the summer of 1972, School\\'s Out was Alice Cooper\\'s breakthrough record, peaking at number two and selling over a million copies. The title song became a Top Ten hit in the U.S. and a number one single in the U.K. Billion Dollar Babies, released the following year, was the group\\'s biggest hit, reaching number one in both America and Britain; the album\\'s first single, \"No More Mr. Nice Guy,\" became a Top Ten hit in Britain, peaking at number 25 in the U.S. Muscle of Love appeared late in 1973, yet it failed to capitalize on the success of Billion Dollar Babies. After Muscle of Love, Furnier and the rest of Alice Cooper parted ways to pursue other projects. Having officially changed his name to Alice Cooper, Furnier embarked on a similarly theatrical solo career; the rest of the band released one unsuccessful album under the name Billion Dollar Babies, while Mike Bruce and Neal Smith both recorded solo albums that were never issued. In the fall of 1974, a compilation of Alice Cooper\\'s five Warner albums, entitled Alice Cooper\\'s Greatest Hits, became a Top Ten hit. For his first solo album, Welcome to My Nightmare, Cooper hired Lou Reed\\'s backing band from Rock \\'N\\' Roll Animal -- guitarists Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter, bassist Prakash John, keyboardist Joseph Chrowski, and drummer Penti Glan -- as his supporting group. Released in the spring of 1975, the record was similar to his previous work and became a Top Ten hit in America, launching the hit acoustic ballad \"Only Women Bleed.\" Its success put an end to any idea of reconvening Alice Cooper the band. Its follow-up, 1976\\'s Alice Cooper Goes to Hell, was another hit, going gold in the U.S. After that album, Cooper\\'s career began to slip, partially due to changing trends and partially due to his alcoholism. Cooper entered rehab in 1978, writing an album about his treatment called From the Inside (1978) with Bernie Taupin, Elton John\\'s lyricist. During the early \\'80s, Cooper continued to release albums and tour, yet he was no longer as popular as he was during his early-\\'70s heyday.Cooper made a successful comeback in the late \\'80s, sparked by his appearances in horror films and a series of pop-metal bands that paid musical homage to his classic early records and concerts. Constrictor, released in 1986, started his comeback, but it was 1989\\'s Trash that returned Cooper to the spotlight. Produced by the proven hitmaker Desmond Child, Trash featured guest appearances by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and most of Aerosmith; the record became a Top Ten hit in Britain and peaked at number 20 in the U.S., going platinum. \"Poison,\" a midtempo rocker featured on the album, became Cooper\\'s first Top Ten single since 1977. After the release of Trash, he continued to star in the occasional film, tour, and record, although he wasn\\'t able to retain the audience he\\'d recaptured with Trash. Still, 1991\\'s Hey Stoopid and 1994\\'s The Last Temptation were generally solid, professional efforts that helped Cooper settle into a comfortable cult status without damaging the critical goodwill surrounding his \\'70s output. After a live album, 1997\\'s Fistful of Alice, Cooper returned on the smaller Spitfire label in 2000 with Brutal Planet, and Dragontown a year later. The Eyes of Alice Cooper appeared in 2003 and found Cooper and company playing a more stripped-down brand of near-garage rock. Dirty Diamonds from 2005 was nearly as raw and hit the streets around the same time Cooper premiered his syndicated radio show Nights with Alice Cooper. Three years later he returned with Along Came a Spider, a concept album that told the story of a spider-obsessed serial killer. In 2010, he released the live album Theatre of Death, along with a download-only EP of redone Cooper classics titled Alice Does Alice. 2011\\'s Welcome 2 My Nightmare, a sequel to his 1975 conceptual classic of the same name (minus the 2), was recorded with longtime co-conspirator Bob Ezrin, and featured 14 brand-new cuts that spanned multiple genres and relied on the talents of a host of previous members of the Alice Cooper band (including Steve Hunter), as well as a guest spot from pop superstar Ke$ha. The same year, he was awarded the Kerrang! Icon Award.Advancing years didn\\'t prevent Cooper from maintaining a hectic schedule, and by 2012 he was touring with Iron Maiden and headlining Bloodstock Open Air. Aside from his musical pursuits, he also starred in Tim Burton\\'s adaptation of Dark Shadows, playing himself alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Johnny Depp, and Michelle Pfeiffer. He returned to touring in 2014 as the opening act for Mötley Crüe\\'s final tour, and the following year he unveiled a new supergroup called Hollywood Vampires, which included Johnny Depp and Joe Perry. They subsequently released an album of rock covers. He reunited with Ezrin yet again for his 27th studio record. Paranormal was released in 2017, featuring contributions from ZZ Top\\'s Billy Gibbons, Deep Purple\\'s Roger Glover, and U2\\'s Larry Mullen, alongside original bandmembers Smith, Dunaway, and Bruce. The album was also released in a special edition with a bonus disc of live material. Early the following year, an EP was released, centered around Paranormal single \"The Sound of A,\" which included a handful of live cuts from his 2017 tour. In August 2018, Cooper released A Paranormal Evening at the Olympia Paris, a live album drawn from his European tour in support of the Paranormal album. A 2019 EP, Breadcrumbs, saw Cooper paying tribute to his hometown of Detroit with songs written about his early garage rock heroes. He continued the Detroit homage on his next full length, 2021\\'s Detroit Stories. In addition to many new songs of his own, the album included covers of Bob Seger, Detroit indie mainstays Outrageous Cherry, and the Velvet Underground\\'s \"Rock &amp; Roll\" presented in the style of Mitch Ryder &amp; The Detroit Wheels\\' 1971 rendition. The LP peaked at number 47 on the Billboard 200 and at number seven on the Top Independent Albums chart. The following year saw the release of the concert album Detroit Stories/Paranormal/A Paranormal Evening with Alice Cooper at The Olympia, Paris. In August of 2023, Cooper released a new album, Road. This set of new, guitar-heavy tunes sought to capture the power his band had in an on-stage setting. In addition to the album\\'s live sound, Road was held together by the loose conceptual theme of situations unique to the rock and roll touring life. The album came out concurrently with a tour Cooper was booked for supporting Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard, and he had plans for a co-headlining tour with Rob Zombie later in the year. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

The band pioneered a union of thrashed-out European guitar pyrotechnics, East Coast hardcore spirit, on-stage hijinks, and enlightened lyricism that set the pace for what the turn-of-the-century deemed heavy. 2002's Alive Or Just Breathing became avowed as a definitive album, being named among “The Top 100 Greatest Metal Albums of the Decade” by Decibel and celebrated by everyone from Metal Hammer to Revolver. They also garnered two GRAMMY Award nominations in the category of “Best Metal Performance” in 2005 and 2014 and gold certifications for The End of Heartache [2004] and As Daylight Dies [2006]. The group landed three consecutive Top 10 debuts on the Billboard Top 200 with Killswitch Engage [2009], Disarm The Descent [2013], and their career high best bow at #6 with Incarnate [2016]. The latter two releases would also both capture #1 on the Top Rock Albums and Top Hard Rock Albums charts. Their total streams have exceeded half-a-billion to date.2019 represents another turning point.

      "'In a decade fueled by party anthems and power ballads, Poison enjoyed a great amount of popularity, with only Bon Jovi and Def Leppard outselling them. While the group had a long string of pop-metal hits, they soon became just as renowned for their stage show, and continued to be a major attraction long after the \\'80s came to a close (bringing the commercial downfall of pop-metal with it). Meanwhile, frontman Bret Michaels reinvented himself as a reality TV star in 2007, and his involvement in several TV shows -- particularly Rock of Love, Celebrity Apprentice, and Life as I Know It -- helped maintain the band\\'s popularity in concert.Formerly known as Paris, Poison was formed in 1984 by Bret Michaels, bassist Bobby Dall, and drummer Rikki Rockett. After leaving their hometown of Harrisburg, PA, and resettling in L.A., the boys began holding auditions for a fourth member. Guitarist C.C. Deville got the gig, famously beating out future Guns N\\' Roses bandmate Slash in the process. With their lineup intact, Poison embraced a glammy, androgynous image and began playing shows in L.A., becoming masters of self-promotion and D.I.Y. advertising in the process. The hard work won them a contract with Enigma Records in 1986, and they released their first album, Look What the Cat Dragged In, that summer. The record spawned a pair of Top 40 hits, \"Talk Dirty to Me\" and \"I Won\\'t Forget You,\" and sold over two-million copies within a year of its release. The band was already quite popular by the end of 1987, but 1988\\'s Open Up &amp; Say...Ahhh! proved to be Poison\\'s commercial breakthrough, due to the massive hits \"Fallen Angel,\" \"Nothin\\' But a Good Time,\" and \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\" (which became the band\\'s first chart-topping single). After a prosperous tour alongside David Lee Roth, the group returned to the studio to record Flesh and Blood in 1990. The album, which included the number three hit \"Unskinny Bop\" and the number four ballad \"Something to Believe In,\" was another multi-platinum success, but it also signaled the end of Poison\\'s glory days. While touring in support of Flesh and Blood (as documented on the double-disc concert album Swallow This Live), the band began falling apart, and an infamous appearance on MTV showed Deville performing \"Talk Dirty to Me\" with his guitar unplugged. The band broke into a brawl backstage after the disastrous performance.Shortly after the release of Swallow This Live, Poison fired Deville due to his increasing addiction to drugs and alcohol. His replacement, 21 year-old Richie Kotzen, made his commercial debut with the band on 1993\\'s Native Tongue. Despite some strong reviews and a hit single, \"Stand,\" the album proved to be a commercial disappointment. Kotzen was fired during the subsequent tour, having reportedly struck up an illicit relationship with Rikki Rockett\\'s fiancé, and solo artist/session guitarist Blues Saraceno became Poison\\'s third guitarist. The band recorded its fifth studio album, Crack a Smile, for an intended release in 1996, but the record was shelved and replaced with the Greatest Hits: 1986-1996 disc instead. Toward the end of that year, Saraceno left and Deville returned to the band, a move that resulted in a successful reunion tour during the summer of 1999. The Crack a Smile sessions were finally released the following spring, followed by Power to the People, which paired five new songs with 12 live tracks from the band\\'s comeback tour. However, another tour was cut short by an accident that left Dall with serious back surgery.Following Dall\\'s lengthy recovery, the band stepped into the studio and recorded Hollyweird, which was released in the summer of 2002. The following tour was promoted as a nostalgic experience and was funded by VH1, laying the brickwork for a lucrative relationship between the band and the television channel. Deville would later appear in the network\\'s sixth season of The Surreal Life, while Michaels was awarded his own dating show, Rock of Love with Bret Michaels. Hollyweird\\'s reception was lukewarm at best, and Poison spent some time out of the spotlight while Michaels and Rockett released solo albums. They reconvened in 2006, celebrating their 20th anniversary with a nationwide tour and another greatest-hits album. Propelled by Michaels\\' new status as a reality TV star, The Best of Poison: 20 Years of Rock debuted inside the Billboard Top 20, a feat the band hadn\\'t accomplished since Native Tongue. The following year brought similar luck, with the band\\'s seventh studio effort -- a covers album titled Poison\\'d! -- moving over 20,000 units during its first week. ~ Barry Weber &amp; Andrew Leahey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Godsmack has more Top 10 Rock Songs than Foo Fighters or their hometown heroes, Aerosmith. Stretching back to their four-times platinum self-titled debut, initially recorded in 1996 for $2500, the veteran band's catalog of hits is enough to fill a marathon set without running out. Songs like “I Stand Alone,” “Awake,” and “Voodoo” are certified anthems deeply encoded into hard rock's DNA. Like the antiheroes of a heist movie planning one last score, the Lawrence, Massachusetts-bred quartet takes a victory lap with Lighting Up the Sky, dropping one more classic album as they ascend into the celebratory portion of their career. Sully Erna, Robbie Merrill, Tony Rombola, and Shannon Larkin climbed the creative mountain over and over. They are consummate rock fans themselves, so they refuse to finish as one of those bands where fans hit the beer line during “the new stuff”.Lighting Up the Sky is undoubtedly a stunning swan song, should it truly prove to be the final studio album of new music from Godsmack. “Surrender,” the first new song in four years, earned well over a half million streams on Spotify alone in its first two weeks of release. Songs like “What About Me” and “Soul On Fire” stand up to anything in the band's rich multi-platinum catalog. “Lighting Up the Sky is packed with melodies”, assures the frontman. The band's body of work includes eight albums, four Grammy nominations, two iHeartRadio Music Awards noms, and a Billboard Music Award. (more at Godsmack.com)\"\n",

      "'With their fusion of heavy metal, funk, hip-hop, and progressive rock, Faith No More have earned a substantial cult following. By the time they recorded their first album in 1985, the band had already had a string of lead vocalists, including Courtney Love; their debut, We Care a Lot, featured Chuck Mosley\\'s abrasive vocals but was driven by Jim Martin\\'s metallic guitar. Faith No More\\'s next album, 1987\\'s Introduce Yourself, was a more cohesive and impressive effort; for the first time, the rap and metal elements didn\\'t sound like they were fighting each other.In 1988, the rest of the band fired Mosley; he was replaced by Bay Area vocalist Mike Patton during the recording of their next album, The Real Thing. Patton was a more accomplished vocalist, able to change effortlessly between rapping and singing, as well as adding a considerably more bizarre slant to the lyrics. Besides adding a new vocalist, the band had tightened its attack and the result was the genre-bending hit single \"Epic,\" which established them as a major hard rock act.Following up the hit wasn\\'t as easy, however. Faith No More followed their breakthrough success with 1992\\'s Angel Dust, one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label. Although it sold respectably, it didn\\'t have the crossover potential of the first album. When the band toured in support of the album, tensions between the band and Martin began to escalate; rumors that his guitar was stripped from some of the final mixes of Angel Dust began to circulate. As the band was recording its fifth album in early 1994, it was confirmed that Martin had been fired from the band.Faith No More recorded King for a Day, Fool for a Lifetime with Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. During tour preparations he was replaced by Dean Menta. Menta only lasted for the length of the King for a Day tour and was replaced by Jon Hudson for 1997\\'s Album of the Year. Upon the conclusion of the album\\'s supporting tour, Faith No More announced they were disbanding in April 1998. Patton, who had previously fronted Mr. Bungle and had avant-garde projects with John Zorn, formed a new band named Fantômas with Melvins guitarist Buzz Osbourne, Mr. Bungle bassist Trevor Dunn, and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. Roddy Bottum continued with his band Imperial Teen, who released their first album, Seasick, in 1996. A posthumous Faith No More retrospective, Who Cares a Lot, appeared in late 1998. In 2009, after 11 years of dissolution, Faith No More staged a reunion tour, playing festivals in Europe and scattered American dates; Jim Martin did not participate, but Jon Hudson and the rest of the band\\'s 1988 lineup took part. As the band continued to play shows, speculation grew concerning the possibility of a new studio album, and in November 2014, the band confirmed the rumors with the release of a single, \"Motherfucker,\" titled with their typical cheek. In May 2015, Faith No More released their first album since 1997, Sol Invictus, through Reclamation Records, a label distributed by Patton\\'s Ipecac imprint; the band supported the release with an extensive tour of the United States, Europe, and South America. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Tool established themselves as one of America\\'s most enduring and unpredictable acts with an ever-evolving brand of muscular but mind-altering sonics, a wry sense of humor, and a mystical aesthetic that attracted a cult-like following of devoted fans with just a handful of albums spread across decades. Their greatest breakthrough was to meld dark underground metal with the ambition of art rock, crafting multi-sectioned, layered songs as if they were classical composers. While embracing the artsy, they also paid musical homage to the relentlessly bleak visions of grindcore, death metal, and thrash. Even with their post-punk influences, they executed their music with the sound and feel of prog rock, alternating between long, detailed instrumental interludes and lyrical rants in their songs. Debuting in the early \\'90s with Undertow, they were initially lumped in with the nu-metal contemporaries of the time, which made them a hit on rock radio with their sophomore effort, 1996\\'s Ænima. However, they soon broke away from those associations, evolving beyond the confines of traditional song structures and song lengths, crafting epics that often clocked in past the ten-minute mark on LP head-trips Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days (2006). After a lengthy 13-year hiatus, they returned to the fold in 2019 with their fifth opus, the chart-topping, Grammy-nominated Fear Inoculum. In 2022, they celebrated their 30th anniversary with \"Opiate²,\" a re-recorded version of their debut single.Formed in Los Angeles by percussionist Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, vocalist Maynard James Keenan, and original bassist Paul D\\'Amour, Tool had a knack for conveying the strangled, oppressive angst that the alternative nation of the early \\'90s claimed as its own, which helped them slip into the scene during the post-Nirvana era. Buffered by a prime slot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993, their debut full-length album, Undertow (Zoo Entertainment), rocketed to platinum status. Fervor for the band even resurrected their first effort, 1992\\'s Opiate EP, on the Billboard charts. While they were in the studio recording a follow-up, D\\'Amour amicably parted ways with Tool and his spot was filled by Justin Chancellor. By the time the fresh quartet delivered their sophomore album, Ænima, in late 1996, the alternative rock mainstream was ready. The album shot to number two on the Billboard charts and was certified multi-platinum in less than a decade. Singles \"Stinkfist,\" \"Forty Six &amp; 2,\" and the Grammy-winning title track were all Top Ten hits on the U.S. Rock chart, boosted by the twisted and often disturbing music videos created by Jones. After a co-headlining slot with Korn on Lollapalooza \\'97, Tool remained on the road, supporting Ænima into the next year. As nu-metal established its mainstream dominance at the close of the decade, Tool returned to the shadows. During their hiatus, Keenan formed a side project with former Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel. A Perfect Circle debuted in 2000, and their album Mer de Noms was a surprise hit. Their ensuing tour was a sold-out success as well, which only served to fuel Tool breakup rumors. To quell the speculation, they issued the stopgap B-sides/DVD set Salival late the same year. Meanwhile, in the studio, the band continued to journey down a new path that further distanced them from the mainstream. Delving deeper into their own mythos, songs grew longer, lyrics more inscrutable, and artwork increasingly psychedelic. Though they retained their pummeling, metal-oriented base, the quartet smashed the formula by further experimenting with complex time signatures, expansive atmospherics, and a classical approach to song compositions. The first taste of 21st century Tool arrived in January 2001 with the Grammy-winning single, \"Schism,\" which was also their first song to chart on the Hot 100. Lateralus (Volcano) arrived that May, topping the Billboard 200. Subsequent singles \"Parabola\" and \"Lateralus\" were favorites on the U.S. Rock charts, and the album soon went multi-platinum.After another several-year sabbatical -- during which time Keenan bounced back to A Perfect Circle -- the group returned with another chart-topper, 2006\\'s 10,000 Days. Their most esoteric statement yet, the album spawned the singles \"Vicarious,\" \"Jambi,\" and U.S. Mainstream Rock number one \"The Pot.\" Although it was also the band\\'s lowest-selling effort to date, the record still managed to win the group their third Grammy Award for Best Recording Package. At the conclusion of touring, Tool began another extended hiatus. Although the band re-emerged for a brief summer tour in 2009, it would be another ten years before fans could hear new music. During this period, Keenan debuted his de facto solo project, Puscifer, and returned for a third album with A Perfect Circle. Behind the scenes, the band was also bogged down by a lawsuit that wouldn\\'t be resolved until 2015. The next year, shaking off the cobwebs, Tool returned to the road for another quick jaunt in the U.S., kicking off another cycle of speculation from fans starved for new material.After an interminable 13-year gap between albums, Tool returned in 2019 with their epic fifth album, Fear Inoculum. Their third straight chart-topper, the set also featured their second Hot 100 placement to date, the ten-minute title track, which became the longest song to ever appear on that chart. Meanwhile, for the first time, Tool made their entire discography available for streaming; this propelled all of their past albums back to the charts, breaking records in the process. They embarked on a sold-out arena tour of the U.S. alongside Killing Joke and capped their successful comeback with a pair of Grammy nominations for \"7empest\" and \"Fear Inoculum.\" The former track scored them a Grammy in 2020 for Best Metal Performance. In March 2022, they released \"Opiate²,\" a re-recorded version of their 1991 single \"Opiate,\" issued to mark the 30th anniversary of their debut EP. ~ Neil Z.

      "'For metalheads who thought bands like W.A.S.P. and Mötley Crüe just weren\\'t menacing or heavy enough, White Zombie was the perfect antidote for a period of time during the mid- to late \\'90s, fusing B-horror movie visuals and subject matter with heavy music and growled vocals. And while White Zombie was originally thought to be a full-fledged band, it would later become known that the group was almost entirely the vision of its larger-than-life singer, Rob Zombie. Hence, the White Zombie story begins with good ol\\' Rob (who was then known as Rob Cummings), shortly after he relocated from his hometown of Haverhill, Massachusetts to New York City during the early \\'80s. Although he had long admired such theatrical metallists as Kiss and Alice Cooper (as well as such punk outfits as the Ramones), Rob wasn\\'t quick to form a group in the Big Apple; instead, he worked as a production assistant on the TV show Pee Wee\\'s Playhouse and did art design for magazines. By 1985, however, Rob opted to pursue a career in music and united with then-girlfriend/bassist Sean Yseult and formed White Zombie (titled after the 1932 Bela Lugosi flick). First considered a New York Underground band rather than a heavy metal band (as proven by such early admirers as Thurston Moore and Kurt Cobain), the group issued several indie releases -- 1985\\'s Gods of Voodoo Moon, 1986\\'s Pig Heaven and Psycho-Head Blowout, 1987\\'s Soul Crusher, plus 1989\\'s Make Them Die Slowly -- even though guitarists and drummers came and went on a steady basis (a few skinsmen who occupied the slot over the years have included Ivan DePrume and John Tempesta, among others). White Zombie finally found a permanent guitarist in ex-Rights of the Accused member J. (real name -- Jay Noel Yuenger), whose metallic riffs helped toughen up the band\\'s sound even further -- inching closer to a heavy metal band more than ever before (as evidenced by the first release with J., an EP that featured a cover of Kiss\\' \"God of Thunder\"). Around this time White Zombie also began incorporating industrial rock elements into its sound, which made it one of the few hard rock bands of the era that you could also dance to. Sensing that the group was about to rocket straight out of the underground scene, Geffen Records signed White Zombie and issued the band\\'s major-label debut, La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1, in early 1992. Although the world was going gaga over the sound of Seattle rock at the time, hard touring and support of their trashy video for \"Thunder Kiss \\'65\" from MTV (via the animated comedy show Beavis and Butthead) made the album a late-blooming success, as it hit the Top 30 a year after its release. It took the group an extended period to work up a worthy follow-up to La Sexorcisto, which eventually arrived in 1995: Astro-Creep: 2000 -- Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head. Spawning another big rock radio/MTV favorite with \"More Human Than Human,\" Astro-Creep: 2000 became White Zombie\\'s all-time highest charting album, peaking at number six on the U.S. Billboard charts. But the album\\'s success couldn\\'t hide the fact that Rob Zombie was getting fed up with the group and longed to launch a solo career of his own. So after the album\\'s supporting tour wrapped up and a remix album was issued, 1996\\'s Supersexy Swingin\\' Sounds, White Zombie split up. Subsequently, Rob Zombie has gone on to issue such hit solo albums as 1998\\'s Hellbilly Deluxe, 1999\\'s American Made Music to Strip By, and 2001\\'s The Sinister Urge (and even wrote and directed his own horror movie, House of 1000 Corpses), while Yseult formed the campy surf rock trio Famous Monsters, which released 1998\\'s In the Night!!! and 1999\\'s Around the World in 80 Bikinis. During the 21st century, Rob Zombie continued to pursue his horror-rock inclinations, but in 2016 Numero Group celebrated the early years of White Zombie with the box set It Came from N.Y.C., which chronicled all of the group\\'s 80s indie records. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'Finland\\'s Nightwish are an award-winning, best-selling symphonic metal band fronted by Floor Jansen, their third female vocalist. They\\'re the most successful Finnish band worldwide, selling more than nine million records and netting more than 60 gold and platinum awards, including five number one albums and 13 chart-topping singles. While they\\'re hardly the first goth-influenced metallers with a woman up front -- the Gathering from the Netherlands, Italy\\'s Lacuna Coil, and Sweden\\'s Therion all preceded them -- their rich melodicism, dynamic textures, and theatrical approach to performance make them a unique musical entity with global appeal. By the time they issued their second album, 1998\\'s Oceanborn, featuring the operatically trained vocalist Tarja Turunen, they had begun filling concert halls and small sports arenas across Europe. Once, released in 2004, put them at the peak of early commercial success, but Nightwish parted ways with Turunen after the tour. (She went on to have a successful solo career.) In 2007, Anette Olzon was chosen as her replacement, and her debut with the band, Dark Passion Play, went multi-platinum and the subsequent tour lasted nearly two years. Olzon also sang on 2012\\'s conceptual outing Imaginaerum before leaving Nightwish while on tour. Dutch soprano Floor Jansen (After Forever, ReVamp) was hired to complete the remaining dates and fit in so well with the group and fans that she was asked to join formally. Her first studio album was 2015\\'s Endless Forms Most Beautiful.Nightwish was founded in 1996 by keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen. Initially attempting to create acoustic music, he recruited trained opera vocalist Tarja Turunen, but soon added full metal band instrumentation with guitarist Emppo Vuorinen, bassist Sami Vänskä, and drummer Jukka Nevalainen. Nightwish\\'s demos landed them a contract with the Finnish label Spinefarm, which released their debut album, Angels Fall First, in late 1997 (it appeared in the rest of Europe the following year). The follow-up, Oceanborn, appeared in late 1998 and made Nightwish a bona fide mainstream success in their homeland; the album reached the Finnish Top Five and spun off three Top Ten singles. Nightwish toured Europe heavily, consolidating their success, and in 2000 recorded their third album, Wishmaster. Not only did it top the Finnish charts, but it also became the group\\'s first album to be released in the U.S. (by Century Media, which reissued their previous albums in 2001 as well). Released in 2002, Century Child proved a massive hit in Finland and around Europe, but 2004\\'s Once saw them go one step further and conquer Europe. Number one in Germany and number one in the European Top 100, Once\\'s success was the product of a band at the top of its game following years of hard work. Marco Hietala was now on bass, replacing Sami Vänskä, while in 2005 Swedish singer Anette Olzon replaced Tarja Turunen, who was fired for personal reasons. Dark Passion Play (2007) and the concept album Imaginaerum (2011) both featured Olzon before she and the band parted ways in 2012, halfway through their world tour. On short notice, ex-After Forever frontwoman Floor Jansen stepped in to take over lead vocal duties; the immense pressures on her were later revealed in the behind-the-scenes film Please Learn the Setlist in 48 Hours. Jansen\\'s powerful voice was a perfect fit for Nightwish. She was embraced immediately by their passionate fans and was soon made a permanent member, alongside English piper Troy Donockley. Nightwish\\'s first commercial release with Jansen was 2013\\'s live album Showtime, Storytime, which documented their triumphant show at that year\\'s Wacken Open Air metal festival in front of an 85,000-strong crowd. Endless Forms Most Beautiful, the group\\'s eighth studio album and first with Jansen on board, followed in early 2015. The set placed on no less than ten different charts including the Top 200 (number 34) and hard rock charts (number two). It was supported by a lavish multimedia touring extravaganza over the following 18 months. Two concerts at Wembley Stadium (which featured an on-stage appearance from scientist Richard Dawkins) and Ratina Stadion in Finland were produced as a deluxe two-disc video package titled Vehicle of Spirit, issued in December 2016. A separate audio soundtrack was also released.The band took an extended break in preparation for activities to celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2018. Holopainen formed the folk-influenced trio Auri with his wife, singer and violinist Johanna Kurkela, and Donockley. They released their eponymous debut in 2017. Nightwish\\'s next release was Decades, a double-length collection compiled from eight studio albums and, as a bonus, including their very first demo. The album was released in March of 2018 and coincided with Nightwish\\'s 20th anniversary world tour, which produced the live album Decades Live in Buenos Aires. In July of 2019, drummer Jukka Nevalainen stepped away as the band\\'s drummer and Kai Hahto was named his replacement. Nevalainen explained that he would continue taking care of band-related business behind the scenes. Nightwish issued their ninth studio outing, Human. :||: Nature., in 2020. A double-length recording, the first half contained nine unreleased songs, while side two offered the conceptual suite (divided into eight parts) entitled \"All the Works of Nature Which Adorn the World.\" Recorded between August and October of 2019 at four studios, it was mixed by Mikko Karmila and mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studio. 2021 brought a remastered and expanded edition of their most popular album, Once, featuring bonus instrumental, demo, and live tracks, and 2023 saw the first full physical audio release (on Svart) of their 2001 live album From Wishes to Eternity, originally released in a limited edition in Finland only and later on CD and DVD. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "'Slayer were one of the most distinctive, influential, and extreme thrash metal bands of the 1980s. Their graphic lyrics dealt with everything from death and dismemberment to war and the horrors of hell. Their full-throttle velocity, wildly chaotic guitar solos, and powerful musical chops painted an effectively chilling sonic background for their obsessive chronicling of the dark side; this correspondence helped Slayer\\'s music arguably hold up better than the remaining Big Three \\'80s thrash outfits (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax). Naturally, Slayer stirred up quite a bit of controversy over the years, with rumors flying about Satanism and Nazism that only added to their mystique. The band put out some undisputed classic albums (Reign in Blood, Hell Awaits, Seasons in the Abyss), and saw the number of naysayers and detractors shrink as their impact on the growing death metal scene was gradually and respectfully acknowledged. Slayer survived with the most vitality and the least compromise of any pre-Nirvana metal band, and their intensity inspired similar responses from their devoted fans. The band officially ceased operations in 2019. Slayer were formed in 1982 in Huntington Park, California, by guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman; also recruited were bassist/vocalist Tom Araya and drummer Dave Lombardo. They started out playing covers of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden songs, but quickly discovered that they could get attention (and fans) by exploiting threatening, Satanic imagery. The band was invited by Metal Blade\\'s Brian Slagel to contribute a track to the Metal Massacre, Vol. 3 compilation (a series that also saw the vinyl debuts of Metallica and Voivod); a contract and debut album, Show No Mercy, followed shortly thereafter. While Slayer\\'s early approach was rather cartoonish, their breakneck speed and instrumental prowess were still highly evident. Two EPs, Haunting the Chapel and Live Undead, were released in 1984, but 1985\\'s Hell Awaits refined their lyrical obsessions into a sort of concept album about damnation and torture and made an immediate sensation in heavy metal circles, winning Slayer a rabid cult following. Def Jam co-founder Rick Rubin took a liking to the band, signed them to his label, and contributed the first clear-sounding production heard on any Slayer album for the stripped-down Reign in Blood. Due to the graphic nature of the material, CBS refused to distribute the album, which garnered a great deal of publicity for the band; eventually, Geffen Records stepped in. Combining Slayer\\'s trademark speed metal with the tempos and song lengths (if not structures) of hardcore, along with the band\\'s most disturbing lyrics yet, Reign in Blood was an instant classic, breaking the band to a wider audience, and hailed by some as the greatest speed metal album of all time (some give the nod to Metallica\\'s Master of Puppets).South of Heaven disappointed some of the band\\'s hardcore followers, as Slayer successfully broke out of the potential stylistic straitjacket of their reputation as the world\\'s fastest, most extreme band. Drummer Lombardo took some time off and was briefly replaced by Whiplash drummer Tony Scaglione, but soon returned to the fold. Released in 1990, Seasons in the Abyss was well-received in all respects, incorporating more of the classic Slayer intensity into a more commercial -- but no less uncompromising -- sound. \"War Ensemble\" and the title track became favorites on MTV\\'s Headbanger\\'s Ball, and Slayer consolidated their position at the forefront of thrash, along with Metallica. Following the release of the double-live album Decade of Aggression, Lombardo left the band again and formed Grip Inc. Slayer remained quiet for a few years; the only new material released after 1990 was a duet with Ice-T recorded for the Judgment Night soundtrack on a medley of songs by the Exploited. After leaving the Forbidden, Bostaph signed on as the new drummer for 1994\\'s Divine Intervention, which was released to glowing reviews; thanks to the new death metal movement, which drew upon Slayer and particularly Reign in Blood for its inspiration, Slayer were hailed as metal innovators. The album was a massive success, debuting at number eight on the Billboard album charts. Bostaph left the band to concentrate on a side project, the Truth About Seafood, and was replaced by ex-Testament drummer Jon Dette for Undisputed Attitude, an album consisting mostly of punk and hardcore covers. Bostaph rejoined Slayer in time to record 1998\\'s Diabolus in Musica. The band reunited with Def Jam for 2001\\'s God Hates Us All and in 2002, Lombardo rejoined the band once more. In 2004, they unleashed the four-disc anthology Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, followed by an album of all-new material, Christ Illusion, in 2006. After a relentless tour and festival schedule in 2007 and 2008, Slayer emerged from the studio with World Painted Blood in 2009. In 2010, they appeared with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax on Big 4: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria. On May 2, 2013 Slayer guitarist and co-founder Jeff Hanneman died of liver failure at a Los Angeles hospital; he was 49 years old.King and Araya refused to let their friend\\'s death deter them from carrying on with Slayer and set to work writing a new album. Lombardo was kicked out of the band for the third time; Bostaph came back on board, and Exodus\\' Gary Holt, who had filled in for Hanneman when he was seriously ill with necrotizing fasciitis in 2011, joined as his permanent replacement. The album was eventually finished in 2015 and titled Repentless. Three tracks, \"When the Stillness Comes,\" \"Implode,\" and the title cut -- which King dubbed a \"HannemAnthem\" in tribute -- were released as digital singles throughout the spring and summer. Repentless appeared on September 11 through Nuclear Blast and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200. The band toured for over two years around the world before returning home, where they intended to start working on a new album. However, plans for this 13th album were eventually scrapped and, in 2018, Slayer announced what would become their farewell tour. Once again traversing the globe, their final trek extended into late 2019. To commemorate the historic milestone, the band released a special concert film, The Repentless Killogy, which paired a short movie with a full performance filmed in 2017 at the Los Angeles Forum, which was also where Slayer played their final show on November 30, 2019. In 2021, the band announced that they would be reissuing their entire Metal Blade catalog on vinyl, CD, and cassette tape. In addition to classic albums like Hell Awaits and Show No Mercy, the reissues included the Haunting the Chapel EP and the 1984 concert LP Live Undead. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "'For a brief spell during the mid-\\'80s, the heavy metal quintet Dio were one of the top U.S. concert attractions, boasting one of the most over the top stage acts of its time loaded with props and special effects (lasers, explosions, a giant dragon, etc.). The group\\'s leader was singer Ronnie James Dio, who had previously become acquainted with the metal masses as the frontman of Ritchie Blackmore\\'s Rainbow from 1975-1978 and Black Sabbath from 1979-1982. Come the early \\'80s, Ronnie James was ready to finally head out on his own, forming Dio and recruiting a stellar backing band, consisting of a few former bandmembers, ex-Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain and ex-Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice (Carmine Appice\\'s brother), in addition to ex-Sweet Savage guitar shredder Vivian Campbell. Lyrically, the group would retain the same subject matter that Ronnie James specialized in with his previous outfits (dungeons and dragons, swords and sorcery, damsels in distress, etc.), but musically, Dio were more melodically based than Rainbow or Sabbath. The group scored a hit right off the bat with its 1983 debut release, Holy Diver, which spawned such popular MTV videos as \"Rainbow in the Dark,\" as well as its title track. For their sophomore effort, 1984\\'s The Last in Line, the band expanded its lineup to include keyboardist Claude Schnell, as the album would become the biggest hit of Dio\\'s career (on the strength of another MTV-approved video, for the album\\'s anthemic title track) and the group became an arena headliner. Although Dio\\'s next release, 1985\\'s Sacred Heart, was commercially successful, Campbell had become disillusioned by the group\\'s direction and split from the group a year later. Just prior to Campbell\\'s exit, the entire Dio band helped organize Hear n\\' Aid, an all-star assembly of heavy metal artists that recorded a track called \"Stars,\" which helped fight world hunger (a subsequent album was issued as well, collecting previously unreleased live tracks from a few of the day\\'s top hard rock acts). Former Giuffria guitarist Craig Goldy took Campbell\\'s place, resulting in such releases as 1986\\'s live EP Intermission and 1987\\'s Dream Evil, which retained the group\\'s headbanging audience, but failed to expand upon it as its previous releases had. By 1990\\'s Lock Up the Wolves, Ronnie James Dio was the only original member of Dio left in attendance as the band\\'s lineup continued to fluctuate throughout the \\'90s on such releases as 1994\\'s Strange Highways, 1996\\'s Angry Machines, and 1998\\'s Inferno: Last in Live (Ronnie James took a brief break from Dio in 1992 to rejoin Black Sabbath for a lone release, Dehumanizer). In 2000, a pair of Dio releases emerged; first was Dio\\'s first new studio album in four years, the concept album Magica (which saw past members Bain and Goldy return to the group), as well as a 16-track compilation titled The Very Beast of Dio. His medieval-themed metal returned two years later, when the Killing the Dragon album arrived in the spring of 2002. The album was a serious endeavor, but Dio also learned to make fun of his image after years of defending it, inviting comedy duo Tenacious D to star in the video for \"Push\" and even including the clip on the fall re-release of Killing the Dragon. In the mid-2000s Dio the man and the band returned with the studio album Master of the Moon and the live Evil or Divine, but by 2006 the band had been sidelined upon the announcement that Ronnie James would be joining Heaven &amp; Hell, a group reuniting the singer with his late-era Sabbath brethren Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and Vinny Appice and named after the first Sabbath recording (released in 1980) that featured him as frontman. Heaven &amp; Hell toured in the late 2000s and released a live (Live from Radio City Music Hall) and a studio (Devil You Know) recording, but by November of 2009 it was announced that the singer was suffering from stomach cancer, and Heaven &amp; Hell subsequently canceled their summer 2010 touring plans. Ronnie James Dio succumbed to the disease on May 16, 2010, in Houston, TX. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'Long Island, New York\\'s Dream Theater are the globally celebrated standard bearers for progressive metal in the 21st century. Their ability to deliver tight, melodic, musically sophisticated songs and thematic concept recordings encompassing elements of hook-based hard rock, riff-fueled metal, syncopated prog, and refined lyrics have made them the act others are measured by. Their second album, 1992\\'s Images and Words, established their sonic signature, while 1994\\'s Awake and 1999\\'s Metropolis, Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory cemented their place in metal\\'s pantheon. Dream Theater is well known for high-energy concert performances. While they\\'ve released several 21st century live albums -- Live at the Marquee, Live in Japan, and Live Scenes from New York -- they remain one of the genre\\'s most bootlegged bands. For 2016\\'s The Astonishing, a double-length dystopian sci-fi opera, they were accompanied by the Prague Symphony Orchestra and three choirs. In 2021, the band issued A View from the Top of the World.Originally named Majesty (from a lyric in \"Bastille Day\"), the band was founded by Berklee College of Music students guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and drummer Mike Portnoy; they soon expanded with the addition of keyboard player Kevin Moore and vocalist Chris Collins. Releasing an eight-tune demo, Majesty Demo, as Majesty, the group sold 1,000 copies within six months. The departure of Collins in late 1986 left Majesty without a vocalist, and after a long period of auditioning possible replacements, the group settled on Charlie Dominici in November 1987. They decided to change their name to Dream Theater, inspired by a now-demolished California movie theater. Signing with Mechanic Records, the group began working on their first full-length album. Delays caused by label mismanagement limited the group to performing at small clubs and bars. Frustrated by this experience, Dream Theater finally severed its ties with Mechanic. This was only one drastic change in the band\\'s course of action. Firing Dominici, the group spent the next couple years searching for a vocalist. The search ended in late 1991 when a demo tape from Canadian vocalist James LaBrie, formerly of Winter Rose, arrived. After flying to New York to audition, LaBrie was invited to join the band. Signing with Atco Atlantic (which came to be known as East West), Dream Theater released its second album, Images &amp; Words, in 1992. One of three videos based on songs from the album, \"Pull Me Under,\" became an MTV hit. Although Theater showed considerable growth with their third studio album, Awake, recorded between May and July 1994, the group continued to be hampered by personnel changes. Before the album was mixed, keyboardist Moore left the group to focus on his solo career. Hired as a temporary replacement for the band\\'s Waking Up the World tour, Derek Sherinian later became a permanent member. His first recording with Dream Theater was a 23-minute epic, \"A Change of Seasons,\" written in 1989 and released in September 1995 on the album of the same name.Following a mini tour, Fix for \\'96, the members of Dream Theater separated for several months and became involved with a variety of outside projects. Petrucci was the busiest. In addition to joining Portnoy and keyboard player Jordan Rudess in the Liquid Tension Experiment -- a group that included influential bassist/stick player Tony Levin -- Petrucci played guitar with Trent Gardner\\'s Explorers Club and made a guest appearance on Shadow Gallery\\'s Tyranny album. Myung and Sherinian collaborated with King\\'s X vocalist Ty Tabor in the band Platypus. LaBrie worked with Mull Muzzler, a group formed with Matt Guillory and Mike Mangini.Dream Theater experienced yet another change when Rudess was tapped to replace Sherinian, who had been fired in 1999. The band released the progressive rock-heavy Scenes from a Memory that year, a conceptual piece that followed the story of the 1928 murder of a young woman and how a modern man is haunted by the crime. It was followed by Live Scenes from New York in 2001, which suffered from an unintentional bout of controversy when its original cover featuring the city of New York in flames was pulled due to the events of September 11. The group continued in the progressive metal vein in 2002 with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, followed by the leaner Train of Thought in 2003 and Octavarium in 2005. The live album Score: XOX was released in 2006 and featured the band backed by a 29-piece orchestra. It was followed a year later by the new studio album Systematic Chaos, and in 2009 by Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings. Sherinian went on to record as a soloist and to play with a prog and jazz fusion band, Planet X. Petrucci released an eponymously titled solo album in 2003, featuring accompaniment by Dave LaRue of the Dixie Dregs and Boston-based drummer Dave DiCenso. In late 2010, Mike Mangini joined the group, replacing drummer Mike Portnoy, who left the band in September of that year. With a rigorous touring schedule that firmly broke in Mangini, Dream Theater somehow found time to record. They pre-released the track \"On the Backs of Angels\" on YouTube via their label, Roadrunner, in June of 2011, followed by the CD release of the aptly titled full-length A Dramatic Turn of Events in the fall. After a period of rigorous international touring, the band took a break, though its members continued writing. They reconvened in early 2013 and returned with a self-titled studio album in September -- this one with Mangini completely involved in the writing process -- followed in November with the concert recording Live at Luna Park on CD and DVD, which was recorded during the Dramatic Turn of Events tour over two nights at the Buenos Aires soccer stadium. Recorded live at the Boston Opera House on March 24, 2014, the concert recording Breaking the Fourth Wall arrived the following year, and in late 2015 the band announced their upcoming 13th studio album, The Astonishing. A completely conceptual sci-fi offering, it was released in January 2016. After a world tour in which they performed the whole of the album, the band took an extended breather. At the end of 2018, Dream Theater released the single and video for \"Untethered Angel\" in advance of a North American tour. The full-length Distance Over Time was the first album by the band to clock in at less than an hour in length in over a decade. Petrucci credited the more economical running time to a more collaborative writing process that took a mere 18 days to complete, and focused on harder-edged songs than on more recent recordings. Distance Over Time was released by Inside Out in early 2019. Taking the album on the road, Dream Theater played a sold-out show at London\\'s Apollo, which was recorded for prosperity. Released in November 2020, Distant Memories: Live in London, not only featured live tracks from the album but a 20th anniversary celebration of their 1999 concept album, Metropolis, Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory. In 2021, the band returned with A View from the Top of the World. Its seven extended tracks ranged from just over six to 20 minutes and comprised -- for the first time in many years -- an aural portrait of the band mapping out prog metal architectures and compositions without a guiding concept or theme. ~ Craig Harris, Rovi'\n",

In 1988, they were the first Western rock band to play soldout shows 5 days in a row in the then still Soviet Leningrad. Pioneering achievements elsewhere as well: through very early concerts in China and Southeast Asia, they have opened doors for many other Western bands.

      "'New York goth metal quartet Type O Negative were led by vocalist/bassist/songwriter Peter Steele and featured guitarist Ken Hickey, keyboardist Josh Silver, and drummer Johnny Kelly. Steele formed Type O Negative in 1990 out of the remnants of thrash band Carnivore, along with his friend Sal Abruscato (drums). Type O\\'s music slowed down the tempos of thrash metal, alternately satirizing and wallowing in a glum mixture of misanthropy, misogyny, depression, and vampiric vocals, as well as loads of cheap-sounding guitar distortion. The band\\'s debut album, Slow, Deep and Hard, was released in 1991, featuring long, mopey dirges with titles like \"Unsuccessfully Coping with the Natural Beauty of Infidelity.\" Not everyone appreciated Steele\\'s dark sense of humor, though, and he was roasted by some critics who charged him with being a homicidal misogynist and Nazi sympathizer. A fake live album, The Origin of the Feces, appeared the following year, its notorious cover depicting a pair of spread buttocks (the album was eventually reissued with less graphic artwork). Released in 1993, Bloody Kisses added surprisingly skilled Beatlesque melodies, and Steele\\'s often ironic treatments of his depressing subject matter and the emotional and musical excesses of goth (particularly Type O Negative\\'s brand) were deadly accurate and often very funny. Abruscato departed following its release to join Life of Agony, at which point Kelly joined the band. Bloody Kisses slowly won the band a cult following, thanks in part to the video for \"Black No. 1\" and the band\\'s constant touring, and the album cracked Billboard\\'s Top 200 well over a year after its release. The more upbeat follow-up, October Rust, appeared in 1996, building on the more pop-oriented tracks of its predecessor; in the meantime, Steele achieved notoriety by appearing as a Playgirl magazine centerfold. World Coming Down finally appeared in 1999 after a three-year hiatus, a considerably darker affair than October Rust but proof that -- in spite of Steele\\'s pronouncements to the contrary -- its predecessors were no fluke. In 2000, Roadrunner compiled The Least Worst of Type O Negative, which featured European single edits and alternate mixes of the band\\'s most popular songs, plus several unreleased tracks. Life Is Killing Me arrived in 2003 with a cover of \"Angry Inch\" from the film Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Four years passed before the band returned with Dead Again. On April 14, 2010, Steele died from apparent heart failure at the age of 48, which brought Type O Negative to a close as a performing and recording unit. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

Bass is showcased, new vocals are introduced, and as expected, the guitarwork of Peterson and Skolnick is greatly complex and mesmerizing.Titans of Creation has many moods and material contained within; all of which somehow tie into a common philosophy of creation and its necessary counterpart: destruction. “Children Of The Next Level” smashes through the gates as the opening track with a flood of sound that prepares the listener for an abundance of violent thrash. Meanwhile, the lyrics rage about the outrageous philosophies of the Heaven's Gate cult (founded in 1974).TESTAMENT's process of creation has evolved and progressed yet they've remained steadfast over the course of literal decades. While always managing to present the genuine aspects of thrash metal that solidify their existence, they spread into unique horizons through developing crisp and fascinating sounds.\"\n",

      "\"Formed in 1992, Amon Amarth became modern metal greats the hard way. The Swedes steadily built a formidable reputation as a ferocious live band and, as the years passed, were increasingly recognised for their recorded achievements. Breakthrough releases like 2006's With Oden On Our Side and 2008's Twilight Of The Thunder God, cemented their popularity throughout the metal world. Jomsviking (2015) hit the #1 spot in Germany's official album chart and swiftly became their most successful worldwide release to date. Amon Amarth return to action in 2019, with their biggest, boldest and most bombastic musical statement to date. Amon Amarth – completed by vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Olavi Mikkonen and Johan Söderberg, bassist Ted Lundström and drummer Jocke Wallgren - know that expectations for their next move are at an all-time high. The excellent news is that the band's 11th studio album, the aptly-named Berserker, is guaranteed to have all discerning metal fans punching the air with joy. Today, Amon Amarth stand tall and unassailable: over 25 years into a career that has seen them evolve from humble origins in the dark, dank rehearsal rooms of their native Tumba to their current status as explosive festival headliners and one of the metal world's most widely adored bands. All of this and more has been captured in the band's recent live DVD and documentary, The Pursuit Of Vikings: 25 Years In The Eye Of The Storm.\"\n",

      "'Nearly as much as Metallica and Megadeth, Anthrax were responsible for the emergence of speed and thrash metal. Combining the speed and fury of hardcore punk with the prominent guitars and vocals of heavy metal, they helped create a new subgenre of heavy metal on their early albums. Original guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Spitz were a formidable pair, spitting out lightning-fast riffs and solos that never seemed masturbatory. Unlike Metallica or Megadeth, they had the good sense to temper their often serious music with a healthy dose of humor and realism. After their first album, Fistful of Metal, singer Joey Belladonna and bassist Frank Bello joined the lineup. Belladonna helped take the band farther away from conventional metal clichés, and over the next five albums (with the exception of 1988\\'s State of Euphoria, where the band sounded like it was in a creative straitjacket), Anthrax arguably became the leaders of speed metal. As the \\'80s became the \\'90s, they also began to increase their experiments with hip-hop, culminating in a tour with Public Enemy in 1991, and a joint re-recording of PE\\'s classic \"Bring the Noise.\" The remainder of the decade saw the band continuing to both flex and expand its sonic muscle, but lineup changes and label woes remained a constant stress throughout, and by 2003 they were only playing sporadically. In 2010, after a seven-year hiatus, Anthrax reconvened for Worship Music, a return to form that many called their most potent offering since 1990\\'s Persistence of Time. After their peak period in the late \\'80s, Anthrax kicked Belladonna out of the band in 1992 and replaced him with ex-Armored Saint vocalist John Bush -- a singer who was gruffer and deeper, fitting most metal conventions perfectly. Subsequently, their sound became less unique and their audience shrank slightly as a consequence, and after signing to Elektra for 1993\\'s Sound of White Noise, the group left the label after just one more album, 1995\\'s Stomp 442. At that point, Anthrax -- now a four-piece consisting of Ian, Bush, Bello, and drummer Charlie Benante -- built their own studio in Yonkers, New York, and after a three-year hiatus returned with their Ignition label debut, Volume 8: The Threat Is Real. Anthrax\\'s very first \"hits\" collection was released in 1999; titled Return of the Killer A\\'s: The Best Of, it was also their first release for the Beyond label. The album included a cover of \"Ball of Confusion,\" which featured a duet between current frontman Bush and former vocalist Belladonna. A proposed tour that was to include both vocalists was announced, but on the eve of its launch, Belladonna pulled out, reportedly for monetary reasons. The tour carried on, as Anthrax signed on to participate in a package tour during the summer of 2000 with Mötley Crüe and Megadeth, but left the tour after only playing a handful of dates. Anthrax appeared on the Twisted Sister tribute album Twisted Forever in 2001 (covering the track \"Destroyer\"), and began recording their next album the same year. In addition, guitarist Ian found time to regularly host the metal television program Rock Show on VH1, plus he appeared as part of the fictional metal band Titannica in the film Run, Ronnie, Run. VH1 programming heads eventually replaced Ian with Sebastian Bach, but the band was ready to head back into the studio anyway. New guitarist Rob Caggiano joined in the spring of 2002, just in time for the recording. A year later, Anthrax made their Sanctuary debut with We\\'ve Come for You All. The band\\'s dynamic hadn\\'t changed, and touring in support of that album was met with overwhelming success. The CD/DVD set Music of Mass Destruction: Live in Chicago, which arrived in spring 2004, celebrated Anthrax\\'s two decades in the business. Then, in 2005, Anthrax\\'s entire original lineup of Ian, Spitz, Belladonna, Benante, and Bello reunited for a tour and the CD/DVD retrospective Anthology: No Hit Wonders 1985-1991. Anthrax also issued Alive 2, recorded during their summer 2005 reunion tour. In 2007, Dan Nelson, formerly of the group Devilsize, took over vocal duties. The band announced the return of vocalist John Bush in 2009, though the stint was never deemed permanent. The vocal pendulum shifted again the following year with an announcement that Belladonna was returning to the fold for future shows, and beginning work on a new Anthrax album. The resulting Worship Music, the band\\'s tenth studio album, and the first to feature original material since 2003\\'s We\\'ve Come for You All, was released on September 13, 2011. Worship Music was a strong comeback that earned the group a Grammy nomination, and Anthrax followed it up with some dumb fun in the form of a 2013 EP of \\'70s classic rock covers, titled Anthems. Shortly before the EP was released, Caggiano left the group, and he was replaced by Shadows Fall guitarist Jonathan Donais during live dates. In August, he officially became Anthrax\\'s lead guitarist.The group began working on a new studio album in late 2013. A live DVD titled Chile on Hell appeared in 2014. The following year, they toured with Volbeat, whom Caggiano had joined after leaving Anthrax. The group\\'s 11th studio album, For All Kings, was released in February of 2016. Anthrax then toured with Iron Maiden, opening up for the metal legends during the Latin American leg of their Book of Souls World Tour. In 2018, the band released Kings Among Scotland, a concert film/album recorded on February 15, 2017 at Glasgow\\'s Barrowland Ballroom. To commemorate the band\\'s 40th anniversary, Anthrax staged a global livestream event in 2021 at the Los Angeles sound stage/studio where they performed a two-hour set of fan favorites and deep cuts. The concert/film XL, which included the entire performance as well as rehearsal footage and a Scott Ian-led walking tour of formative New York locations, was released in 2022 by Nuclear Blast. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'An American deathcore group that draws on elements of black metal, grindcore, mathcore, and groove metal, Suicide Silence emerged in 2007 with the punishing full-length debut The Cleansing. Subsequent albums continued to look to artists like Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse, Death, and Possessed for inspiration, while their eponymous fifth studio long-player, released in 2017, incorporated clean, nu-metal style vocals into the mix. 2020\\'s Become the Hunter and 2023\\'s Remember... You Must Die saw Suicide Silence return to the uncompromising deathcore sound of their earlier outings. Formed in Riverside, California in 2002, the band managed to get things rolling quickly, save for a few lineup changes, and went from formation to a deal with Century Media in a mere two years. In the meantime, Suicide Silence issued one pre-deal EP -- the simply titled Suicide Silence -- which saw the light of day on indie labels At the Deep End and SOS Records.The band\\'s Century Media debut album, The Cleansing, was released in September of 2007, and was produced by John Travis. The album was a bit of a mover and shaker in the genre, breaking through to the Top 100 on the Billboard charts, and became one of the label\\'s biggest-ever sellers. Following the release of the album, the band toured steadily in the U.S. and Europe with Parkway Drive and Bury Your Dead. Members Mitch Lucker (vocals), Chris Garza (guitar), Mark Heylmun (guitar), Mike Bodkins (bass, but later replaced by Dan Kenny), and Alex Lopez (drums) had more reason to celebrate in 2008, as the band was added to the Mayhem Metal Festival, which hit stages that summer.No Time to Bleed, released in 2009, found the band in the Top 40 of the album charts for the first time, accompanied by positive reviews. Third album The Black Crown switched from anti-religious topics to personal themes from lyricist Mitch Lucker, and it became the highest-charting album of their career. Lucker, however, died in November 2012 from injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. A memorial tribute show later that year featured Suicide Silence backed by different vocalists for each song, and by the fall of 2013, the band had found their new lead vocalist, Hernan \"Eddie\" Hermida from All Shall Perish. The Lucker memorial show was released early in 2014 as Ending Is the Beginning: The Mitch Lucker Memorial Show 12.21.12. 2017 saw the release of the band\\'s eponymous fifth studio long-player, which featured a shift in tone from their deathcore roots into a more melodic, nu-metal-driven direction. For their sixth full-length effort, 2020\\'s Become the Hunter, the band enlisted producer Steve Evetts (The Dillinger Escape Plan, Sepultura, Hatebreed), and dialed down the clean singing in a return to their extreme metal roots. The band continued to embrace the brutality of modern deathcore on 2023\\'s unrelenting Remember… You Must Die, which featured cover art by Necrosurrealist artist David Van Gough. ~ Chris True, Rovi'\n",

      "'Orlando, Florida\\'s Trivium are among the most provocative, restless, and influential bands to emerge from the American South\\'s heavy metal explosion in the early 21st century. Beginning as a metalcore outfit, they have relentlessly combined and crossed styles including thrash, prog, technical, and melodic death metal, as well as alternative and groove metal. Trivium came by their global success the old-fashioned way: touring. Since issuing their first demo in 2000, they have been road warriors. They established themselves first in the South, and then across North America before conquering festival stages in Europe and Asia supporting their sophomore long-player Ascendancy in 2005. 2008\\'s Shogun showcased epic storytelling abilities as well as a love for innovative riffs. Its compositional tenets and love for narrative storytelling influenced each subsequent release, beginning with 2011\\'s In Waves. 2017\\'s The Sin and the Sentence used them inside an extreme metal setting and became one of their most acclaimed albums, selling better in Europe than it did in the States. 2020\\'s What the Dead Men Say fully integrated all their musical tenets. 2021\\'s In the Court of the Dragon was written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic.Hailing from central Florida, Trivium formed in 1999 and quickly built a buzz around Orlando\\'s metal community with their blend of metalcore, thrash, and progressive metal. Having secured a contract with the German Lifeforce imprint, the band issued its debut album, Ember to Inferno, in October 2003 with a lineup that included vocalist/guitarist Matt Heafy, drummer Travis Smith, and bassist Brent Young. The debut was well-received and Trivium signed with Roadrunner Records for their next effort. Ascendancy appeared in March 2005, at which point the band\\'s roster had shifted to include Heafy, Smith, bassist Paolo Gregoletto, and guitarist Corey Beaulieu. The album was reissued in May of the following year with four additional tracks and a bonus DVD. Trivium then visited the U.K. in June for the 2006 Download Festival, followed by multiple European headlining gigs and a stint with America\\'s traveling metal/hardcore fest Sounds of the Underground. The tour saw them playing alongside other heavy-hitting bands like As I Lay Dying, GWAR, Cannibal Corpse, and Terror.Crusade appeared that fall, featuring a newfound emphasis on singing (previously, vocalist Heafy had relied on screams and throaty growls). Despite the band\\'s active defense of Heafy\\'s vocal approach, Trivium received much criticism for their shift in sound; accordingly, they wasted no time in returning to a scream-filled thrash style with 2008\\'s Shogun. In 2010, Trivium announced drummer Nick Augusto would be replacing the departing Smith. Later that year, the band went into the studio to begin work on their fifth studio album, In Waves, which was released in the summer of 2011 and saw the group bring a bold new approach and maturity to its songwriting. However, feeling that the album\\'s gestation process had been overlong and that they had produced too much material, they decided to focus on quality rather than quantity in the on-the-road writing sessions for their next record. The band tapped Disturbed\\'s David Draiman to produce, and the metal veteran took a real hands-on approach, bringing a newfound sense of melody to Trivium\\'s sound. The finished album, Vengeance Falls, was released in October of 2013; it received enthusiastic reviews from critics and charted well in the United States, the U.K., Japan, and Europe.Trivium underwent yet another personnel change when they parted company with drummer Augusto in May of 2014. He was replaced by drum tech Matt Madiro. Late in the year, Trivium entered the studio with producer Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette and mixing engineer Josh Wilbur to begin work on the band\\'s seventh album. The title track, \"Silence in the Snow,\" was issued as a video single in July of 2015, and the album followed on Roadrunner in early October. Silence in the Snow was their first full-length to land on the Active Rock Top Ten and secured them headliner status for the European festivals Summerbreeze and Bloodstock. After the release of the album, Madiro left the band and was succeeded by Paul Wandtke, who lasted less than a year before being replaced by Alex Bent. In late 2016, Trivium partnered with Cooking Vinyl to re-release Ember to Inferno in several variations. The two deluxe editions contained the band\\'s earliest demos, including \"Ruber\" (aka the Red Demo), \"Caeruleus\" (aka the Blue Demo), and \"Flavus\" (aka the Yellow Demo), all recorded when Heafy was between 16 and 17 years old. Late 2017 saw the release of the band\\'s eighth studio long-player, The Sin and the Sentence, which was produced by Josh Wilbur and released on Roadrunner. The set peaked at number 23 on the Top 200, and landed in the top spot on the Hard Rock Albums chart. After extensive touring and a well-deserved break, the band re-entered the studio with Wilbur in late 2019. In February of the following year, Trivium\\'s members began adding cryptic messages to their social media accounts to attract interest for their upcoming album. They further teased its release with two songs -- \"IX\" and \"Scattering the Ashes\" -- added to the \"Spawn\" trailer for the Mortal Kombat video game in March. Trivium delivered their ninth full-length, What the Dead Men Say, in April. Original bassist Brent Young died on September 25, 2020; he was 37 years old. Sidelined by the global quarantine imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Trivium wrote and recorded the Wilbur-produced In the Court of the Dragon while in isolation; it was released in October 2021. ~ Johnny Loftus, Rovi'\n",

Exploding into the world's consciousness with 1994's seminal Burn My Eyes album, the now legendary Oakland crew brutishly redefined what it meant to be heavy, incorporating a wild array of influences into some of the sharpest and most brutal metal anthems ever written. Nearly three decades later, the band founded and led by vocalist/guitarist Robb Flynn has amassed an extraordinary catalogue of classic albums, while routinely enhancing an already formidable reputation as one of heavy music's most powerful and relentless live bands.From the controversial but hugely successful experiments of 1999's The Burning Red to the globe-conquering might and bombast of 2006's The Blackening (which saw them tour the world for 3 full years, supporting Metallica along the way) Machine Head have never stagnated creatively or taken their foot from the artistic accelerator. With albums like 2014's Bloodstone &amp; Diamonds and 2018's diverse, destructive and politically-supercharged Catharsis, Machine Head have continued their exhilarating evolution, while never losing the furious spirit of their old school, underground roots.

      "'Taking their name from the original Japanese pronunciation of Godzilla, French heavy metal quartet Gojira have risen from the utmost obscurity during the first half of their career to widespread global recognition in the second. Combining elements of thrash, death, math, groove, progressive, and post-metal with philosophical and environment-themed lyrics, the band found mainstream favor in 2012 with the release of their fifth long-player L\\'Enfant Sauvage and doubled-down on that success with 2016\\'s Grammy-nominated Magma and 2021\\'s hard-hitting and versatile Fortitude. Originating from the town of Bayonne on France\\'s southernmost Atlantic Ocean coastline, Gojira recorded the first in a sequence of almost yearly demos in 1996, gradually honing their sound until the year 2000, when bandmembers Joe Duplantier (vocals/guitar), Christian Andreu (guitar), Jean-Michel Labadie (bass), and Mario Duplantier (drums), felt ready to record their first album, Terra Incognita, relying solely on their own devices. And despite its independent status, the aptly named LP made significant waves with its unpredictable blend of death, thrash, groove, progressive, and math metal -- recalling bands as diverse as Pantera, Meshuggah, Suffocation, and Sepultura.It still took several years (and a curious detour into soundtrack music on 2003\\'s Maciste All Inferno EP) for the metal world to catch on, and even Gojira\\'s second album, The Link, had to be released through the tiny independent Boycott Records before being reissued by Listenable. (This was followed by 2004\\'s The Link Alive live album and corresponding video set, whose audio component was limited to 500 copies -- a parting shot for Boycott.) Now finally gathering steam, Gojira saw their third full-length, From Mars to Sirius, enter the French charts at number 44, while collecting the most enthusiastic reviews of their career -- a level of acclaim that led, in turn, to numerous key European festival appearances, and lengthy European and North American tours with Obituary, Hatesphere, Children of Bodom, and Machine Head, to name but a few. By the end of the long promotional cycle for From Mars to Sirius, Gojira were widely acknowledged as a force to be reckoned with, on-stage and in the studio, and their much anticipated fourth LP, The Way of All Flesh (released stateside by Prosthetic Records), made a strong showing by debuting at number 138 on the American charts in October 2008. The extensive touring schedule that Gojira then undertook meant that fans would have to wait nearly four years for the band\\'s next studio album, although they did get the expansive The Flesh Alive video set to tide them over. In 2012, the band moved up to the big leagues, signing to major-label Roadrunner for the release of L\\'Enfant Sauvage (\"The Wild Child\"), inspired by the Truffaut film of the same name. It earned wide critical praise, as well as a Top 40 showing on the U.S., Canadian, Swedish, and French charts. Long years of touring and occasional recording -- including another live album, Les Enfants Sauvages -- were followed by the release of Gojira\\'s acclaimed sixth album, Magma, which was released in 2016 and earned the band a pair of nominations at the 2017 Grammy Awards. Four years later, Gojira returned with Fortitude, which was preceded by the arrival of the dynamic Eastern philosophy-inspired single \"Born for One Thing.\" The full-length topped the streaming charts upon its release, and the track \"Amazonia\" was nominated for a Grammy Award. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'Atlanta\\'s Mastodon are one of the most original and influential American metal bands to appear in the 21st century. Their wide-angle progressive approach encompasses stoner and sludge metal, punishing hardcore and metalcore, neo-psych, death metal, and more. The group\\'s playing style incorporates technically complex guitar riffs, lyric hooks, long, melodic instrumental passages, and intricate, jazz-influenced drumming with syncopated time signatures. Their second album, 2004\\'s Leviathan, was a concept offering based on Moby Dick, Herman Melville\\'s iconic novel of whaling and obsession, and became the band\\'s commercial breakthrough. The record is regarded critically as one of the most important albums in genre history. 2011\\'s conceptual The Hunter reflected the band\\'s embrace of prog; it channeled disparate influences ranging from King Crimson to Opeth. 2017\\'s Emperor of Sand debuted inside the Top Ten and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Album -- the single \"Sultan\\'s Curse\" took one home for Best Metal Performance. Change and evolution (Mastodon\\'s raison d\\'être) are as integral to their musical identity as their personnel. 2020 saw the issue of Medium Rarities, featuring live cuts, covers, and instrumentals. In 2021, Mastodon returned to proper studio recording with the double-length Hushed and Grim. Mastodon formed in 1999 around the talents of guitarist Bill Kelliher, drummer Bränn Dailor, bassist/vocalist Troy Sanders, and guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds. One of the more notable New Wave of American Heavy Metal acts, a genre spawned in the mid-\\'90s by bands like Pantera, Biohazard, and Machine Head, Mastodon\\'s innovative, lyrically astute blend of metal subgenres helped position the band as one of the pre-eminent metal acts of the early 21st century.Formed out of a mutual admiration of the Melvins, Black Sabbath, Neurosis, and Thin Lizzy, Mastodon signed with Relapse Records (Today Is the Day, Dillinger Escape Plan, Coalesce) in 2001 on the strength of a four-song demo. The EP Lifesblood arrived that same year, followed by the group\\'s full-length debut, Remission, in 2002. The album made positive waves in the metal community, but it wasn\\'t until 2004\\'s Leviathan that the band\\'s eclectic brand of proto-metal began to enter the bloodstream of the entire music community. As polished and melodic as it was brutal and genre-defying, Leviathan, loosely based on Herman Melville\\'s Moby Dick, signaled a turning point in Mastodon\\'s career, appearing on critics\\' year-end Top Ten lists across the musical spectrum. Leviathan also featured a guest vocal appearance from Neurosis\\' frontman Scott Kelly, which marked the beginning of a tradition: He has appeared on each of the band\\'s full-length recordings ever since. Mastodon\\'s newfound popularity eventually landed them a deal with Warner Bros., but not before fulfilling their contract with Relapse in 2006 with Call of the Mastodon, a remastered version of the group\\'s first two demo EPs, and Workhorse Chronicles, a DVD that chronicled the band\\'s story thus far with interviews and concert footage. Their third album, Blood Mountain, debuted at number 32 on the Billboard charts and received a Grammy nomination in the Best Metal Performance category for the song \"Colony of Birchmen.\" Blood Mountain marked the group\\'s highest chart peak to date and set the stage for its long-awaited 2009 follow-up Crack the Skye. In 2011, the band released the CD/DVD package Live at the Aragon, which was recorded in Chicago during the Crack the Skye tour. Mastodon quickly followed with new material, taking a step back from their more prog-oriented approach on their fifth studio album, The Hunter. It gave them huge commercial success, hitting number ten on the Billboard charts.Later in 2011, Troy Sanders took some time out from the band, forming the metal supergroup Killer Be Killed with Dillinger Escape Plan vocalist Greg Puciato, Soulfly\\'s Max Cavalera, and former Mars Volta drummer Dave Elitch. He worked with the group on and off for the next few years; their debut album was eventually released in 2014. Mastodon was still a priority, however. After touring Europe and South America in 2012, they started work on their sixth album the following year with producer Nick Raskulinecz. The record, eventually titled Once More \\'Round the Sun, was released in June 2014, preceded by the sludgy single \"High Road.\" Over the next two years, several of the bandmembers\\' relatives suffered from cancer. Sanders\\' wife, Jeza, received treatment for breast cancer, recovering in 2015; the following year, Kelliher\\'s mother died of a brain tumor and Dailor\\'s mother also received a diagnosis. These traumatic experiences informed the lyrics of the band\\'s seventh album, Emperor of Sand, produced by Brendan O\\'Brien and released in 2017. Its concept, revolving around the curse placed on a wandering traveler by a desert ruler, was acknowledged by Dailor in interviews as a metaphor for cancer. The late summer of 2020 saw the release of Medium Rarities, a stopgap compilation of instrumentals, live tracks, and covers. Led by the previously unissued single \"Fallen Torches\" (recorded with Neurosis\\' Kelly as guest vocalist), the 16-song set included readings of Feist\\'s \"A Commotion,\" Metallica\\'s \"Orion,\" Flaming Lips\\' \"A Spoonful Weighs a Ton,\" and \"Atlanta\" with guest Gibby Haynes. The comp also included \"White Walker,\" their contribution to the HBO series Game of Thrones. In October 2021, Mastodon issued the sprawling, double-length Hushed and Grim. Produced by David Bottrill (Tool, Rush, Peter Gabriel) the 15-track set was penned and recorded over the course of a year. Its stylistic palette crisscrossed death and sludge metal, alt and hard rock, psychedelia, punk, and prog. ~ James Christopher Monger &amp; John D. Buchanan, Rovi'\n",

We Came As Romans' initial ascent was quick and assured, catapulting the band (who met as teens) into the hearts of diehard fans immersed in the metalcore, post-hardcore, and Warped Tour subculture. Their hook-filled heavy music carried an uplifting message and connects with even greater urgency live. The increasingly diverse catalog of metallic might, melodic strength, and electronic atmosphere soars in clubs, theaters, and fests.

      "\"With unflinching tenacity, the impenetrable heavy metal hardcore factory that is HATEBREED has brought forth yet another iron cast, sonic weapon with Weight Of The False Self. It comes as no surprise that their eighth, full length album is the result of the usual sweat and blood that have cemented HATEBREED's unique niche in the world of music for over two decades. Renowned for their ability to provide an intense and cathartic release for their fans, HATEBREED challenged their writing style through this album cycle in order to produce material that is exceptionally relatable in a contemporary world flooded with overstimulation, emotional dampening, and lack of social patience.A metaphorical weight is carried by almost every individual in regards to their emotional construct. Our experiences shape who we become and over time, gradually produce a heavy burden that we continue to lug along. For many of us, the weight becomes so much that we struggle to get out from underneath, let alone move. It is these struggles that are translated throughout Weight Of The False Self. Recording the album once more with the help of ZEUSS, the band experienced a sense of challenge and breakthrough that enabled them to obtain a new level of sound. After working with the band for several years, and while normally spending his time with bands that have a fairly different sound, Zeuss is able to test HATEBREED and expand their already infamous vibration.\"\n",

      "\"Darker Still, McCall says, is the vision he and his bandmates – guitarists Jeff Ling and Luke Kilpatrick, bassist Jia O'Connor and drummer Ben Gordon – have held in their mind's eye since a misfit group of friends first convened in their parents' basements and backyards in 2003. The journey to reach this moment has seen Parkway evolve from metal underdogs to festival-headlining behemoth, off the back of close to 20 gruelling years, six critically and commercially acclaimed studio albums (all of which achieving Gold status in their home nation), three documentaries, one live album, and many, many thousands of shows. To understand that growth is to understand Darker Still, both musically and thematically. Those who thought they had Parkway Drive figured out – the unrivalled energy, the high-octane breakdowns, McCall's trademark bark – need reconsider everything they know about Australia's masters of heavy. Darker Still stands as the culmination of a transformative time that has seen Parkway reach new heights of creativity and success by eschewing the restrictive, safe conventions of genre and abandoning their own self-imposed rules in favour of a wide-eyed appreciation of bold new horizons. This is the Parkway Drive the band have been striving to be for two decades. Emerging from the darkness of the past few years, this is the true face of Parkway: redefined and resolute, focused in mind and defiant in spirit.\"\n",

They've also sold more than a million units, racked up over 800 million Spotify streams and 500 million YouTube views, two Gold-selling albums and singles (and one Silver album in the UK) and sold out entire continental tours (including their own curated Self Help Festival), amassing a global fanbase whose members number in the millions. All of which explains why Rolling Stone called them “An Artist You Need To Know.” In other words, their creative process has worked and worked well. But for new album Bad Vibrations, the Ocala, Florida-based quintet switched gears and headed for uncharted territory. “We completely changed the way we wrote, recorded and mixed this album,” says vocalist Jeremy McKinnon. “It was one of the most unique recording experiences we've ever had. We rented a cabin in the Colorado mountains and just wrote with the five of us together in a room, which was the polar opposite of the last three albums we've made. We just let things happen organically and in the moment. I think it forever changed the way we make music.”Bad Vibrations debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Top Album Sales Chart.

      "'In many ways, Def Leppard were the definitive hard rock band of the \\'80s. There were groups that rocked harder, but few captured the spirit of the times quite as well. Emerging in the late \\'70s as part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Def Leppard gained a following outside of that scene by toning down their heavy riffs and emphasizing melody. After a couple of strong albums, they were poised for crossover success by the time of 1983\\'s Pyromania, and skillfully used the fledgling MTV network to their advantage. They reached the pinnacle of their career with 1987\\'s blockbuster Hysteria, then had another big hit, 1992\\'s Adrenalize, that defied the mainstream turn toward grunge. After that, the band settled into a pattern of touring exhaustively and releasing an album every few years, maintaining a steady audience and occasionally surprising fans with a new album, like 2008\\'s Yeah!, that harked back to the sound of their glory days, or the oversized 2022 record Diamond Star Halos.Def Leppard originated in a Sheffield-based group that teenagers Rick Savage (bass) and Pete Willis (guitar) formed in 1977. Vocalist Joe Elliott, a fanatical follower of Mott the Hoople and T. Rex, joined the band several months later, bringing the name Deaf Leopard with him. After a spelling change, the trio, augmented by a now-forgotten drummer, began playing local Sheffield pubs, and within a year the band had added guitarist Steve Clark to the lineup, as well as a new drummer. Later in 1978, they recorded their debut EP, Getcha Rocks Off, and released it on their own label, Bludgeon Riffola. The EP became a word-of-mouth success, earning airplay on the BBC. Following the release of Getcha Rocks Off, 15-year-old Rick Allen was added as the band\\'s permanent drummer, and Def Leppard quickly became the toast of the British music weeklies. They soon signed with AC/DC\\'s manager, Peter Mensch, who helped them secure a contract with Mercury Records. On Through the Night, the band\\'s full-length debut, was released in 1980 and instantly became a hit in the U.K., also earning significant airplay in the U.S., where it reached number 51 on the charts. Over the course of the year, Def Leppard relentlessly toured Britain and America, playing their own shows while also opening concerts for Ozzy Osbourne, Sammy Hagar, and Judas Priest. High \\'n\\' Dry followed in 1981 and became the group\\'s first platinum album in the U.S., thanks to MTV\\'s strong rotation of \"Bringin\\' on the Heartbreak.\"As the band recorded the follow-up to High \\'n\\' Dry with producer Mutt Lange, Pete Willis was fired from the group because of his alcoholism, and Phil Collen, a former guitarist for Girl, was hired to replace him. The resulting album, 1983\\'s Pyromania, became an unexpected blockbuster, due not only to Def Leppard\\'s skillful, melodic metal, but also to MTV\\'s repeated airing of \"Photograph\" and \"Rock of Ages.\" Pyromania went on to sell ten million copies, establishing Def Leppard as one of the most popular bands in the world. Despite their success, they were about to enter a trying time in their career. Following an extensive international tour, the group reentered the studio to record the follow-up, but producer Lange was unavailable, so they began sessions with Jim Steinman, the man responsible for Meat Loaf\\'s Bat Out of Hell. The pairing turned out to be ill-advised, so the bandmembers turned to their former engineer, Nigel Green. One month into recording, Allen lost his left arm in a New Year\\'s Eve car accident. The arm was reattached, but it had to be amputated once an infection set in.Def Leppard\\'s future looked cloudy without a drummer, but by the spring of 1985 -- just a few months after his accident -- Allen began learning to play a custom-made electronic kit assembled for him by Simmons. The band soon resumed recording, and within a few months, Lange was back on board; having judged all the existing tapes inferior, he ordered the band to begin work all over again. Recording sessions continued throughout 1986, and that summer, the group returned to the stage for the European Monsters of Rock tour. Def Leppard finally completed their fourth album, now titled Hysteria, early in 1987. The record was released that spring to lukewarm reviews, with many critics claiming that the album compromised Leppard\\'s metal roots for sweet pop flourishes. Accordingly, Hysteria was slow out of the starting gates -- \"Women,\" the first single, failed to really take hold -- but the release of \"Animal\" helped the album gather steam. The song became Def Leppard\\'s first Top 40 hit in the U.K., but more importantly, it launched a string of six straight Top 20 hits in the U.S., which also included \"Hysteria,\" \"Pour Some Sugar on Me,\" \"Love Bites,\" \"Armageddon It,\" and \"Rocket,\" the latter of which arrived in 1989, a full two years after the release of Hysteria. During those two years, Def Leppard\\'s presence was unavoidable -- they were the kings of high school metal, ruling the pop charts and MTV, and teenagers and bands alike replicated their teased hair and ripped jeans, even when the grimy hard rock of Guns N\\' Roses took hold in 1988.Hysteria proved to be the peak of Leppard\\'s popularity, yet their follow-up remained eagerly awaited in the early \\'90s, as the band took a break from the road and set to work on a new record. During the recording process, however, Steve Clark died from an overdose of alcohol and drugs. Clark had historically battled alcohol, and following their Hysteria heyday, his bandmates forced him to take a sabbatical. Although he did enter rehab, Clark\\'s habits continued, and his abuse was so crippling that Collen began recording the majority of the band\\'s guitar leads. Following Clark\\'s death, Def Leppard resolved to finish their forthcoming album as a quartet, releasing Adrenalize in the spring of 1992. Adrenalize was greeted with mixed reviews, and even though the album debuted at number one and contained several successful singles, including the Top 20 hits \"Let\\'s Get Rocked\" (notable for having one of the first ever CGI music videos) and \"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad,\" the record was a commercial disappointment in the wake of Pyromania and Hysteria. After its release, the group added former Whitesnake guitarist Vivian Campbell to the lineup, thus resuming Def Leppard\\'s two-guitar attack. In 1993, Def Leppard issued the rarities collection Retro Active, which yielded another Top 20 hit with the acoustic ballad \"Two Steps Behind.\" Two years later, the group released the greatest-hits collection Vault while preparing for their sixth album. Slang arrived in the spring of 1996, and while it proved more adventurous than its predecessor, it was greeted with indifference, indicating that Leppard\\'s heyday had indeed passed, and they were now simply a very popular cult band. Undaunted, Leppard soldiered on, returning to their patented pop-metal sound for Euphoria, which was released in June of 1999. Despite the success of \"Promises,\" the record failed to produce any additional hits, resulting in a return to adult pop balladry on 2002\\'s X. The two-disc Rock of Ages: The Definitive Collection arrived in 2005, followed in 2006 by Yeah!, a strong collection of covers. In 2008, the guys released their tenth studio album, Songs from the Sparkle Lounge, which debuted at number five and was supported by a lucrative summer tour. Material from that tour helped make up the bulk of 2011\\'s Mirror Ball: Live &amp; More, a three-disc live album containing a full concert, three new studio recordings, and DVD footage. Another live album followed two years later: Viva! Hysteria found Def Leppard running through their 1987 blockbuster in its entirety on the first disc, and a collection of early, rarely played material on the second. In 2015, the band released Def Leppard, their 11th studio album and first collection of original music since 2008. In February 2017, the group issued And There Will Be a Next Time, a live album culled from the Def Leppard supporting tour. Later that year, a Super Deluxe Edition of Hysteria came out in celebration of the record\\'s 30th anniversary. Further repackagings continued in 2018 with a box set of their \\'80s albums titled The Collection, Vol. 1 and The Story So Far: The Best of Def Leppard, a multi-disc set that included the band\\'s first four studio albums and various rarities. The next year saw the release of The Collection, Vol. 2, a set of their \\'90s records, and The Story So Far, Vol. 2: Hits &amp; B-Sides, which picked up where the first volume left off with material from the band\\'s \\'90s run and beyond. Def Leppard continued to tour on a regular basis and played a Las Vegas residency, then in 2020 issued a collection of their first two albums plus a live set and BBC sessions titled The Early Years 79-81. After this slew of live and reissued material, the band finally released another studio album in 2022, their 12th. Entitled Diamond Star Halos, it was heralded by the barnstorming, old-school promo track \"Kick\" and featured two collaborations with Alison Krauss. In 2023 the band issued Drastic Symphonies, a set of reimagined Lep classics and hidden gems recorded with London\\'s Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'From their humble beginnings in Belo Horizonte, Sepultura became the most successful Brazilian heavy metal band in history. Over a ten-year period, the group grew from strength to strength, transforming themselves from a primitive death metal ensemble with early recordings such as 1987\\'s Schizophrenia into one of the leading creative trendsetters of the international aggressive music scene by the time of 1989\\'s Beneath the Remains. Their reputation was cemented in 1991 with the release of Arise. Sepultura\\'s musical palette began to expand with 1993\\'s Chaos A.D., where they experimented with old-school heavy metal and groove metal. After a long tour following the release of 1996\\'s Roots, a bitter internal crisis ensued, and guitarist/vocalist Max Cavalera left; it split the band and Sepultura struggled to recover their momentum. In 1998, with American singer Derrick Greene replacing Cavalera, they issued Against and began to find their groove again. They issued six more albums before drummer Igor Cavalera left the group to reunite with his brother and form the Cavalera Conspiracy. After hiring drummer Jean Dolabella to tour in 2006, Sepultura again found their way, as evidenced by late-career triumphs like Kairos (2011), Machine Messiah (2017), and Quadra (2020). Hailing from Brazil\\'s third largest city, Belo Horizonte, Sepultura (which means \"grave\" in Portuguese) were formed in the mid-\\'80s, a period during which that country was beginning to emerge from a 20-year military dictatorship. Max Cavalera (vocals/guitar), Igor Cavalera (drums), Paulo Jr. (bass), and Jairo T. (lead guitar) had a hard time even finding rock &amp; roll albums, especially those \"socially unacceptable\" genres such as heavy metal and punk. Their early influences were Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Slayer (literally the first three records purchased by Max on a visit to the \"big city,\" São Paulo), but the band soon progressed toward a death metal sound, inspired by emerging groups such as Possessed and Death. Their drive and determination (they sang in English from day one) more than made up for their geographic isolation and inexperience, and though they were only in their teens and still learning how to play their instruments, the band quickly evolved into an underground contender. After landing a deal with independent Cogumelo Records, Sepultura recorded four songs for a split LP with fellow Brazilians Overdose. Reissued on CD and named for its first track, 1985\\'s Bestial Devastation was self-produced and recorded in just two days, and it shows. Recorded with minimal time and money in August 1986, their first full-length album, Morbid Visions, showed little improvement but contained their first hit, \"Troops of Doom,\" which attracted some media attention and convinced the group to relocate to São Paulo (Brazil\\'s largest city and financial capital) in order to further their career. They also replaced guitarist Jairo T. with São Paulo native Andreas Kisser, whose greater musical ability would help take the entire band to the next level. In 1987, Sepultura\\'s technical proficiency finally caught up with their creative vision, and their second full-length album for Cogumelo, Schizophrenia, displayed an incredible evolution in terms of production and performance. It also became a minor critical sensation across Europe and America, drawing the attention of Roadrunner Records, which promptly released the album worldwide and signed the band to a long-term contract. No longer restrained within Brazilian borders, the group set about composing 1989\\'s Beneath the Remains, the first of four albums that would solidify Sepultura\\'s position as perhaps the most important heavy metal band of the \\'90s. Recorded in Rio de Janeiro for Roadrunner under the guidance of leading death metal producer Scott Burns, 1989\\'s Beneath the Remains was an immediate critical and commercial success, and the band\\'s ferocious performances on the subsequent European tour further cemented Sepultura\\'s reputation. The group also filmed their first video, for the single \"Inner Self,\" and finished that year\\'s tour with a triumphant set of shows in their homeland. After obtaining new management and relocating to Phoenix, Arizona, Sepultura entered Tampa\\'s Morrisound Studios with producer Burns to record 1991\\'s highly acclaimed Arise album. First single \"Dead Embryonic Cells\" proved to be another resounding hit, and the title track would gain even more attention when its video was banned by MTV America due to its apocalyptic religious imagery. The world tour that followed elevated the album to platinum sales worldwide (a figure rarely achieved by bands of such an extreme nature) and, in a strange twist, found singer Max Cavalera marrying band manager Gloria Bujnowski, who was almost twice his age. Such was the group\\'s success that their label, Roadrunner, obtained a co-distribution deal with Epic Records for their next recording, 1993\\'s Chaos A.D. By incorporating social issues (especially relating to Brazil) into their lyrics, as well as displaying some of their punk and hardcore influences for the first time, the record was another worldwide smash thanks to singles like \"Territory\" and \"Refuse/Resist.\" After touring for over a year, the members of Sepultura took a well-deserved break before starting work on their most ambitious album yet, 1996\\'s Roots. The introduction of native Brazilian percussion and musical styles into their trademark downtuned guitars and increasingly sociopolitical themes resulted in a highly unique record that could loosely be described as heavy metal/world music. Roots marked Sepultura\\'s creative peak, and the group\\'s continual rise to ever-greater fame seemed guaranteed until a family tragedy set off a series of events that would break up the band. Just hours before taking the stage at England\\'s Monsters of Rock festival, the group discovered that the teenage son of manager (and singer Max\\'s wife) Gloria had been killed in a car accident. A shocked Sepultura took the stage as a trio while Max and Gloria boarded the first plane back to America. Only a few months later, the band confronted Max about severing ties with Gloria and finding new management. Still recovering from the recent trauma of a death in his extended family, Max viewed this as a huge betrayal and left the band amid much bad blood and acrimony. As the group\\'s creative leader, many expected his departure to spell the end of Sepultura, but the band announced that they would carry on and soon began looking for a replacement. After a long search, Sepultura recruited Cleveland native Derrick Green as their new singer and began laying down tracks for 1998\\'s Against. Though it retained much of the intensity and diversity of its predecessor (including a collaboration with Japan\\'s Kodo percussion ensemble on the track \"Kamaitachi\"), the album lacked the unique spark that had characterized the group\\'s prior work. It also sold only half as many copies as Cavalera\\'s first album with his new band, Soulfly, clearly showing with whom fan loyalty remained. Undaunted, Sepultura returned in early 2001 with Nation. The album followed in the footsteps of its predecessor, despite better reviews and a more seasoned Green on vocals. In order to reach out to their slowly shrinking fan base, the group released one of their last live shows with Max, Under a Pale Grey Sky, in the fall of 2002. An EP of covers, Revolusongs, was issued in 2003, followed by the full-length Roorback, 2005\\'s Live in São Paulo, 2006\\'s Dante XXI, and 2009\\'s Clockwork Orange-inspired A-Lex. The following year, Sepultura announced they had signed to Nuclear Blast, where they would release 2011\\'s Kairos (after which their drummer left) and their 13th studio album, The Mediator Between the Head and Hands Must Be the Heart, in 2013. This latter effort, inspired by the sci-fi classic Metropolis, brought an injection of fresh blood with the introduction of 20-year-old drummer Eloy Casagrande. It was produced by Ross Robinson, who had helmed their seminal album Roots. After a major tour, the reenergized band went back into the studio with Jens Bogren to record 2017\\'s Machine Messiah. They remained on the road in support of the effort until 2019, when they barreled straight into another album cycle. The band\\'s 15th effort, Quadra, was issued in February 2020 and produced by Jens Bogren. The set was a four-part concept offering centered around the quadrivium of mathematics. With its entertaining intersections of prog metal, thrash, and death metal -- sometimes within the same song -- it marked a turning point in the evolution of Sepultura\\'s sound. The following year saw the release of SepulQuarta, a collection of collaborations that featured contemporaries like Devin Townsend, Scott Ian (Anthrax), Danko Jones, and Matt Heafy (Trivium) helping to re-interpret some of Sepultura\\'s best-known tracks. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'At a time when the charts were ruled by pop-metal acts, Dokken were a major attraction throughout the 1980s. With vocalist Don Dokken\\'s captivating stage presence and guitarist George Lynch\\'s high-energy style, the band combined rockers such as \"Kiss of Death\" and power ballads such as \"Alone Again\" in order to create a number of best-selling albums. Dokken\\'s roots date back to the late \\'70s, when Lynch, along with drummer Mick Brown, teamed up with Don Dokken to form the Boyz. In 1981, Don moved to Germany and was signed to Carerre Records. The band, now simply known as Dokken, recorded and released its first studio album, Breaking the Chains, in 1983. While the record failed to achieve a decent chart position in the United States, the group was immensely popular in Europe. After a tour in Germany, Dokken were signed to Elektra Records, and Jeff Pilson became their first official bassist. In 1984, the band released Tooth and Nail, which featured the hit songs \"Into the Fire,\" \"Just Got Lucky,\" and \"Alone Again.\" With heavy MTV and radio airplay, Dokken found themselves topping the charts worldwide, and Tooth and Nail eventually sold over a million copies in the U.S. alone. Following a tour with the Scorpions, the group recorded Under Lock and Key in 1985, which had similar success due to the hits \"In My Dreams\" and \"It\\'s Not Love.\" In 1987, Dokken released Back for the Attack, which featured \"Dream Warriors,\" a track they had written as the subtitle for the third Nightmare on Elm Street film. The coinciding music video, which included scenes of the band interacting with the movie\\'s characters, was their most popular ever, and Back for the Attack became Dokken\\'s third record to reach platinum status. Their subsequent tour resulted in a live compilation, Beast from the East, which was released shortly before the band broke up in 1988 due to Don Dokken\\'s and Lynch\\'s creative differences. After the disbanding of Dokken, Don pursued a solo career with Up from the Ashes, and Lynch formed the Lynch Mob, releasing an album in 1990; both releases failed to chart. The band reunited in 1992, signing with Columbia Records and releasing 1995\\'s Dysfunctional, which was met with harsh reviews and poor sales. Tensions once again seemed to hover around Dokken as they recorded the live acoustic release One Live Night for the CMC label. In 1997, the band released Shadowlife, which was met with a similar response to their past two recordings. In 1998, Lynch left a second time to reunite the Lynch Mob, and was replaced with Winger guitarist Reb Beach for 1999\\'s Erase the Slate. This was followed in 2000 by another concert record, Live from the Sun, which captured the Beach lineup at Anaheim\\'s Sun Theater. Beach left the group and was replaced by John Norum, and the group recorded Long Way Home for release in the spring of 2002. In 2003, ex-Warlock guitarist Jonathan Levin and ex-Ted Nugent and Yngwie Malmsteen bassist Barry Sparks joined the band, resulting in the release of Hell to Pay the following year. Dokken returned to the studio in 2008 for the well-received Lightning Strikes Again, which proved to be their highest charting outing in years. Due to a scheduling conflict, 2012\\'s Broken Bones was the first Dokken release to not feature drummer and co-founder Mick Brown -- session drummer Jimmy DeGrasso filled in -- but he returned for Return to the East: Live 2016, a concert album that was released in 2018 and also included George Lynch and Jeff Pilson. ~ Barry Weber, Rovi'\n",

The group toured for a year straight in support of this successful album.The band released their next two albums \"True Self\" (2006) and \"Picture Perfect\" (2009) and proved that they were a mainstay in the Hard Rock world with non stop touring and by spawning yet another top charting hit single with \"The Lesser Man\" in 2010.SOiL released its sixth studio album, entitled \"Whole\", on August 20, 2013. The album was a \"Return to form\" for the band and has been hailed by fans and critics alike as the album that could have come directly after the \"Scars\" album. After celebrating their 20th anniversary in January of 2017, SOiL released “SCREAM: The Essentials”, a Greatest Hits collection featuring their popular songs along with special unreleased material.'\n",

      "\"GEMINI SYNDROME welcomes you to the third and final degree of your initiation into the Synner Society. 3rd Degree – The Raising, is GEMINI SYNDROME's third full length album. Following the band's 2013 debut Lux, and 2016 sophomore LP Memento Mori, this new album offers the closing chapter in a trilogy of song and narrative. This order of three steps, and three albums, is not by chance, but is a nod to many of the initiatory traditions that exist and act as a vessel for transmitting and preserving the Sacred Knowledge throughout the ages. The intention is to provoke the listener to think about the mystery of life, the nature of reality, the roles we play, and the masks we wear in this world. Wherein Lux, meaning “Light,” was concerned with birth; and Memento Mori, meaning “Remember That We Must Die,” dealt with the finite nature of life; the focus and message of 3rd Degree – The Raising, is of traversing Death, being Reborn and reintegrating with our True Self, and thus being raised into the next degree of experience.“Every quest within deserves a good soundtrack...”  — GS°\"\n",

      "'Judging from their name, Suicidal Tendencies were never afraid of a little controversy. Formed in Venice, California, during the early \\'80s, from the beginning the group\\'s leader was outspoken vocalist Mike Muir. The outfit specialized in vicious hardcore early on -- building a huge following among skateboarders and thus lending a major hand in the creation of skatepunk -- before eventually turning their focus to thrash metal. Early on, the group (whose original lineup included Muir, guitarist Grant Estes, bassist Louiche Mayorga, and drummer Amery Smith) found it increasingly difficult to book shows due to rumors of its members\\' affiliation with local gangs and consistent violence at their performances. The underground buzz regarding Suicidal grew too loud for labels to ignore, though, as the quartet signed on with the indie label Frontier; issuing Muir and company\\'s classic self-titled debut in 1983. The album quickly became the best-selling hardcore album up to that point; its best-known track, \"Institutionalized,\" was one of the first hardcore punk videos to receive substantial airplay on MTV, and was eventually used in the cult classic, Emilio Estevez movie Repo Man, as well as in an episode for the hit TV show Miami Vice (for which the group made a cameo appearance). Suicidal Tendencies proved influential for future speed/thrash metal bands, but despite their early success, their reputation preceded them, as no other record label was willing to take them on (in addition, Los Angeles banned the group from playing around this time, lasting until the early \\'90s). Not much was heard from the group for several years afterward (leading many to believe that Suicidal had broken up), but Muir and company eventually found a home with Caroline Records. By this time, half of the original lineup had left; Muir and Mayorga were the only holdovers, while guitarist Rocky George and drummer R.J. Herrera rounded out the group. The year 1987 saw the release of Suicidal\\'s sophomore release, Join the Army, which spawned another popular skatepunk anthem, \"Possessed to Skate,\" as more and more metalheads began to be spotted in Suicidal\\'s audience. Soon after, Suicidal were finally offered a major-label contract (with Epic), as another lineup change occurred: Mayorga exited the band, while newcomer Bob Heathcote took his spot, and a second guitarist, Mike Clark, was added as well. This Suicidal lineup\\'s first album together, 1988\\'s How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can\\'t Even Smile Today, showed that their transformation from hardcore to heavy metal was now complete, as did a compilation of two earlier EPs, 1989\\'s Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Déjà Vu. Suicidal\\'s first release of the new decade, 1990\\'s Lights, Camera, Revolution, was another success; its video for the explosive \"You Can\\'t Bring Me Down\" received repeated airings on MTV\\'s Headbanger\\'s Ball program, while the album (in addition to the Controlled by Hatred comp) would be certified gold in the U.S. a few years later. The release also signaled the arrival of new bassist Robert Trujillo, whose penchant for funk added a new element to the group\\'s sound. They tried to broaden their audience even further by opening a string of arena shows for prog-metallers Queensrÿche during the summer of 1991. Their next release, 1992\\'s The Art of Rebellion, proved to be one of the most musically experimental albums of their career. Muir and Trujillo also teamed up around this time for a funk-metal side project, Infectious Grooves (including several other participants, such as Jane\\'s Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins) and issued a debut release, The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move. Upset that the group\\'s classic debut had been out of print for several years by this point, Muir decided to re-record the entire record with Suicidal\\'s \\'90s lineup under the title of Still Cyco After All These Years. But after one more release, 1994\\'s Suicidal for Life, Suicidal decided to hang it up. A pair of compilations were issued in 1997: a best-of set, Prime Cuts, plus Friends &amp; Family. Muir and Trujillo continued to issue further Infectious Grooves releases (Sarsippius\\' Ark and Groove Family Cyco), in addition to Muir pursuing a solo career under the alias of Cyco Miko (Lost My Brain Once Again) and Trujillo touring and recording as part of Ozzy Osbourne\\'s solo band (appearing on Osbourne\\'s 2001 release Down to Earth). Muir formed a new version of Suicidal in the late \\'90s (with Clark being the only other familiar face), resulting in such further studio releases as 1999\\'s Freedumb and 2000\\'s Free Your Soul and Save My Mind. Muir and Trujillo joined forces once more for a fourth Infectious Grooves studio release in 2000, Mas Borracho, while another Cyco Miko release surfaced, Schizophrenic Born Again Problem Child, along with a follow-up to their earlier compilation, Friends &amp; Family, Vol. 2. Busy with myriad side projects, the band wouldn\\'t release another studio album until 2013. The aptly named 13 was recorded over a ten-year period, and would be the group\\'s only studio album with guitarist Nico Santora, bassist Steve Bruner, and drummer Eric Moore. Muir brought in guitarist Jeff Pogan, bassist Ra Díaz, and drummer Dave Lombardo for the band\\'s 12th studio long-player, 2016\\'s World Gone Mad. March 2018 saw the band issue the EP Get Your Fight On!, with plans to release a full-length outing later that summer. Late-\\'80s bassist Bob Heathcote died on July 24, 2022 in a motorbike accident; he was 58 years old. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'Hailing from Palm Desert, CA, Kyuss (pronounced \"kai-uss\") has become something like a heavy metal equivalent to the Velvet Underground. Although they are widely acknowledged as pioneers of the booming stoner rock scene of the 1990s, the band enjoyed little commercial success during their brief existence, but their combination of sludgy, down-tuned guitars (often played through a bass amp for maximum, earth-shaking intensity), spacey jams, galloping thrash metal rhythms, and organic drums became a blueprint, often copied, but never quite replicated by countless underground metal bands.Formed in 1987 by vocalist John Garcia, guitarist Josh Homme, bassist Nick Oliveri, and drummer Brant Bjork, Kyuss (previously known as Sons of Kyuss) began jamming at so-called \"desert parties,\" in and around the isolated towns of the Southern California desert. The band gradually built a local following, signed with tiny independent label Dali Records, and released their first album, Wretch, in 1991. Under-produced and poorly financed, the album failed to capture the band\\'s live sound and went mostly unnoticed until sporadic touring started earning Kyuss a reputation as a ferocious live unit, as well as the respect of many fellow musicians. One of these, Masters of Reality singer/guitarist Chris Goss, decided to produce the band\\'s next effort, and the collaboration bore fruit in 1992\\'s stunning Blues for the Red Sun. Soon hailed as a landmark by critics and fans alike, the album took the underground metal world by storm and established the signature Kyuss sound once and for all: the doom heaviness of Black Sabbath, the feedback fuzz of Blue Cheer, and the space rock of Hawkwind, infused with psychedelic flashes, massive grooves, and a surprising sensibility for punk rock, metal, and thrash.Based on this sudden surge of interest, the band was signed by Elektra Records just as Dali was about to go bankrupt, and despite the loss of bassist Oliveri (he was replaced by Scott Reeder, formerly of the Obsessed), the band continued building momentum with 1994\\'s Welcome to Sky Valley. Also recorded under Goss\\' guidance, the album nearly matched the brilliance of its predecessor and saw Kyuss taking the novel approach of grouping the songs into three extended suites. Still, despite such creative promise and an ever-growing fan base, personal strife had already begun tearing the band apart, and drummer Brant Bjork was the first to depart when they concluded their fall tour. Then, although they quickly recruited the jazz-trained Alfredo Hernandez to replace him on 1995\\'s noticeably less inspired ...And the Circus Leaves Town, a final rift between Homme and Garcia finally brought Kyuss\\' meteoric run to a disappointing halt. 2000\\'s Muchas Gracias: The Best of Kyuss collected rare outtakes and live recordings and effectively put a capper on the Kyuss legacy, but after a period of relative silence, each bandmember\\'s talent began leaving its mark on a number of relevant projects. Garcia briefly worked with straightforward desert rockers Slo Burn in 1997 before reuniting with Reeder in the much more promising (but ultimately doomed) Unida, later lending his in-demand pipes to Hermano and other bands. Brant Bjork sang and played guitar in his own power trio, Che (featuring his Kyuss replacement Hernandez on drums), and released a number of solo albums while joining top fuzz rockers Fu Manchu on a full-time basis. As for Josh Homme, discounting a short touring stint as rhythm guitarist for Screaming Trees, he initially retreated into production and spent much of the late \\'90s collaborating with an impressive array of musicians on the eclectic Desert Sessions. Some of this material was later reworked into his next major project, Queens of the Stone Age, which saw him paired with original Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri (who had kept busy working with Dwarves) and, at first, drummer Hernandez, as well. Ironically, by their third release (and last with Oliveri), 2002\\'s Songs for the Deaf, Queens of the Stone Age had achieved significantly larger sales than Kyuss ever did, though it\\'s arguable whether they\\'ve yet matched their predecessor\\'s legendary status. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'Over the course of more than a decade and increasingly accomplished albums, Chuck Schuldiner, the architect behind the ubiquitous Death, became a bona fide heavy metal icon. Now widely recognized as the father of death metal (if a single candidate must be chosen, his résumé is about as good as it gets), Schuldiner\\'s singular drive and ruthless creative vision guaranteed that Death would ever represent the cutting edge of the style\\'s development. Indeed, while the savagely raw aggression contained in Death\\'s first three albums proved crucial to spearheading the first generation of death metal bands, the astounding musicianship and increasingly sophisticated songwriting found on their later-day efforts surely influenced even more groups to explore the limits of extreme metal\\'s most progressive outposts. By all accounts a force to be reckoned with on-stage, Death also logged more frequent flier miles than perhaps any other band of their ilk, undertaking numerous far-reaching tours despite suffering from continuous and often acrimonious musician turnover within their ranks. Throughout this long journey and drastic evolutionary curve, Schuldiner was to be the only constant, the effective mastermind behind Death\\'s continually groundbreaking career, and, as proven by his near-canonization at the time of his untimely passing, arguably unequalled in stature within one of rock\\'s most uncompromising style. Death\\'s aggressive and confrontational style was introduced on their influential debut album, 1987\\'s Scream Bloody Gore, while 1991\\'s Human and 1993\\'s Individual Thought Patterns were more accomplished and precise works that captured the group at their creative peak. The story of Death begins near Orlando, Florida, circa 1984, when vocalist/guitarist Schuldiner formed a band named Mantas with guitarist Rick Rozz and drummer Kam Lee. Although they\\'d yet to finish high school, the eager teens quickly set about trying to replicate the most excessive heavy metal sounds imaginable, which they often heard on demos obtained via the bustling underground tape-trading circuit existent at the time. Many of these heavy metal sounds originated in the U.K., where bands like Iron Maiden, Angel Witch, and Venom were riding high on the New Wave of British Heavy Metal; others in continental Europe, where diabolical agents like Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer, and Bathory were sowing the seeds of black metal; and others still in the American West Coast, where young bands like Metallica, Slayer, and Exodus were redefining the genre by injecting it with unprecedented speed and energy, thus giving birth to thrash metal. All of these developments converged to spark the young Floridian\\'s excitement, and the soon-to-be rechristened Death spent the next few years refining their chops through endless, arduous rehearsals and sporadic live performances. Their hard work and perseverance finally paid off when a three-song demo tape called \"Mutilation\" began drawing rave reviews in the metal underground, soon convincing Bay Area-based thrash specialists Combat Records to sign the group. When his bandmates balked at leaving Florida to record, Schuldiner simply left them all behind (they would form a group called Massacre in his absence) and relocated to San Francisco to team up with drummer Chris Reifert (later of Autopsy infamy) and record Death\\'s now legendary debut album, Scream Bloody Gore. Released in 1987, the LP is considered death metal\\'s first archetypal document; Possessed\\'s proto-death classic Seven Churches may have predated it by almost two years, but the fact of the matter is that both were concurrent works from a demo perspective, and Scream Bloody Gore merely arrived later. Also, while Seven Churches represented something of an unplanned transition between thrash and death metal, Scream Bloody Gore more clearly defined the new offshoot\\'s true essence for the first time. Boiled down to the most basic terms, this transition simply entailed propelling thrash metal\\'s sheer speed and ferocious execution into further inaccessibility with the addition of gore-obsessed lyrics delivered via often indecipherably growled vocals. Needless to say, this unprecedented level of sonic hatred went down a storm with thousands of angry metal-loving teenagers across the world.Having set his metallic dreams (or nightmares, as it were) into motion, Schuldiner returned to Florida, where he reunited with his old chum Rick Rozz and drafted bassist Terry Butler and drummer Bill Andrews to integrate Death\\'s first touring lineup. The quartet was also soon ensconced in Tampa\\'s imminently famous Morrisound Studios with future premier death metal producer Scott Burns (lots of firsts in this story, huh?) and working on 1988\\'s sophomore Leprosy, which reprised much of the debut\\'s successful tricks without taking Death\\'s sound much farther, due in part to Rozz\\'s disinterest in doing so and his increasingly mismatched guitar style. He was soon unceremoniously ejected for his shortcomings and replaced by the far more gifted James Murphy, who would barely last a year himself before embarking on a journeyman existence that would take him to Obituary, Testament, and beyond, but nevertheless contributed stellar fretwork to 1990\\'s transitional Spiritual Healing. This album found Death beginning to relinquish some of the unrelenting velocity, mindless ferocity, and often trite blood and gore lyrics which characterized death metal\\'s infancy (grindcore\\'s fast-rising legions, led by Napalm Death and Carcass would take it from here), before diving headlong into its understandably experimental pubescent phase. In practice, this meant introducing slower rhythms, increasingly complex dynamic tempo changes, insidious melodies, and somewhat more enlightened and introspective, if no less dark and cynical, subject matter, commenting on society\\'s ills and injustices. All of these exciting developments would come to greater fruition on 1991\\'s pivotal Human LP, but, given the acrimonious conditions that had plagued the Spiritual Healing tour (Schuldiner literally went AOWL, leaving Butler and Andrews to fulfill the band\\'s extensive European engagements with the help of their roadies!), it\\'s a wonder Death survived long enough to record it. In his obsessive quest for perfection and constant evolution, the obstinate Schuldiner had once again pushed his bandmembers as far as their musical abilities could take them, thus mandating that an entirely new group of players be cast to enact the next chapter in his grand scheme. Sure enough, the sessions for Human convened a super-gifted ensemble for the ages, namely guitarist Paul Masvidal and drummer Sean Reinert of then still unsigned death/fusion sensations Cynic, and fretless Bay Area bass wonder Steve DiGiorgio, who was borrowed from Sadus for recording purposes only. This release, along with the even more commercially successful Arise by Brazilians Sepultura helped ensure that 1991 should go down as year one of death metal\\'s world saturation. At least in its original form, as hordes of gifted new upstarts such as the aforementioned Cynic and Obituary, technical demons Morbid Angel and Deicide, death/jazz experimentalists Atheist, Long Island natives Suffocation, and an entire horde of burgeoning Swedish upstarts, were even then undertaking to rewrite the rule book and challenge elder statesmen like Death for genre supremacy.Not to be outdone, Schuldiner simply upped the ante yet again, continually re-inventing his sound time and time again, even as he refused to compromise its brutal core values. As proof, both 1993\\'s Individual Thought Patterns and 1995\\'s Symbolic would continue to introduce staggering advancements into the group\\'s sound. The first took Human\\'s blinding technicality to the next level, while benefiting from the distinctive fretwork of ex-King Diamond guitarist Andy LaRocque, whose six-string duels with Schuldiner rank among the most exciting of Death\\'s long career. The second simplified song structures somewhat, but benefited from dense harmonies contributed by the less flashy, but equally effective Bobby Koelble, resulting in Death\\'s most infectiously melodic album ever. And perhaps best of all for extreme metal fans, former Dark Angel behemoth Gene Hoglan lent his inimitable percussive talents to both LP\\'s, forging an unlikely pairing with Schuldiner that remains the stuff of death metal dreams come true. Not surprisingly, this trio of albums continues to vie for fans and critics\\' hearts as Death\\'s greatest achievements. How ironic then that Schuldiner himself was beginning to grow tired of death metal\\'s much expanded framework.But that was exactly the case come 1996, by which time Death\\'s chief architect was hungry for a creative outlet in which to express his more mainstream heavy metal songwriting. Claiming his own voice as too limited for what he had in mind, Schuldiner shocked the heavy metal community by disbanding Death and announcing his plans for an entirely new band, to be named Control Denied. But the new project took longer than expected to get off the ground, so Schuldiner decided to backtrack and record one final envelope-pushing album under the Death franchise, resulting in 1998\\'s quite stellar The Sound of Perseverance. As might have been expected, he was once again backed up by an entirely new band, this time consisting of relative unknowns like guitarist Shannon Hamm, bassist Scott Clendenin, and drummer Richard Christy (later of Howard Stern fame). Following this release, Schuldiner finally felt ready to move forward with the Control Denied concept in earnest, and the new quintet (featuring many old accomplices and a full-time lead vocalist in Tim Aymar) unleashed their The Fragile Art of Existence debut in the fall of 1999. The music was certainly a departure for Death\\'s orphaned fan base, but, at least in Schuldiner\\'s eyes, everything was going to plan…until tragic fate intervened. In early 2000, Schuldiner was diagnosed with a malignant brain-stem tumor and immediately underwent emergency surgery to remove it. All musical plans were put on hold as Death\\'s mastermind fought for his life amid ever-mounting medical bills (like most professional musicians, he had no health insurance), some of which were luckily alleviated by the heavy metal community\\'s outpouring of support by way of numerous benefit concerts. Over the ensuing two years, the true state of his health was often mired in mystery, and, even though he was occasionally rumored to be on the path to recovery, all hopes were ultimately and cruelly dashed on December 13, 2001, when Chuck Schuldiner succumbed to cancer at the age of 33. Like any headstrong leader, Schuldiner\\'s tyrannical monopoly over Death\\'s brilliant career is forever guaranteed to evoke adverse opinions about his character, ranging from the resentful accusations of disgruntled former employees, to the words of loving praise of willing collaborators. But, now that the dust has settled, neither point of view matters nearly as much as Chuck Schuldiner and Death\\'s enduring recorded legacy, which will doubtless forever remain inextricably linked, synonymous even, with the death metal genre. In 2020, Relapse Records, in cooperation with the executors of Death\\'s archives, began releasing a digital series of Non:Analog -- On:Stage live albums, featuring previously unreleased recordings of concerts from throughout Death\\'s performing career. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

Upheld by head-spinning seven-string virtuosity and skyscraping melodies, the group crafted twelve no-nonsense anthems on their 2021 second full-length album, You Will Be The Death of Me [Nuclear Blast].The group shot out of the gate as a contender on their full-length debut, Revival. It bowed at #4 on the Billboard US Independent Albums Chart and at #10 on the Hard Rock Albums Chart in addition to receiving acclaim from Revolver, Outburn, and many more. “Calm Before the Storm” racked up a staggering 14.5 million Spotify streams, while “The Safety of Disbelief” remains one of SiriusXM Octane's all-time most requested songs. They toured North America and Europe with the likes of Trivium, Avatar, In Flames, Ice Nine Kills, Killswitch Engage and August Burns Red to name a few.The guys returned to Sparrow Sound in Glendale, CA in late 2019 to once again work with the production team of Josh Gilbert and Joseph McQueen [Bullet for My Valentine, As I Lay Dying, Suicide Silence].

      "\"A pioneering Swedish death metal band whose heavy thrash and melodic power helped establish the Gothenburg sound, At the Gates issued four influential albums in the '90s, including the bona fide classics Terminal Spirit Disease and Slaughter of the Soul, before ceasing operations in 1996. The group re-formed in the 2010s and took home a Swedish Grammy for their acclaimed 2014 comeback LP At War with Reality, and remained at the fore of the melodic death metal scene with subsequent efforts like To Drink from the Night Itself (2018) and The Nightmare of Being (2021). At the Gates' first lineup -- Tomas Lindberg (vocals), Anders Bjorler (guitars), Adrian Erlandsson (drums), Jonas Bjorler (bass), and Alf Svensson (guitars) -- formed in late 1990, recording the Gardens of Grief EP for the Dolores label. They toured Sweden with decibel-crushing contemporaries such as Bolt Thrower and Dismember before eventually signing to Peaceville Records, who released their The Red in the Sky Is Ours album. In 1993, they replaced Svensson with Martin Larsson on guitar, released their second album, With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness, and toured the U.K. with Anathema and Cradle of Filth.Next came their Terminal Spirit Disease LP in 1994, furthering the band's reputation with critics, who championed their fresh approach to death metal. This acclaim also led to their signing by Earache, which issued their Slaughter of the Soul album, which took a more realized approach to the melodic style of death metal the group had alluded to on previous releases. Unfortunately, just as At the Gates began to win even more acclaim -- a nomination at the Swedish Grammys, heavy rotation on MTV's Headbanger's Ball, two successful U.S. tours with Morbid Angel and Napalm Death -- the group splintered, with the Bjorler twins and Erlandsson forming the Haunted and Lindberg forming Hide.The band reunited in 2007 to play a series of shows. They continued to perform live sporadically over the next few years, but claimed they would no longer record until, in 2014, a full 19 years after the release of their last album, they announced that they would be issuing a new studio effort. At War with Reality, a concept album inspired by the literary genre of magic realism, was released in October through Century Media and was every bit as powerful as their previous releases. After extensive touring, the band took a breather that was extended by the departure of guitarist and songwriter Anders Björler in 2017. Jonas Stålhammar (Crippled Black Phoenix, the Lurking Fear) was hired as a permanent replacement. At the Gates re-assembled at Parlour Recording Studios in London with producer Russ Russell (Napalm Death, the Haunted, Dimmu Borgir) and completed their sixth full-length by year's end. To Drink from the Night Itself was announced in January of 2018 with the pre-release of the title track single and video. The album was issued in May, just prior to the band's summer tour. Their seventh album, The Nightmare of Being, followed in 2021 and featured some of their most adventurous music to date, expanding on their latter-day prog and Krautrock influences. ~ Jason Birchmeier &amp; James Christopher Monger, Rovi\"\n",

      "\"Formed in Oslo in 1991, Satyricon made an immediate and enduring impact when they emerged from the flourishing Norwegian black metal scene. Chief songwriter and vocalist Satyr and his percussive right-hand-man Frost made perpetual evolution and a noble disdain for the banality of much modern music essential tenets of their artistic approach. Having refined and redefined the second wave of black metal with early albums like Dark Medieval Times and The Shadowthrone, Satyricon screeched away from their peers in 1996 with the release of the widely acclaimed Nemesis Divina, simply one of the classic ‘90s black metal albums and a mercurial blueprint for much of what would follow. From 1999's vicious, industrial-tinged Rebel Extravaganza onwards, it was obvious that Satyr and Frost had no interest in toeing the black metal party line. Instead, via 2006's stripped down and seething Now, Diabolical and its pitch-black follow-up The Age Of Nero in 2008, Satyricon were proudly forging their own unique path, on a never-ending quest to express the inexpressible and to tap into the dark spiritual depths of 21st century humanity. By the time the band released their self-titled album in 2013, their reputation as one of modern metal's most vital, important and forward-thinking bands was way beyond dispute and routinely backed up by their unerring prowess and power as a live band.2017 sees the release of their latest and greatest musical achievement, Deep calleth upon Deep.\"\n",

      "'Saxon was one of the early leaders of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, alongside Iron Maiden and Def Leppard, even outdistancing them at the onset. Emerging in 1977, the band found commercial success with the release of their seminal sophomore effort, 1980\\'s Wheels of Steel, which went platinum in the U.K.. Subsequent efforts Strong Arm of the Law (1980), Denim and Leather (1981), and Power &amp; the Glory also did well at home, with the latter outing cracking the Billboard 200, but a series of bad decisions and bad breaks, as well as internal strife, severely stunted the band\\'s momentum toward the end of the \\'80s. Still, Saxon persevered, recording and performing consistently into the 21st century, and ultimately attaining respectability from the heavy metal community, particularly in mainland Europe. The veteran rockers released their 23rd studio album, Thunderbolt, in 2018. They also paid homage to their influences on the 2021 covers album Inspirations, before cracking the Top 20 of the U.K. charts with 2022\\'s Carpe Diem.Saxon was formed by the fusion of two bands in Barnsley, South Yorkshire in 1977 by vocalist Peter \"Biff\" Byford, guitarists Graham Oliver, and Paul Quinn, bassist Steve Dawson, and drummer Pete Gill, all of whom had been playing professionally or semi-professionally as early as 1970. Initially calling themselves Son of a Bitch, they eventually settled on the subtler Saxon moniker, but, like many aspiring British heavy metal bands of the day, the quintet found it extremely difficult to obtain a record deal in post-punk England, finally signing with the French Carrere Records. Saxon\\'s resulting, eponymous debut of 1979 was marred by a lightweight production job, but the seasoned band still managed to build a strong following by touring Britain incessantly, supporting everyone from Motörhead to Nazareth. The band would then capitalize on this exposure with its watershed sophomore effort, 1980\\'s Wheels of Steel, which boasted a much more suitable, heavier, metallic production that finally did new songs (and future standards) like \"Motorcycle Man,\" \"747 (Strangers in the Night),\" and the title track proper justice. The album was immediately heralded as a N.W.O.B.H.M. classic by fans and critics alike, and the band were apparently on their way. Saxon went on to release two more virtually flawless albums in 1980\\'s Strong Arm of the Law and 1981\\'s Denim and Leather, touring relentlessly across Britain and Europe, where Ozzy Osbourne\\'s rising Blizzard of Ozz opened for them. Not even the group\\'s lack of success in the all-important U.S. market (where Carrere\\'s distribution and promotional limitations were becoming fully exposed) and the loss of founding drummer Pete Gill (replaced by Nigel Glockler, Gill would go on to play in Motörhead) seemed capable of slowing Saxon\\'s forward momentum, and a live album, The Eagle Has Landed, was recorded in 1982 to celebrate their hot streak. Then a strange thing happened: Saxon became cold as ice. A series of admittedly less-inspired, at times repetitive albums followed in 1983\\'s Power &amp; the Glory and 1984\\'s Crusader, and the band\\'s already tenuous relationship with Carrere Records completely deteriorated because of the label\\'s inability to expand Saxon\\'s popularity, even as fellow N.W.O.B.H.M. survivors Iron Maiden and Def Leppard convincingly conquered the States. Drastic action was required, so Saxon signed a new deal with the all-powerful EMI and stepped up their game for 1985\\'s Innocence Is No Excuse, which arguably boasted the group\\'s strongest, most versatile song set in years, but not quite strong enough to break the band big, while simultaneously upsetting some die-hard fans with its slick production values (not to mention the band\\'s visual makeover, including a fancy new wardrobe, poofy perms, and lots of peroxide). The fallout of yet another commercial failure resulted in the departure of founding bassist and key songwriter Steve Dawson, and though Saxon quickly replaced him with unknown Paul Johnson, the following year\\'s scrappy back-to-basics attempt, Rock the Nations, failed to capture the metal community\\'s attention. Saxon would limp their way through the rest of the decade, gradually corroding what was left of their British and European fan base and recording an uninspired pop metal album in 1988\\'s Destiny (which featured short-lived new drummer Nigel Durham and a Christopher Cross cover) in a desperate but futile attempt to connect with American fans. By the time they returned to more aggressive heavy metal terrain in 1990 with their tenth studio album, Solid Ball of Rock (where Glockler made his return and bassist Nibbs Carter his debut), Saxon had begun to fade into obscurity. Then, having reached their lowest of lows, the members of Saxon once again proceeded to trump all expectations and stump their detractors by refusing to go quietly into the night. In fact, the extinction of the glam metal aristocracy at the hands of the grunge proletariat helped convince Saxon to drop any pretense of making it in America and return to their British metal roots. This simple realization resulted in some of the band\\'s strongest and heaviest material in ages, beginning with 1992\\'s revelatory Forever Free, growing stronger with 1995\\'s excellent Dogs of War (after which guitarist Graham Oliver tendered his resignation), and then wavering only slightly in quality -- but not in heavy metal thunder -- on albums like 1997\\'s Unleash the Beast (introducing new guitarist Doug Scarratt), and 1999\\'s Metalhead, and 2001\\'s Killing Ground (the last two recorded with German drummer Fritz Randow). The band even managed to land a new U.S. record deal with CMC International for the latter releases, and this also opened the door for Saxon\\'s first American tour -- albeit in modest-sized venues -- in almost a decade. Meanwhile, back home in England, Saxon had successfully reconnected with their aging supporters, while surprisingly growing from strength to strength in continental European countries, where they were now able to tour extensively and command huge paychecks for one-off summer festival performances. A steady flow of studio albums, including 2004\\'s Lionheart (featuring Teutonic journeyman drummer Jorg Michael), 2007\\'s The Inner Sanctum (which saw Glockler\\'s return for a third go \\'round), and 1999\\'s Into the Labyrinth, only fed into this quiet career resurgence, but this period was not without its challenges and controversies. First there was a legal battle over the band\\'s very name to contend with, when, after reconvening in 1994 to record an album under the original moniker, Son of a Bitch, former founding members Graham Oliver, Steve Dawson, and Pete Gill proceeded to start touring with a competing version of Saxon. The matter eventually went to the courts and the rebel outfit was ordered to bill themselves as Oliver/Dawson Saxon (Gill had departed by then) moving forward, which they continue doing unto the present day. Meanwhile, the \"official\" version of Saxon led by Biff Byford, Paul Quinn, et al, decided to risk some of their recovered metal credibility by pairing with reality TV producer Harvey Goldsmith for a show named Get Your Act Together. Its goal was to reintroduce the veteran group to a wider mainstream audience by way of a made-to-order single entitled \"If I Was You,\" but the experiment did not fulfill the TV show\\'s purpose, perhaps for the better. The next few years saw Saxon wresting even greater control over their own operation, and 2011 saw the independent release, not only of the band\\'s 19th studio album, Call to Arms, but also a self-produced, career-spanning documentary, Heavy Metal Thunder: The Movie. The band\\'s muscular and driving 20th album, Sacrifice, arrived in 2013, followed in 2015 by the like-minded Battering Ram. In 2016, the group headed back into the studio with producer Andy Sneap (who had worked on Battering Ram). The band\\'s 22nd album, Thunderbolt, was issued in early 2018 and featured the Lemmy tribute \"They Played Rock and Roll.\" A covers album, Inspirations, arrived in 2021, featuring alternate versions of classic tracks from the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and plenty more. They returned to original material with 2022\\'s Carpe Diem, hitting number 17 on the U.K. albums chart. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'Blending black metal\\'s most brutal tendencies, the melancholic beauty of classical and opera, and industrial metal\\'s production techniques, Dimmu Borgir have carved a niche in the metal world as one of the most savage and creative acts to hail from the Norwegian scene. Emerging in the early \\'90s -- vocalist Shagrath and rhythm guitarist Silenoz have remained the group\\'s sole constant members -- the band\\'s early material hewed closer to the thrash-forward extreme metal aesthetic of groups like Bathory and Darkthrone. Commencing with 1997\\'s Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, Dimmu Borgir\\'s purist take on black metal began to take on more symphonic undertones, culminating in the release of their landmark sixth studio effort, 2003\\'s Death Cult Armageddon, which was recorded with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Subsequent outings like In Sorte Diaboli (2007) and Eonian (2018) followed suit, with the band dressing decibel-rich, blast-furnace-forged slabs of death and destruction in black robes of Wagnerian opulence. The group first started in 1993, when members Shagrath (vocals), Erkekjetter Silenoz (guitar), and Tjodalv (guitar and drums) came together to join the emerging metal scene. Although some groups like Emperor and Mayhem had already been making noise for a while, a next generation of groups was the first to directly take influence from their efforts. Bassist Brynjard Tristan and keyboardist Stian Aarstad were drafted into the Dimmu Borgir fold and the band began its career with a 7\" single, \"Inn I Evighetens Morke.\" The single sold out in a few weeks, inspiring the band to record a full-length album. Although their live performances were starting to gain them a lot of attention, it wasn\\'t until For All Tid\\'s release in 1994 that they made their mark internationally. After some European touring and a few rave reviews from metal publications, the band went back to the studio to work on their next album. The result, 1996\\'s Stormblåst, was a step up from the primal debut album. Featuring stronger melodies and their first attempts at the classical flourishes that would enhance their later work, the group again gained more rave reviews. They were still in the shadow of many of their contemporaries, as landmark releases from Cradle of Filth and Emperor were released around the same time. They suspected their use of Norwegian may have been the cause, so Stormblast was also the last album to use their native language to deliver the lyrics. They toured quite heavily behind the album and even released a single for \"Devil\\'s Path\" in between albums, but along the way, they also lost Tristan and had to replace him with Kovenant bassist Nagash. When they did return to the studio, they recruited producer Peter Tägtgren to record the monumental Enthrone Darkness Triumphant, a landmark album in both scope and songwriting. Due to new label Nuclear Blast\\'s heavy marketing and distribution, the album sold much larger quantities than anything they had produced before, and found them thrust to the forefront of the black metal movement. Dimmu Borgir were more than ready to take that responsibility, and the following tour saw them pick up second guitarist Astennu. They also fired longtime keyboardist Aarstad because of internal difficulties and replaced him with future Sinergy frontwoman Kimberly Goss. She could only last through a part of the tour due to contract responsibilities, and she was replaced by Mustis. Tjodalv also left Dimmu Borgir after the tour to be with his newborn child, and was replaced by Aggressor for a mini-tour after taking a break from the band\\'s Enthrone promotion. For All Tid was re-released in 1998 with \"Inn I Evighetens Morke\" added to the track listing, while the Godless Savage Garden EP was also released to tide over fans until the next album. The recording sessions for Spiritual Black Dimensions came next, and Tjodalv came back to the fold after his family sabbatical. The album was released in 1999 to more praise from the metal media, as it revealed a heavier and more complex vision than anything they had accomplished before. Nagash quit before any touring could take place, but the band had asked bassist Simen Hestnaes from Borknagar to add operatic vocals to the recordings anyway, so he slid into the role quite easily. The band also made a split album with Old Man\\'s Child around the same time, and the results were released as Sons of Satan Gather for Attack in the same year. Tjodalv unexpectedly left Dimmu Borgir after their 1999 tour, but Cradle of Filth\\'s Nick Barker was more than ready to step into his shoes and the tour resumed without a hitch. In keeping with the spirit of their luck in the late \\'90s, the turn of the century saw Astennu fired from Dimmu Borgir before the recording of their next album. Financial and time constraints put off the recording process until the fall of 2000, and in the meantime, they drafted Galder from Old Man\\'s Child to become their new guitarist. Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia was the resulting album, and the effort was by far their most complicated release to date. Featuring a symphonic orchestra on almost the entire album, the CD was an astonishing accomplishment in the world of black metal. The band toured behind it, but the tragedies of September 11, 2001 cut short their plans to tour with Napalm Death in the States and they had to stay in Europe. Still, they managed to release an EP and a DVD in their newfound spare time, and Barker and Galder could do work with their various side projects and other bands before stepping back into the studio to record the mammoth genre-mashing masterpiece Death Cult Armageddon. Released in 2003, it relied heavily on the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. The year 2005 saw them issue a new version of their fan-favorite second album, re-recorded with vastly improved production values and retitled Stormblåst MMV. The full orchestra was once again utilized on 2007\\'s equally impressive In Sorte Diaboli, while 2011\\'s Abrahadabra saw them venturing even further into prog territory.The band took a long time crafting the follow-up, which was tentatively scheduled to arrive in late 2017. At the beginning of that year, to tide fans over, they released the epic live album Forces of the Northern Night, which presented in full their pivotal May 28, 2011 show from the Spektrum in Oslo, featuring the Norwegian Radio Orchestra and Schola Cantorum choir. This date was the first time they had ever been able to perform live with a full orchestra, something Shagrath called \"the pinnacle of our career so far.\" Dimmu Borgir\\'s tenth studio album, Eonian, finally arrived in May 2018. Produced by the band itself and engineered by Jens Bogren, it saw a move toward a more melodic, \"pop\"-influenced sound, albeit no less heavy or grandiose than before. ~ Bradley Torreano, Rovi'\n",

      "\"One of the first punk-metal fusion bands, Corrosion of Conformity were formed in North Carolina by guitarist Woody Weatherman during the early '80s. In their early years, C.O.C. became known for their aggressive sound, intelligent political lyrics, and willingness to break away from both hardcore and metal conventions. In the '90s, their shift to a more stripped-down, deliberate sound -- sort of Black Sabbath filtered through the Deep South -- brought them enough in line with the alt-metal Zeitgeist to bring them a measure of mainstream popularity.C.O.C. debuted in 1983 with the thrashy, Black Flag-influenced Eye for an Eye, featuring a lineup of Weatherman, drummer Reed Mullin, vocalist Eric Eycke, and bassist Mike Dean. They began to build up a cult following with 1985's Animosity, but their label at the time, Death, grew tired of their internal instability -- lineup changes found Eycke replaced by vocalist Simon Bob -- and dropped them following 1987's Technocracy. It took several years for a new lineup to come together -- featuring Weatherman, guitarist Pepper Keenan, Mullin, vocalist Karl Agell, and bassist Phil Swisher -- but when it did, the result was 1991's Blind, a powerful, focused, more metallic record that increased their audience by leaps and bounds. Agell was fired following its success, and he and Swisher went on to form Leadfoot; meanwhile, Keenan became the full-time lead vocalist on 1994's even more Sabbath-esque Deliverance, which also featured the return of original bassist Mike Dean. During 1995, Keenan took a short detour into the Southern metal supergroup Down (which also featured Pantera's Phil Anselmo and members of Crowbar). Thanks to a shift in popular taste in favor of the ultra-heavy brand of alternative metal, the group had helped pioneer, C.O.C. found themselves with a larger audience than ever before when they released 1996's Wiseblood, which continued and expanded their rock radio success. After a lengthy break from recording and a world tour with Metallica, C.O.C. returned with a new album in the fall of 2000, titled America's Volume Dealer. Another break ensued, resulting in the release of the live recording Live Volume in 2001. It wasn't until April of 2005 that the band regrouped for the hard-hitting and complex In the Arms of God. C.O.C. went on hiatus, with the members working on various side projects until 2010, when drummer Reed Mullin rejoined the band, reuniting the Animosity lineup while Pepper Keenan continued working with his other band, Down. The remaining trio began work on new material, and in 2012 released their eighth album, the eponymous Corrosion of Conformity, on Candlelight Records. Their ninth album, aptly titled IX, arrived in 2014. Shortly after the latter LP's release, C.O.C. reunited with Keenan and began work on their tenth studio long-player, No Cross No Crown, which dropped in January 2018. The band announced the death of Reed Mullin on January 27, 2020. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi\"\n",

      "'A British extreme metal institution, Cradle of Filth emerged in 1991 with a style that leaned heavily toward black metal. As the years progressed, their sound evolved as well, with elements of gothic and symphonic metal taking over, resulting in a more commercial approach that yielded internationally charting efforts like Damnation and a Day (2003), Thornography (2006), Hammer of the Witches (2015), and Existence Is Futile (2021). Cradle of Filth formed in 1991, originally comprised of vocalist Dani Filth (born Daniel Lloyd Davey), guitarist Paul Ryan, his keyboardist brother Benjamin, bassist John Richard, and drummer Darren. After recording a demo dubbed Invoking the Unclean a year later, the group recruited guitarist Robin Eaglestone, who quit soon after recording a second demo, Orgiastic Pleasures; however, when Richard exited the band a short time later, Eaglestone stepped back in to assume bass duties, opening the door for guitarist Paul Allender. Following a third demo, Total Fucking Darkness, Cradle of Filth -- with new drummer Nicholas Barker -- signed with the Cacophonous label, issuing their proper debut, The Principle of Evil Made Flesh, in mid-1994. The lineup changes continued when the Ryan brothers both departed to form the Blood Divine (and Allender left as well), making room for guitarists Stuart Antsis and Jared Demeter and keyboardist Damien Gregori to debut on the 1996 mini-LP Vempire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein. For the full-length Dusk and Her Embrace later that same year, Gian Pyres took Demeter\\'s spot, and afterward, Gregori was replaced by keyboardist Les Smith; at any rate, the album substantially expanded the group\\'s growing cult following. COF\\'s next effort, Cruelty and the Beast, appeared in 1998, amid the band\\'s steadily growing reputation for elaborate Alice Cooper/Marilyn Manson-style concert theatrics. Two years later, they returned with From the Cradle to Enslave, an EP that featured new drummer Adrian Erlandsson (formerly of Sweden\\'s At the Gates and the Haunted), as Barker had departed to join Dimmu Borgir. The band\\'s dizzying lineup changes continued apace as Paul Allender rejoined the group and Martin Powell (ex-Anathema and My Dying Bride) replaced Smith on keyboards for the full-length Midian, which was appropriately released on Halloween in 2000. Bitter Suites to Succubi was issued on Spitfire in summer 2001. The group added a choir and orchestra to the lineup for 2003\\'s Damnation and a Day on Red Ink, and moved to Roadrunner for 2004\\'s Nymphetamine. Thornography followed on Roadrunner in 2006, a year that also saw the release of The Cradle of Filth Box Set. Eleven Burial Masses, a collection of live material, arrived in 2007, followed by the concept album Godspeed on the Devil\\'s Thunder in 2008, which saw Erlandsson replaced by new drummer Martin \"Marthus\" Škaroupka.In 2010, the band left Roadrunner, signing to Peaceville in Europe and Nuclear Blast in the U.S. for the release of their ninth studio LP, Darkly, Darkly, Venus Aversa, a concept album that focused on the myth of the demon Lilith, the alleged first wife of the biblical Adam. It was the first Cradle record not to contain any instrumental tracks, and also featured the sole appearance with the band of keyboardist Ashley Ellyllon, formerly of Abigail Williams. In 2012, reduced to the trio of Filth, Allender, and Škaroupka, the group released The Manticore and Other Horrors, on which they did a bit of a turnabout, returning female vocals and hardcore punk riffs to the fore. A deluxe remastered and expanded edition of their early demo, Total Fucking Darkness, was released in May 2014; featuring additional, previously unreleased tracks, it proved a stopgap.Cradle of Filth\\'s Hammer of the Witches was announced in May 2015, marking the first new music from the group in three years -- the longest gap in their career. It featured a new lineup that included guitarists Marek Ashok Šmerda and Richard Shaw (marking a return to twin-guitar harmonies) and new keyboardist/female vocalist Lindsay Schoolcraft. The video for \"Right Wing of the Garden Triptych\" was released in May, followed by online streams of \"Deflowering the Maidenhead, Displeasuring the Goddess,\" and \"Enshrined in Crematoria\" in late June. The album arrived in mid-July. Cradle of Filth announced their 12th album, Cryptoriana: The Seductiveness of Decay, in June 2017. Produced by longtime collaborator Scott Atkins in Suffolk, the set was inspired by the Victorian obsession with death and the supernatural, and was issued in September while the band were already promoting it on tour. It would be five more years before fans saw another record from the group. Entitled Existence Is Futile and concerned with existential dread, their 13th album was released in October 2021. The preceding year\\'s COVID-19 lockdown postponed its release, allowing them longer to work on it, rewriting and restructuring their demos to produce the best work possible. Recorded once again with Atkins, it was their first to feature new keyboardist/backing vocalist Anabelle Iratni. Guitarist Stuart Antsis, who played with Cradle of Filth from 1995 to 1999, died on August 21, 2022, at the age of 48. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi'\n",

      "\"TUNGSTEN was formed in 2016 by drummer Anders Johansson (ex HAMMERFALL, ex YNGWIE J. MALMSTEEN'S RISING FORCE) after his sons Karl and Nick Johansson had let him listen to some songs they had composed together. Anders: “I really liked the songs. My sons are of course younger than me, and the songs were modern metal, like something I could never come up with. At the same time, I could hear melodies that reminded me of Nordic folk music that made me think of the past. The overall impression was catchy heavy metal with both past and future present. I asked Karl and Nick if they wanted to join me in a band and play these songs with me, and I'm happy that they accepted”. With drums (Anders), guitars (Nick) and bass (Karl), and newly composed songs, TUNGSTEN asked Mike Andersson (CLOUDSCAPE, ex PLANET ALLIANCE, FULLFORCE) to do vocals. Mike has a powerful voice and a varied style of singing and was a perfect fit to TUNGSTEN's music.\"\n",

      "'Biohazard was one of the first bands to regularly incorporate elements of both hip-hop and hardcore metal into their sound; since their lyrical fare dealt with the harshness of urban life and the resulting anger and frustration, which both genres of music have been known to address, the connection only made sense, especially in light of Anthrax\\'s highly effective collaboration with Public Enemy on 1991\\'s \"Bring the Noise.\" When Biohazard formed in 1988 in Brooklyn, New York, their sound was much closer to the former band than the latter; their original lineup consisted of guitarist/vocalist Billy Graziadei, bassist/vocalist Evan Seinfeld, guitarist Bobby Hambel, and drummer Danny Schuler. They began opening for local hardcore and thrash bands and gradually built a large following with their outraged sense of injustice, political awareness, and constant touring. A self-titled debut was released in 1990 on the Maze label, but by 1992, Biohazard\\'s fan base was strong enough to secure a deal with Roadrunner Records. Their subsequent breakthrough album, Urban Discipline, was built on the groundwork laid down by \"Bring the Noise,\" laying rhythmically shouted vocals over heavy, hip-hop-influenced beats and guitar riffs recalling both hardcore and thrash. The hardcore rap group Onyx recorded an alternate version of their hit single \"Slam\" with Biohazard backing them, and the two groups worked together again on the Judgment Night soundtrack, contributing the title song. 1994\\'s State of the World Address solidified both their reputation for intensity and their musical hybrid, but Hambel then left the band, reducing them to a trio for 1996\\'s Mata Leao, which some found the group\\'s most seamless rap/metal fusion yet. Hambel was eventually replaced by ex-Helmet guitarist Rob Echevarria, and in 1997, Biohazard released the live album No Holds Barred, which showcased the in-concert ferocity for which the group had become revered. Biohazard next signed to Mercury Records and released New World Disorder in 1999. The guys left the label following its merger with Universal and hearkened back to their D.I.Y. days with a tour of Europe and Japan without label or managerial support. The rarities collection Tales from the B-Side followed in 2001, along with their next full-length, Uncivilization. Guitarist Leo Curley exited the group following the album\\'s release. Kill or Be Killed appeared two years later and featured new axeman Carmine Vincent (ex-Nucleus), who had previously been a roadie for the band. Means to an End, Biohazard\\'s eighth and final album, was issued in August 2005 on SPV. Graziadei went on to form Suicide City with ex-members of Groovenics and Kittie. Meanwhile, Seinfeld appeared on the 2006 VH1 reality show Supergroup with Ted Nugent, Sebastian Bach, Scott Ian, and Jason Bonham. In December of 2007, a live double-disc CD and accompanying DVD titled Live in San Francisco was released, documenting one of their last shows together as a band. Biohazard\\'s classic lineup of Seinfeld, Graziadei, Schuler, and Hambel re-formed in late 2010 and recorded their first studio material in six years, Reborn in Defiance, for Nuclear Blast, which was released September of 2011. Seinfield left the group shortly after completing the album to focus on his career as an actor in pornographic films. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Formed by composer Mark Jansen after leaving @AfterForever back in 2002, Epica quickly gained attention outside their home country, taking big steps towards becoming the leading symphonic metal superpower they have long proven to be. On their past seven records so far, they soared from gothic undertones to a broad, epic and triumphant amalgamation of all things monolithic, establishing their unique brand of Simone Simons' unparalleled vocal excellence with a band both ready to tear down venues around the globe while at the same time installing orchestral splendour, progressive elegance, oriental enchantment, cinematic soundscapes and colossal fury into their trailblazing bombshell sound.For the first time in years, they congregated in a villa in the pastoral beauty of rural Holland, setting up their temporary studio in several rooms. Thus, “Omega” is an album of unity, of friendship, of the close bond the members share. And in the middle of a world in turmoil, of a cataclysmic change in society, Epica somehow managed to create their most spectacular album yet. An album that is seamlessly bringing together metal and orchestra, choir and oriental instruments to a perfect storm constantly emitting goose bumps. Add to that specifically written suites for orchestra and choir, a wide range of ethnic instruments recorded around the world by some of the best native musicians out there and you get something like the ultimate Epica album you never dared dream of.\"\n",

      "\"Danish band featuring vocalist King Diamond, guitarists Hank Shermann and Michael Denner, bassist Timi Hansen, and drummer Kim Ruzz. Mercyful Fate won a large cult following thanks to their dramatic lyrics, showing a Gothic obsession with evil and the occult, and Diamond's amazing vocal range, which shifted from a low growl to a banshee scream, plus the interplay of Shermann and Denner. The band broke up after two full-length albums owing to differences of opinion about what direction the group should take (Shermann wanted a more commercial approach). Diamond pursued a solo career in the mid-'80s. In 1993, the group reformed its original lineup, with the exception of Ruzz (King Diamond drummer Snowy Shaw joined instead). The initial results were quite successful, as the group seemed to pick up right where it left off, much to the delight of their fans. Hansen left after the first reunion record, In the Shadows, and was replaced by Sharlee D'Angelo on its 1994 follow-up Time; drummer Shaw's place was taken by Bjarne T. Holm for 1996's Into the Unknown. Dead Again followed in 1998, as did further lineup shifts; original member Denner called it quits, and the band recruited Mike Wead to take his place on guitar.

      "'Since their formation in 1993, Finland\\'s Children of Bodom wove various strains of heavy and extreme metal, melodic hooks, a flashy presentation, a healthy -- some would say excessive -- sense of humor, and the guitar pyrotechnics of lead guitarist Alexi Laiho into an instantly recognizable sound at once expansive yet difficult to pigeonhole. Beginning with their independently issued debut, Something Wild, on Spinefarm in 1997 (re-released by Nuclear Blast a year later) and underscored by an electrifying, wildly energetic, entertaining stage presence showcased on regional tours opening for acts such as Dimmu Borgir, word of mouth won the band a cult-like fan base that grew exponentially in the ensuing years, making them a global attraction. Several of their albums charted inside the Top 100 on the pop charts, while six more landed in the Top 20 at Hard Rock Albums list and on various other charts. 2003\\'s Hate Crew Deathroll delivered an excellent example of their slice \\'n\\' dice songwriting style, where grotesque, theatrical lyrics were juxtaposed with Laiho\\'s richly combinative, shred-and-roll metal riffs and themes, which simultaneously offered ample evidence of their instrumental prowess and a firmly tongue-in-cheek, nearly satirical approach to HM themes. 2004\\'s Are You Dead Yet? and 2006\\'s audiovisual package Chaos Ridden Years: Stockholm Knockout Live were paramount in winning Laiho Metal Hammer\\'s World\\'s Best Guitarist designation for the year. 2008\\'s Blooddrunk reached the Top 25, making it their highest-charting and best-selling album; its cover version of \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" became a streaming hit. In 2013, Halo of Blood was noteworthy for not only charting but for reviews by several publications that claimed it might be the recording to take European death metal mainstream. Two years later, I Worship Chaos was released in a deluxe version that contained four covers including Bananarama\\'s \"Cruel Summer,\" the Plasmatics\\' \"Mistress of Taboo,\" Kenny Loggins\\' \"Danger Zone,\" and Amorphis\\' \"Black Winter Day.\" They helped take the album to number one at home and into the upper half of the Top 200 in the States, while charting inside the Top 40 across the remainder of Europe.Founded by lifelong friends Alexi Laiho (guitar/vocals) and Jaska Raatikainen (drums), the band originally formed under the name Inearthed. Along with bassist Samuli Miettinen, Laiho and Raatikainen mined their love of classic death metal for inspiration, channeling the aggression of bands like Entombed and Obituary into their sound. Though he was Inearthed\\'s primary songwriter, Miettinen\\'s time in the band was cut short when his family moved to the United States. The group soldiered on, recruiting Henkka Seppälä as a replacement, as well as expanding their lineup with a second guitarist, Alexander Kuoppala, and keyboardist Janne Wirman. In 1997, after years of unsuccessfully courting labels with demo recordings, the band gained the attention of Belgian label Shiver, which signed the group with the intent to release their debut album, Something Wild. Inearthed quickly found their cup running over with interest when, right after they signed on with one label, a bigger label, Spinefarm Records, also became interested in the band. They eventually decided to go with Spinefarm, and changed their name from Inearthed to Children of Bodom (based on the Lake Bodom murders in their hometown of Espoo) so they could sign a new contract with the label, which eventually released their debut later that year. Things took off quickly for Children of Bodom, who entered into a relentless European touring and recording schedule that resulted in the quick release of their second album, Hatebreeder, in 1999 and their third album, Follow the Reaper, the next year. The group had a big year in 2003 when, after releasing Hate Crew Deathroll, they were named Finnish Band of the Year at the Finnish Music Awards. This was also the year of their first world tour, though the tour would prove to be a double-edged sword when, despite gaining them exposure in North America, it resulted in the unexpected departure of Kuoppala, who found himself growing tired of a life spent on the road. The band recruited guitarist Roope Latvala, who was already well known as a founding member of Stone, to replace him, and continued to tour. Children of Bodom\\'s next album, Are You Dead Yet?, arrived in 2005, though the touring was cut short after Laiho injured his shoulder a couple of years later, forcing the band off the road while the guitarist recovered. This didn\\'t stop them from working on new material, however, and their sixth album, Blooddrunk, appeared in 2008, followed by Relentless, Reckless Forever in 2011 and Halo of Blood in 2013. The group supported the release by appearing on that year\\'s Mayhem Festival tour with Rob Zombie, Amon Amarth, and Mastodon.In April 2015, Children of Bodom announced a new album. A month later, their Facebook page revealed that Latvala (a member since 2003) had left the band. Eschewing a proper studio to record in an empty warehouse, the quartet -- with Laiho handling all guitar parts -- attempted to capture the ambience of their live shows on a recording. A single, \"Morrigan,\" was released on video and for digital download in September. The album, I Worship Chaos, followed in early October with the title track offered as a second single. Just in time to tour the album, they replaced Latvala with Daniel Freyberg (formerly of Norther). It would be three-and-a-half years before the band released another record, their longest gap between albums to that date. Hexed appeared in March 2019, preceded by the single \"Under Grass and Clover.\" Both catchier and more technical than previous releases, it had progressive and even jazz hints. Children of Bodom played what was billed as their final show in November 2019, and Laiho launched a new project, Bodom After Midnight. In early January 2021, the group announced that Alexi Laiho had died in late December 2020 due to long-term health issues; he was 41 years old. ~ Gregory Heaney, Rovi'\n",

And sometimes the only thing that can make a drastic shift or an ending more difficult is to see it coming. On their seventh full-length, A Eulogy For Those Still Here, Counterparts set out to capture that surreal space in-between, and in the process pushed their sound to its greatest extremes to make their most definitive statement as a band. “I think I deal with things by preparing myself for the end,” explains vocalist Brendan Murphy. “With so much of this record I'm mourning the loss of someone that's still alive or saying goodbye to something that hasn't left yet.” Murphy's preoccupation with endings reaches wide, from relationships dissolving, to friendships fading, to loved ones passing away–and even to his band. Since forming in 2007, Counterparts–made up of Murphy, guitarists Alex Re and Jesse Doreen, bassist Tyler Williams, and drummer Kyle Brownlee–have gone from the Hamilton, Ontario, underground to touring the world as hardcore heavyweights. The band convened at Graphic Nature Audio with their longtime producer/engineer, Will Putney (Knocked Loose, Every Time I Die). In addition to Putney's reliable hand at the helm, the album sees the return of Doreen and Re. The result feels like Counterparts have honed every element of their sound into its sharpest point, resulting in 11 of their most viscerally compelling songs to date.\"\n",

The album expands on the dynamic extremes of their 2017 debut, Misery Sermon — pairing Alex's dark, cathartic lyrics with Simmons' pummeling riffs and tense, cinematic solos. “We wanted to make each song for us stand out in a different way,” the guitarist says. “On some of the songs, we focused on wanting to keep it uptempo, building to a breakdown as the focal point. Other songs it was about groove or the chorus — ‘how can we make this melodic?' The albums we love the most have those dynamics, and we want to use them to make each part hit harder.”The songs evolved over several years, the first demos constructed shortly before the release of Misery Sermon. And they finally finished the material in late 2020, with everyone (Alex, Simmons, bassist Mikhail Petrov, guitarist Dmitry Mamedov) having tracked their respective parts at home. (Evgeny Novikov recorded his drums at a nearby studio in Moscow.) Alex's words — largely sung in Russian, with occasional bursts of English — are also more balanced than the bleak song titles may suggest. “The lyrics,” Simmons says, “are quite personal to anyone who listens, I think — of personal struggle, keeping a positive mental attitude and going through the shit to have a better life and achieve your goals.”\"\n",

Inspired by the greats of the Swedish and Florida scenes, Bloodbath pooled their talents and discovered that they were more than equal to the achievements of the genre's revered ancient gods. Kicking off with the release of Breeding Death at the turn of the century, the Swedes have since evolved and mutated multiple times, releasing a succession of peerless, face-ripping death metal masterpieces. Whether fronted by Åkerfeldt or by Hypocrisy's Peter Tägtgren, Bloodbath steadily became a revered benchmark for deathly, old school evangelism. In 2014, Bloodbath unveiled a new frontman in legendary Paradise Lost vocalist Nick Holmes. Darker and nastier than any previous record, Grand Morbid Funeral was a masterpiece, and a new era had begun.

Further, Frank Mullen, the group\\'s vocalist, is considered one of the genre\\'s most emblematic frontmen; he was one of the first singers to employ the very deep \"death growl\" style. After several demos and singles, 1991\\'s now-classic Effigy of the Forgotten influenced an entire generation in death metal and grindcore circles.

The group\\'s 1991 debut album, Effigy of the Forgotten, became quite influential in the grind/death metal community. Released on Roadrunner Records, it was followed two years later by Breeding of the Spawn. After the release of the Human Waste EP, Smith left Suffocation and was replaced by drummer Doug Bohn. By 1995, the second lineup had issued their first album, Pierced from Within. The band broke up soon after, disheartened by label problems and lack of direction. A mystery album, Despise the Sun, floated around due to record label politics until Relapse finally released it in the summer of 2002. The band re-formed in late 2003 to begin working on their fourth studio album. The resulting Souls to Deny, which marked the return of original drummer Mike Smith, arrived the following year, effectively ending the group\\'s hiatus. Suffocation\\'s eponymous fifth outing saw release in 2006, and was followed in 2009 by Blood Oath; it was the band\\'s first official entry on the Billboard charts, peaking at number two on the Heatseekers chart and at 135 in the Top 200.

Though they\\'ve endured lineup changes, three of its original members -- drummer Don Hardy, vocalist Tom Hardy, and guitarist Trevor Peres -- have been aboard since 1986. Their early sound juxtaposed lo-fi death metal and hardcore, while Hardy\\'s vocals, though screamed, were readily decipherable -- this is no longer true and lyric sheets are necessary. Early albums including 1989\\'s Slowly We Rot and 1990\\'s Cause of Death embodied the chug and burn aesthetic. Following the release of 1997\\'s Back from the Dead, they split for several years. In 2004, a reunited quintet recorded Frozen in Time. Xecutioner\\'s Return followed in 2007 to glowing reviews internationally. Darkest Day appeared in 2009. The band issued Inked in Blood in 2014 and Obituary in 2017. Three live albums and the single \"A Dying World\" were released between 2020 and 2022. In January 2023 the full-length Dying of Everything was released by Relapse.Possessed and Death may have brought death metal to life, but it was Obituary who brought it to fruition. After releasing some demos as Xecutioner as far back as 1986, the five-man band -- the Hardy Brothers, Peres, guitarist Allen West and bassist Daniel Tucker -- debuted as Obituary in 1989 with Slowly We Rot; the album is a landmark in the evolution of death metal. Previous forays into the genre -- primarily by the above-mentioned bands along with grindcore innovators Repulsion and Napalm Death -- were exercises in relentlessness. These bands took the breakneck abandon of Slayer\\'s Reign in Blood one step further to the point of sheer musical excess and abandon. Obituary, on the other hand, varied their tempo considerably -- and did so at the absolute height of speed metal. Yes, the band could play at breakneck speed, but within the same song, guitarists Allen West and Trevor Peres could slow the tempo down to dirge-like levels at a moment\\'s notice, all the while keeping the music heavy as hell thanks to downtuned guitars and the snarling vocals of John Tardy. As a result, Slowly We Rot made quite a splash back in 1989, influencing an entire legion of death metal bands in Florida: Morbid Angel, Deicide, Malevolent Creation, Cannibal Corpse, and numerous others now forgotten among the thousands of international bands that followed. In a way, Slowly We Rot was the prototypical death metal album, establishing a template that would come to define the style (one that is distinct from grindcore and black metal, it should be pointed out).A few albums followed -- Cause of Death (1990) and The End Complete (1992), also proved influential -- but following the tepid reviews that greeted 1994\\'s World Demise and 1997\\'s Back from the Dead, Obituary, who toured exhaustively for four years, had exhausted themselves physically and creatively. They splintered, reuniting now and then for one-off shows. Yet even as the bandmembers went their separate ways (most notably West going on to much success as the guitarist in Six Feet Under), Obituary continued to stand tall as one of, if not the definitive death metal band.Roadrunner, the band\\'s label, issued the live album Dead and Anthology in 2001 furthering the rumor that the band was gone for good. The two-fer Slowly We Rot/Cause of Death was released in 2003.Fans didn\\'t know it, but Obituary was actually in the studio recording with new bassist Frank Watkins. The fruit of these sessions yielded 2005\\'s Frozen in Time. The universally acclaimed Xecutioners Return followed two years later, and was recorded without guitarist West (whose alcohol and drug problems led to his being replaced temporarily by Ralph Santolla of Millennium and Deicide fame).Darkest Day followed in 2009, also on Candlelight. Both Santolla and longtime bassist Frank Watkins (the latter of whom passed away in 2015 from cancer) left not long after, and in 2014 the band released its crowdfunded ninth album Inked in Blood. It was the first Obituary album to feature new guitarist Kenny Andrews and bassist Terry Butler on bass. The album performed surprisingly well commercially, resulting in Obituary\\'s first appearance on the U.S. album charts. Two years later, the band issued Ten Thousand Ways to Die, that included two new studio singles alongside a dozen live tracks. In 2017, the single \"No,\" and the two-fer compiling Inked in Blood/Ten Thousand Ways both appeared just ahead of the band\\'s tenth studio album, Obituary, in 2017. The self-titled record drew widespread acclaim, with many critics noting a sense of renewed life in the band. It was their second offering in a row to crack the Top 200 in the U.S.; it also made the Top 40 in six additional countries. The band toured relentlessly for more than two years, and were forced off the road by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The independent Taurus label released the archival Torture Chamber (Live 1992) later that year. In 2022, the band signed with Relapse that issued the live offerings Cause of Death: Live Infection, and Slowly We Rot: Live &amp; Rotting in preparation for the January 2023 release of Dying of Everything. Its cover painting was created by renowned Polish artist Mariusz Lewandowski, who had died the preceding July. ~ Jason Birchmeier &amp;'\n",

      "'Violence Unimagined. The title tells you everything you need to know about Cannibal Corpse\\'s fifteenth hellish opus. Comprised of eleven tracks, it is state of the art death metal played with passion and breathless precision, making for another flawless addition to what is inarguably one of the premier catalogues the genre has thrown up. While they continue to do what they do with aplomb, the one substantial change to Cannibal Corpse in 2020 is the addition of guitarist Erik Rutan to their ranks, joining Webster, founding drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz, guitarist Rob Barrett and vocalist George \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher. Known for his roles in Morbid Angel, Ripping Corpse and most notably fronting the mighty Hate Eternal, Rutan has long established himself as one of the most dynamic forces in contemporary death metal. Simultaneously, he has built up a reputation as one of the most in demand producers in metal, having previously produced four Cannibal Corpse albums, alongside the likes of Goatwhore, Soilent Green and Belphegor. Filling in live on guitar since 2019, in 2020 he became a full member, contributing to the writing process. And it would not be a Cannibal Corpse album without striking artwork from Vince Locke, and Violence Unimagined is no different - this time, the cover featuring a mother eating her own baby, though Webster concedes that for censorship reasons, they have had Locke do a complimentary piece that will be more widely released.'\n",

      "\"Groups like Venom, Mercyful Fate, and Slayer may have founded death metal in the early '80s, but it wasn't until such disciples as Morbid Angel came along at the close of the decade that the genre was pushed to its most extreme level, both musically and lyrically. Formed in 1983 in Florida, Morbid Angel (along with Death) would also help spearhead an eventual death metal movement in their home state, which would include such notables as Deicide and Obituary, among countless others. From its inception, the group's leader has been guitarist/songwriter Trey Azagthoth, who has successfully maintained that Morbid Angel stick to their guns throughout countless musical fads during their career. Over the course of their first few releases, 1989's Altars of Madness and 1991's Blessed Are the Sick (the latter considered by many as a landmark release in the death metal genre), the group's lineup consisted of Azagthoth, vocalist/bassist David Vincent, guitarist Richard Brunelle, and drummer Pete Sandoval. With Brunelle bowing out of the group shortly thereafter and replaced by Erik Rutan, Morbid Angel had come across what would become the longest-lasting lineup of their career, showcased on such albums as 1991's Abominations of Desolation, 1993's Covenant, 1995's Domination, and 1996's in-concert Entangled in Chaos, before Vincent jumped ship and was replaced with Steve Tucker. The Tucker-led lineup lasted for a pair of releases, 1997's Formulas Fatal to the Flesh and 2000's Gateways to Annihilation, before he was replaced with former Hate Eternal vocalist/bassist Jared Anderson. Morbid Angel spent the summer of 2001 touring U.S. arenas along with Pantera and Slayer as part of the multi-band Extreme Steel Tour. After briefly rejoining the band and recording their seventh studio album, Heretic, Tucker left again to be replaced by Vincent. Although the band continued to tour, with multiple lineup changes, a new record didn't materialize until 2011. Illud Divinum Insanus was released through the independent French label Season of Mist, and was the only one to feature Vincent following his return in 2004.After another lengthy gap in recording -- and the news in 2015 that Vincent had once again left the band -- Tucker rejoined Morbid Angel. Although they intended to tour in 2017, they were forced to cancel their booked shows due to passport issues. Eager to fix the problem, Morbid Angel planned to reschedule the tour for 2018, and in the meantime released their ninth studio record, Kingdoms Disdained, in December 2017. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi\"\n",

      "'With the release of 1990\\'s Left Hand Path, Scandinavia\\'s Entombed helped pioneer Europe\\'s death metal uprising alongside other \"big four\" bands Dismember, Grave, and Unleashed. The band\\'s trademark buzzsaw guitar sound was created using a Peavey amplifier and a Boss Heavy Metal distortion pedal. Entombed doubled down on the thrash-heavy Clandestine in 1991. Since then, Entombed have undergone many personnel changes and sonic evolutions. 1993\\'s Wolverine Blues offered a riff- and groove-heavy approach that folded hard rock into heavy metal; the band called it \"death \\'n\\' roll.\" 1997\\'s Same Difference went further, adding alt-metal to the mix, while 2000\\'s Uprising returned to a rawer sound before the band got experimental on 2001\\'s Morning Star. Following 2003\\'s Inferno, Entombed released the live Unreal Estate. 2007\\'s Serpent Saints: The Ten Amendments, was the band\\'s final album before a 2013 split. After litigation, they returned as Entombed and Entombed A.D. While the latter issued three albums before splitting in 2020, Entombed released only a handful of singles and a live re-recording of Clandestine in 2019.The roots of Entombed lie in the band Nihilist, which was formed in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1987 by drummer/guitarist Nicke Andersson, guitarist Alex Hellid, and guitarist/bassist Leif \"Leffe\" Cuzner (each was around 15 years old). Nihilist recorded a number of demos between 1988 and 1989 (i.e., Premature Autopsy, Only Shreds Remain, Drowned ), all of which were compiled, along with session recordings, and released by Threeman in 2005 as Nihilist [1987-1989]), and these recordings included additional members in vocalist Lars-Göran Petrov (aka L.G. Petrov), guitarist Ulf \"Uffe\" Cederlund, and bassist Johnny Hedlund. Of particular note, the Only Shreds Remain demo, recorded over the course of two days in December 1988 at Sunlight Studios in Stockholm with producer Tomas Skogsberg, was perhaps the first death metal recording from Scandinavia to circulate widely among the underground metal tape-trading network that at the time was comprised almost exclusively of British and American bands. While opening for the Lee Dorian-fronted lineup of Napalm Death in Stockholm, Nihilist gave one of their demo tapes to a representative of Earache Records. Impressed, the label later offered the band a recording contract. Meanwhile, bassist Johnny Hedlund left Nihilist after the Drowned demo in August 1989, subsequently forming Unleashed, another Scandinavian metal pioneer. Guitarist/bassist Leif Cuzner had previously left the band when his family moved to Canada. Nihilist disbanded after Hedlund\\'s departure; with little hesitation, however, the remaining members -- Andersson (drums), Hellid (guitar), Cederlund (guitar), and Petrov (vocals) -- then chose to re-form as Entombed. With bassist David Blomqvist taking the place of Hedlund, the rejuvenated band returned to Sunlight Studios and recorded the But Life Goes On demo on September 23, 1989, once again working with producer Tomas Skogsberg. Shortly thereafter, Entombed was back at Sunlight working with Skogsberg, this time on their debut album for Earache, Left Hand Path (1990), which was comprised largely of reworked Nihilist songs. Bassist Lars Rosenberg joined the lineup after the completion of the album, on which Andersson and Cederlund were co-credited with bass. Of greater consequence, vocalist Lars-Göran Petrov left the band. Entombed in turn recruited Orvar Säfström of the band Nirvana 2002 to sing on Crawl (1990), a three-song EP. However, when it came time to record Clandestine (1991), Entombed\\'s second album, drummer Nicke Andersson assumed the vocal duties and wrote the bulk of the album, earning solo or co-credit for each song. For purposes of touring, the band recruited another vocalist, former Carnage bassist Johnny Dordevic. Yet by the time Entombed embarked on the Gods of Grind tour (a showcase of Earache bands that also included Carcass, Cathedral, and Confessor) in the fall of 1991, Petrov had reclaimed his membership as the band\\'s vocalist.With Petrov back in the lineup, the high-profile Gods of Grind tour behind them, and two acclaimed albums to their name, Entombed went about working on their third album, Wolverine Blues (1993). Once again written largely by Andersson, Wolverine Blues proved a significant departure from Entombed\\'s previous efforts. For one, the band scaled back the velocity of their music, from the breakneck tempo shifts of their prior material (à la death metal) to a crushing midtempo groove (à la Pantera circa Vulgar Display of Power). Secondly, the band adopted more traditional verse-chorus-verse songwriting structures with memorable hooks, and the vocals were comprehensible. These changes clearly set Entombed apart from their death metal peers, but the absolutely brutal delivery of the music, especially the signature buzzsaw guitars and Petrov\\'s menacing vocals (more yelling than growling), also set the band apart from the mainstream. Moreover, Earache had aligned itself with Columbia Records, a partnership that provided indie cred with major-label distribution. The six-track Hollowman EP (1993) was the first Entombed release to benefit from the Earache/Columbia partnership; featuring an instrumental version of \"Wolverine Blues,\" the EP drummed up significant interest in the forthcoming album. Released in two versions -- one a Marvel Comics promotion featuring Wolverine from X-Men -- Wolverine Blues sharply divided fans upon its release. Death metal purists abhorred the stylistic change in direction, while other fans were pleased to see the band push forward creatively into fresh territory, especially now that a legion of similar-sounding death metal bands had arisen in the wake of Left Hand Path. Fans remain divided over Wolverine Blues; without question, though, the greater accessibility of the music did attract a new wave of fans to Entombed, and the album is generally acknowledged as a high-water mark for the band, as it would become a regular benchmark for judging the quality of future releases.Following the release of Wolverine Blues, Entombed toured Europe with Napalm Death and released the Out of Hand single. Bassist Lars Rosenburg then left the band in 1995; Jörgen Sandström, the former bassist/vocalist of Grave, filled his slot. Among other changes, Entombed secured new management, left Earache, and signed to EastWest. Unfortunately, this new label deal didn\\'t work out; Entombed recorded a new studio album, but the label didn\\'t release it and ultimately dropped the band for business reasons. The label woes endured by Entombed ultimately motivated them to form their own Threeman Recordings, and they procured distribution deals for various regions (for instance, Music for Nations in the U.S.). To Ride, Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth, the band\\'s fourth full-length, was finally released in 1997. Earache concurrently released Entombed, a compilation of previously released non-LP material. To Ride, Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth was well-received (for example, earning a second-place vote in European magazine Metal Hammer\\'s best-of-1997 poll, as well as earning the band a slot opening for Machine Head on tour) and was fairly similar in style to Wolverine Blues, though noticeably rougher around the edges and a little less memorable in terms of songwriting. Andersson, the band\\'s drummer and primary songwriter, left Entombed at this juncture, choosing to dedicate himself full-time to his other band, the Hellacopters, which was considerably acclaimed at the time. Drummer Peter Stjärnvind was brought in almost immediately for touring commitments, and stayed well into 1998 (including for the band\\'s first North American dates since the Gods of Grind tour in 1991). Upon the completion of touring, Entombed worked with producer Daniel Rey on Same Difference (1999); not only was it the band\\'s first album without Andersson\\'s songwriting, but it was their first without Tomas Skogsberg\\'s production. Largely written by guitarist Uffe Cederlund, Same Difference was a clear departure for them, taking them much further away from their death metal roots than Wolverine Blues had. Whereas Wolverine Blues had divided fans, Same Difference reunited them in disregard, if not outright disdain. Earache once again released a back-catalog item concurrently, in this case Monkey Puss: Live in London (1999), a CD/DVD recording of Entombed from the European leg of the Gods of Grind tour circa March 1992. An EP of covers, Black Juju (1999), was also released around this time, as Entombed returned to the road, touring with Meshuggah and Skinlab, respectively.To the relief of many fans and the praise of critics, Uprising (1999) signaled a return to form for Entombed, who recorded and mixed the purposefully raw album with producer Nico Elgstrand over the course of only 18 days. A tour of Europe and Canada in support of Iron Maiden followed, along with solo dates. Deemed a classic in some corners, Morning Star (2001) was a similarly raw-sounding effort, though considerably more dynamic in terms of tempo and mood; some likened it to the work of prime-era Slayer. In commemoration of Entombed\\'s 15th anniversary, Threeman compiled Sons of Satan Praise the Lord (2002), a double-disc covers collection that was wide-ranging in source material (from Venom to Bob Dylan). Also in 2002, Entombed performed a special concert at the Royal Swedish Opera with the Royal Ballet Ensemble; the performance was recorded and later released as Unreal Estate (2004). Co-produced by the band with Per Gunnerfeldt, Inferno (2003) was also similar in sound to Uprising and Morning Star (i.e., raw), though it too had its own peculiarities: a comparison was drawn to stoner metal by some, while others likened the rough-hewn production unfavorably to that of Metallica\\'s ill-fated St. Anger (2003). Stateside editions included a bonus EP, Averno, comprised of extra material from the Inferno sessions, along with a couple videos. Besides a lot of touring during this period, Entombed experienced another round of departures: bassist Jörgen Sandström left in January 2004, replaced by Nico Elgstrand; guitarist Uffe Cederlund left in September 2005, going unreplaced; and drummer Peter Stjärnvind left in 2006, replaced by Olle Dahlstedt. As a four-piece, Entombed released the five-song When in Sodom EP on June 6, 2006 (i.e., 6-6-6) and the Serpent Saints: The Ten Amendments LP in 2007. This pair of releases -- the first new material from Entombed in three years, and without the songwriting of Cederlund, who had written most of the band\\'s songs following the departure of Andersson -- fortunately found the band revitalized and as brutal as ever. In general, Serpent Saints was reviewed in glowing terms, with many critics declaring it on par with Uprising and Morning Star. Candlelight USA, the album\\'s stateside distributor, marketed it as \"Entombed\\'s best work since Wolverine Blues!\" In 2013, Petrov inked a deal with Century Media to record a new Entombed LP under the moniker Entombed A.D.. With the courts deciding that the band\\'s original name belonged to the band\\'s four founding members, Petrov decided to go it alone, recruiting guitarist Elgstrand, bassist Victor Brandt, and drummer Dahlstedt, who comprised most of Entombed\\'s then-recent lineup, along for the ride. Entombed A.D. released their first album under the new name, Back to the Front, in 2014. Two years later, they issued their sophomore outing under the new moniker, Dead Dawn, again via Century Media. On November 12, 2016, the original band performed their 1991 sophomore album Clandestine in its entirety for its 25th anniversary with the Malmö Symphony Orchestra &amp; Choir; the show was released in 2019 as the album Clandestine Live. L.G. Petrov died on March 7, 2021 after being diagnosed with bile duct cancer; he was 49 years old. In 2022, Entombed issued a fully remastered edition of 1997\\'s DCLXVI: To Ride, Shoot Straight and Speak the Truth! by Magnus Lindberg, with the band\\'s original sequencing restored. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

      "\"One of Britain's most consistent and enduring death metal bands, Birmingham's Bolt Thrower has weathered the best and worst of times in the extreme genre's history without ever giving in to commercial temptations, or hardly even altering its sound. The fact that they were unusually blessed with a steady lineup throughout much of their career no doubt contributed to this stability, and though they were rarely bestowed wild praise for their efforts, with most of their competitors or contemporaries either adopting other styles or long retired, Bolt Thrower has gradually established itself as one of the best death metal bands ever to emerge from England. Guitarist Gavin Ward and drummer Andy Whale formed Bolt Thrower in heavy metal's original birthing ground, the industrial city of Birmingham, England, in 1986. Taking their name from a character in one of their favorite role-playing games, Warhammer Fantasy Battle, the duo soon drafted vocalist Alan West, guitarist Barry Thompson, and bassist Jo Bench (one of the first female musicians to take part in an extreme metal group of any sort). True to form given their name, Bolt Thrower would dedicate their whole career to analyzing and dissecting all aspects of human warfare -- its history, its weapons, etc. -- and they quickly took to the road in order to perfect a brutalizing musical onslaught worthy of backing up such morbid subject matter. Despite their material's general inaccessibility, legendary BBC Radio1 DJ John Peel became an early supporter, hosting the group for various early sessions (subsequently released in 1991 with the expected Peel Sessions title) and helping to bolster their profile on their way to securing a deal with the Vinyl Solutions label. Around this time, West was replaced by the band's van driver, one Karl Willetts, who soon proved himself a more than capable successor and served as the final necessary cog in the Bolt Thrower war machine. Released in 1988 with little success, their poorly produced and somewhat tentative debut album, In Battle There Is No Law, lacked the focused ferocity yet to come, but already delved deeply into their lyrical obsessions with anything warlike. The following year, Bolt Thrower became one of the first acts to sign with on-the-rise extreme metal powerhouse Earache Records (also the home of grindcore experts Napalm Death) and 1989's Realm of Chaos fittingly saw them partnering with Games Workshop, the company responsible for the Warhammer game which had inspired their name. Boasting lyrics directly inspired by the game and featuring custom artwork provided by GWS, Realm of Chaos was a far more confident effort, and despite experiencing continued problems on the production end of things, it was clear that the band was slowly finding its identity. Bolt Thrower then joined the now-infamous Grindcrusher tour, also featuring Napalm Death, Carcass, and Morbid Angel, across the U.K., before starting work on what would become their most definitive album, 1991's Warmaster. This time, producer Colin Richardson helped the band achieve the taught, precision-filled intensity they'd been looking for all along, and the resulting LP has since come to represent Bolt Thrower's signature sound: Willetts' deeply guttural growl combined with Ward and Thompson's nearly impenetrable wall of dense guitar riffs, set to the requisite double kick drums; but interestingly, these didn't always resort to all-out speed, but rather maintained a measured, pounding pace, which was somehow even more powerful for it. Their sonic paradigm now in place, Bolt Thrower kept themselves extremely busy for the next few years, touring incessantly across the U.K. and Europe with the likes of Unleashed and Cemetary, while recording strong follow-ups like 1992's The IVth Crusade and 1994's For Victory, each of which achieved only slightly inferior results and maintained the group's gradual shift toward slower, doomier styles.Bolt Thrower's longtime stability was coming to an end, however, as vocalist Willetts and drummer Whale threw in their lot around this time, wishing to get off the road and pursue a more normal lifestyle. For their part, the remaining bandmembers were becoming increasingly protective of their art, and, convinced they weren't getting the best promotional support, parted company with Earache and signed to Metal Blade. Meanwhile, replacement musicians came and went as the group prepared new material, and repeated delays over artwork kept postponing the release of their sixth official album. By the time 1998's Mercenary finally arrived, original singer Willetts had been persuaded to return long enough to record his parts and new drummer Alex Thomas was sitting on the hot-stool; but by then, most fans had given Bolt Thrower up for dead and moved onto new bands to idolize. Perhaps reflecting the turmoil within, the record was also hardly one of their most stellar outings, and it was neatly overshadowed by former label Earache's Who Dares Wins collection of the same year. Dutch vocalist Martin VanDrunen was brought in for touring purposes, but further lineup changes preceded the recording of 2001's semi-comeback Honour Valour Pride, by which time Bolt Thrower's core lineup of Thompson, Ward, and Bench was complemented by drummer Martin Kearns and ex-Benediction singer Dave Ingram. Ingram left soon after the record's release, prompting the return of original vocalist Karl Willets. Those Once Loyal, Bolt Thrower's eighth studio album, was relased on Metal Blade in November, 2005. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia\"\n",

      "'Combining the extreme speed and nihilism of technical death metal with the mysticism and ancient melodies of Middle Eastern music, Nile emerged in the mid-\\'90s with a powerful and idiosyncratic sound that helped set them apart from their heavy metal contemporaries. Beginning with 1998\\'s Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka, Nile honed their self-proclaimed \"Ithyphallic Metal,\" releasing a string of successful outings like Those Whom the Gods Detest (2009), At the Gate of Sethu (2012), and Vile Nilotic Rights (2019), that looked to the seemingly disparate worlds of Egyptian history and H.P. Lovecraft, among others, for inspiration. Nile formed in 1993 in Greenville, South Carolina around a lineup consisting of Karl Sanders (guitar/vocals), Chief Spires (bass/vocals), and Pete Hammoura (drums). Two years later the band issued an EP, Festivals of Atonement, which led to a high-profile southwestern tour in support of Obituary, Deicide, and Broken Hope. A second EP, Ramses Bringer of War, was released in 1997 through Viscera Productions, followed in 1998 by the group\\'s first full-length effort, the Relapse Records-issued Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka. Having made the move to a more established label -- Viscera folded shortly after the release of Ramses Bringer of War -- Nile benefitted from the wider distribution, which gave them the chance to play alongside more established contemporaries like Morbid Angel and Incantation. 2000\\'s Black Seeds of Vengeance saw the band deliver their most musically and narratively complex collection of songs to date, with vocalist and guitarist Dallas Toler-Wade joining the fray and session drummer Derek Roddy filling in for Pete Hammoura, who had injured his hand while on tour -- In the Beginning, a collection of remastered, hard-to-find recordings was released later the same year. By 2002, the highly anticipated In Their Darkened Shrines had been released and the buzz around it led to a level of mainstream coverage that the band had never experienced before. Dark and cinematic, the LP incorporated elements of horror author H.P. Lovecraft\\'s short story The Nameless City and marked the studio debut of drummer Tony Laureano. Nile returned in 2005 with Annihilation of the Wicked, their first album with new drummer George Kollias and their last album on Relapse. After signing with Nuclear Blast, the band quickly followed up in 2007 with Ithyphallic before setting out across the U.S. on the Ozzfest tour, as well as touring South Africa and Europe. In 2009 Nile went back into the studio with producer Neil Kernon (Queensrÿche), and released their sixth studio album, Those Whom the Gods Detest, late that year. At the Gates of Sethu arrived in 2012 and became the group\\'s highest-charting effort to date, while 2015\\'s What Should Not Be Unearthed garnered acclaim both at home and abroad. Guitarist Toler-Wade left the fold shortly after the album\\'s release and was replaced by Brian Kingsland, who alongside new bassist Brad Parris, made his studio debut on the band\\'s ninth full-length effort, Vile Nilotic Rites, in 2019. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "\"A punishing American death metal group with a penchant for pairing uncompromising decibels with controversy, Deicide emerged in the late 1980s alongside contemporaries like Cannibal Corpse and Carcass. Based out of Tampa, Florida, the band poisoned the mainstream in 1992 with their sophomore effort Legion, which became one of the best-selling death metal LPs of the Nielsen Soundscan era. Employing a lethal mix of sonic heft and Satanism, Deicide's championing of animal sacrifices and anti-Christianity rhetoric yielded attacks from religious organizations and animal rights groups -- bomb threats from the Animal Militia culminated in an explosion at a Stockholm venue in 1992 -- and helped make them one of the more prominent social and sonic antagonizers in the '90s death metal scene. The group continued to mine the depths of depravity and despair well into the 2010s, occasionally tempering their death metal assault with forays into more melodic forms of extreme metal, which they did in the late 2000s, but 2013's In the Minds of Evil and 2018's Overtures of Blasphemy marked a return to the brutality of their Legion days. Formed in 1987 under the name Amon by guitarist Brian Hoffman, bassist/vocalist Glenn Benton, guitarist Eric Hoffman, and drummer Steve Asheim, the quartet released their first demo, Feasting the Beast, in 1987 followed by second demo, Sacrificial, in 1989. Shortly after the release of the latter, the band inked a deal with Roadrunner Records and changed their name to Deicide at the label's request. Their eponymous full-length debut dropped a year later, and featured re-recorded versions of the songs from Sacrificial, as well as two new cuts. Pugilistic in its ferocity, Deicide would go on to become one of the more revered death metal LPs of the decade. 1992's Legion saw the band upping their technical game, delivering a brutal barrage of complex riffs and intricate song structures that helped make it one of the group's most respected and profitable outings. Subsequent Roadrunner efforts like Once Upon the Cross (1995), Serpents of the Light (1997), Insineratehymn (2000), and In Torment, In Hell (2001) followed suit, but the band's relentless pace, both in the studio and on the road, eventually took its toll. By the time Deicide released Scars of the Crucifix via Earache in 2004, the band's inner turmoil had grown to match their combustive aural attack, resulting in the departures of both Hoffman brothers -- the siblings who would later re-form Amon. After cycling through potential players, the band settled on ex-Cannibal Corpse guitarist Jack Owen and six-stringer Ralph Santolla, formerly of Death and Iced Earth, both of whom made their studio debuts on the group's eighth long player, 2006's The Stench of Redemption. The LP proved to be Deicide's most successful outing to date, peaking at number 11 on the Heatseekers chart. 2008's Til Death Do Us Part saw the band experimenting with elements of doom metal, as did 2011's To Hell with God, the latter of which saw the group move from Earache to Century Media. Santolla left the fold in 2012, and was replaced by Kevin Quirion, who made his first studio appearance on 2013's In the Minds of Evil, which marked a return to the inexorable, old-school death metal attack of past outings. It would be the last Deicide album for Owen, who left in 2016. The band tapped Monstrosity guitarist Mark English for album number 12, 2018's reliably unrelenting Overtures of Blasphemy. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi\"\n",

      "\"Ferocious and uncompromising in their execution, CARCASS's ability to intricately dissect the innards of death metal, and display them for us to sonically understand has been their point of excellence for over three decades. Last December (2019) the band released their first single in over 5 years “Under The Scalpel Blade,” followed by a 4 song EP entitled Despicable (October 2020), setting a potent precedent for the full length album to come in 2021: TORN ARTERIES. With the album title itself referencing an old demo created by original drummer Ken Own back in the 80's, TORN ARTERIES sits as a bookend on the modern side of the CARCASS discography, connecting directly back to where everything began over 30 years ago. This new album presents images, lyrics, and sounds that so distinctly scream CARCASS, but ferry us into a new era of production, songwriting, and art all together. Recording and Production for TORN ARTERIES wasn't as simple as sitting down for a few weeks and knocking it all out, but rather spread out over the course of approximately 1 year bouncing back and forth between England and Sweden. Most will find that the only real struggle when indulging in TORN ARTERIES is fighting the desire to start it over the second it finishes. It covers substantial new ground for a band with such a reputation, while still retaining that addictive, time honored CARCASS sound that has come to represent the face of true death metal.\"\n",

      "\"Germany's Necrophagist are renowned for their improbably complex and instrumentally sophisticated interpretations of the necessarily brutal death metal sound, which they also see fit to adorn with lyrics steeped both in relevant social qualms and gory medical pathology. The band was formed in 1992 and is still helmed by vocalist/guitarist Muhammed Suiçmez, but its membership has otherwise remained in constant flux, and the first Necrophagist album, 1999's Onset of Putrefaction, found the man himself working solo with only a drum machine to keep him company. Needless to say, this didn't bode well for live performance, so Suiçmez proceeded to hire and fire over half a dozen sidemen for road work, before settling on guitarist Christian Münzner, bassist Stefan Fimmers, and drummer Hannes Grossman for the recording of Necrophagist's second album, Epitaph, in 2004. In spite of the connotations implied by its title, the band remained active thereafter and in 2009 featured Suiçmez, Fimmers, guitarist Sami Raatikainen, and drummer Romain Goulon, but has yet to record again. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Though forever doomed, commercially speaking, by their controversial name, Maryland\\'s Dying Fetus endured beyond most observers\\' wildest expectations. Formed in the waning days of death metal\\'s glorious heyday (1991, to be exact) by John Gallagher (guitar/vocals), Nick Speleos (guitar), Brian Latta (guitar), Jason Netherton (bass), and Kevin Talley (drums), Dying Fetus combined their death metal with hardcore influences in order to develop their own form of American grindcore. But while pioneering bands like Napalm Death and Carcass had taken the U.K. and Europe by storm, this subgenre never really caught on in America, and had been utterly buried by grunge by the time Dying Fetus released their 1995 debut, Infatuation with Malevolence, which, admittedly did little more than collect their old demos into a single package. After downsizing to a quartet with Speleos\\' departure, the band truly began to hit its stride with a slew of increasingly confident and inspired releases, including 1996\\'s Purification Through Violence, 1998\\'s Killing on Adrenaline, and 2000\\'s Destroy the Opposition. All the while, their notoriety continued to grow steadily within the extreme metal underground, as did their audience, thanks to a ferocious live presence and incessant touring at home and abroad with similarly aggressive bands like Kataklysm, the Crown, and Behemoth. Between road jaunts, the band kept itself busy by re-releasing an expanded version of its debut in 1999 and the Grotesque Impalement EP in 2000, but trouble was just around the corner. Midway through 2001, Gallagher was handed resignation letters from the other members of the group, who proceeded to join forces in a new project called Misery Index, and thus left the future of Dying Fetus very much in doubt. But to everyone\\'s surprise, Gallagher wasted no time hiring an entirely new lineup consisting of vocalist Vince Matthews, guitarist Mike Kimball, bassist Sean Beasely, and drummer Erik Sayenga. A new single entitled \"Vengeance Unleashed\" was recorded to support the band\\'s touring commitments, which included that year\\'s Wacken Open Air Festival, after which Dying Fetus entered the studio to prepare their fifth album, 2003\\'s eagerly awaited Stop at Nothing. The blistering War of Attrition appeared in 2007, followed three years later by Descend into Depravity -- both of them on Relapse. Arriving in 2012, Reign Supreme became their first to reach the main Billboard album charts.

      "\"Though many bands have tried, no one articulates the real apocalypse humanity is facing as vividly and succinctly as Cattle Decapitation. With 2019's Death Atlas they reached the apex of this, perhaps leading some to believe they had no place left to go beyond such an achievement, but now they return with Terrasite, which is as bold a statement as they have ever made. As such, Terrasite pushes their sound further into more epic and varied territory, and in the hands of vocalist Travis Ryan the governing concept takes a new and disturbing direction. “I wanted to do the 180° opposite of Death Atlas. Since Death Atlas was so dark and brooding, I wanted this to take place in the daylight. I've always found daytime horror to be really unsettling, which also finds its place within the lyrics.” The title is a word invented by Ryan that brings together ‘Terra-' meaning earth and ‘-site' derived from the Greek word ‘-sitos' which means ‘food'. “The combination of the two meaning ‘earth-eater', as a metaphor for humanity's role in the destruction of the planet, and is a play-on-words of the very fitting word ‘parasite'.” This is vividly brought to life in the artwork by longtime collaborator Wes Benscoter. “We see the nymph stage of this human/cockroach hybrid that is more of a fully grown being that has just molted from its ootheca stage, startled, confused, frightened but also pissed off and ready to join the rest of its brood in finishing humanity's job of destroying the Earth.”\"\n",

      "'Longtime proponents of the grinding, powerful sound of no-frills Swedish death metal, Dismember was originally formed in Stockholm in 1988 as a power trio featuring vocalist/bassist Robert Sennebäck, guitarist David Blomqvist, and drummer Fred Estby. The group recorded a couple of demo tapes, but went on hiatus in late 1989 when Estby left to join Carnage; Blomqvist played with Entombed as a bassist, then joined Carnage as a second guitarist during the recording of their 1991 debut. However, Carnage imploded when guitarist Michael Amott departed to join Carcass, so Blomqvist, Estby, and Carnage vocalist Matti Karki reconvened Dismember and recorded a demo early in 1991. Sennebäck returned a short time later, and new bassist Richard Cabeza (formerly of Carbonized) was also added to the lineup. Dismember signed with Nuclear Blast and issued their debut album, Like an Ever Flowing Stream, in May 1991. The band toured heavily behind the record, also releasing a five-track EP titled Pieces in 1992; that same year, Dismember successfully defended themselves from an obscenity charge in the U.K. stemming from the song \"Skin Her Alive.\" The experience informed the graphic Indecent and Obscene, which was released in 1993 and displayed a partial move toward melodicism, although Dismember\\'s sound still echoed the unearthly heaviness of early Entombed. 1995\\'s Massive Killing Capacity continued to refine the group\\'s style, and helped make the band more visible in the death metal underground. 1997\\'s Death Metal made clear that Dismember\\'s basic Swedish death sound wasn\\'t going to be altered all that much.

Quickly building on this with death/doom juggernaut “Above the Weeping World” (2006) or melancholic masterpiece “One for Sorrow” (2012), the Finns surprised everyone with their achingly forlorn “Argent Moon” EP in 2021, only to shed their skin once more. “If someone thought that we have grown soft with the Argent Moon EP, I think ‘Anno 1696' shows that there is the same old spirit left.”Mixed by Jaime Gomez Arellano and mastered by Tony Lindgren, “Anno 1696” is by far their most emotionally rattling achievement. Insomnium take us into a world woven of sorrow and crumbling vestiges of hope, deliver an album relying on the strengths of their beloved trademark sounds and a new sense of grandiose, melancholic storytelling.

      "\"Dark Tranquillity is one of the original and most influential melodic death bands to emerge from Sweden in the early 1990s; along with In Flames and At the Gates, they essentially created the explosive subgenre that combined death metal's intensity, progressive, and Gothic experimentation with hooky, melodic, groove-oriented riffs and twin-guitar lead lines. Dark Tranquillity were one of its earliest and most prominent practitioners, as evidenced by their 1993 debut long-player Skydancer. They were prolific during those years and toured constantly; when they were home, they issued strings of singles, splits, and EPS including 1995's Of Chaos and Eternal Night. 1999's Projector proved controversial for early fans due to its pronounced use of electronics, but the group shifted back again on 2000's ultra-heavy Haven. By 2002's Damage Done, they had emerged with a mature sound that wed both approaches. 2005's Character proved their commercial breakthrough; it peaked at number three in Sweden and charted across Europe. They doubled down on that approach for 2007's charting Fiction (and spent 22 months on the road), and 2010's We Are the Void. 2013's Construct mixed black metal with melodic death riffs and gothic rock. Following another 18 months of roadwork and a handful of singles, Dark Tranquillity released Atoma in 2016, their first without guitarist Martin Henriksson, who had retired from music. Sweden's record-buying public pushed it to number two on the national charts, and on the album lists of six European countries. Moment was released near the end of 2020 and marked their first outing without founding guitarist Niklas Sundin.Formed under the name Septic Broiler in 1989, Dark Tranquillity honed their chops for a few years and debuted on record in 1993 with the album Skydancer; their lineup consisted of vocalist Anders Friden, guitarists Niklas Sundin and Mikael Stanne, bassist Martin Henriksson, and drummer Anders Jivarp. The band shuffled its membership for the 1995 follow-up EP Of Chaos and Eternal Night; upon Friden's departure, Stanne took over lead vocals and was replaced on guitar by Fredrik Johansson. This lineup remained intact for the full-length The Gallery issued later that year, which helped them build an international fan base. Follow-ups Enter Suicidal Angels (an EP) and the full-length The Mind's I appeared in 1997, marking a tightening of the group's sound into a more compact attack. In 1999, Dark Tranquillity left the Osmose label for a deal with Century Media, consummated by the release of the gothically tinged Projector later that year. Electronics manipulator Martin Brändström subsequently joined the group as an official member, and guitarist Johansson departed the music industry to take a day job; bassist Henriksson took over on guitar, and the bass chair was filled by Michael Niklasson. Haven was released in mid-2000, continuing the less traditional approach of its predecessor. Afterwards, the band would continue moving in a heavier direction with 2002's Damage Done and 2005's Character, which found them getting more atmospheric and aggressive. It also registered with listeners across Europe: It charted in five countries and peaked at number three at home in Sweden. Following 2007's acclaimed, charting Fiction, Dark Tranquillity spent more than a year on the road, headlining the Where Death Is Most Alive tour. Century Media not only issued a split-EP from the tour's participants, they released Manifesto of Dark Tranquillity, a compilation drawn from their catalog starting with Projector. Yesterworlds, a comp of early demos, singles, and unreleased material were also included, along with The Dying Fragments, whose tapes were taken from their earliest rehearsals and live gigs. In 2009, the label also delivered deluxe remastered reissues of Projector, Haven, and Damage Done, and a live DVD from their October tour, appropriately titled Where Death Is Most Alive. In 2010, Dark Tranquillity released We Are the Void while on a U.S. tour headlined by Killswitch Engage. The album peaked inside the Top Ten at home, charted in Europe, and sold respectably in the U.S.; the band undertook their own headline tour of the North American continent accompanied by Threat Signal, Mutiny Within, and the Absence. They took a short break and re-entered the studio in late 2012, emerging in May with Construct, mixed by Jens Bogren. The release proved both controversial and commercially viable due to its meld of back metal tropes, gothic atmospheres, alternate clean vocals, and melodic death metal. It peaked at nine in Sweden, charted across Europe, and even made the Top 200 in the U.S. as Dark Tranquillity toured the world. In March of 2016 founding member and bassist/guitarist Martin Henriksson left the band. He cited losing his passion for playing music. Later that year, the band issued its 11th studio long-player, Atoma, with guitarist Niklas Sundin playing all the guitar parts; the recording also featured new bassist Anders Iwers, who replaced longtime member Daniel Antonsson. Dark Tranquillity embarked on a European tour with main support band Equilibrium and played festival stages across Europe. While they worked the road, Atoma climbed the charts; it peaked at number two in Sweden, charting in nine countries across Europe and even hitting the Japanese album charts. In March 2020, founding guitarist Niklas Sundin departed. Ten days later, the band commenced recording an album and hired guitarists Christopher Amott and Johan Reinholdz, who had toured with the band since 2017. In November, Dark Tranquillity issued Moment. The set was produced by Martin Brändström and mixed and mastered by Bogren.

With Mirror almost breaking the top ten, Norther landed themselves a touring support slot with Dimmu Borgir and Hypocrisy later that year. While the third chapter of Norther, Death Unlimited, wasn't the hit the previous platter was, it led to more shows, and more noteriety. 2005, besides an EP release, found the band working with legendary metal producer Fredrik Nordström (producer of work by other metal legends such as At the Gates and Opeth) on their next opus, the January 2006 release, Till Death Unites Us. Before the release however, Hallio left Norther, and was replaced by Hikki Saari. The album was a huge hit in Finland, hitting number six, and the band spent the better part of the next year and half touring behind it. 2008 marked the band's first release for Century Media, simply titled N. ~ Chris True, Rovi\"\n",

      "\"A punishing progressive thrash metal unit based out Philadelphia, the seeds for Vektor were sewn in Tempe, Arizona in 2002 by frontman/guitarist David DiSanto. Initially operating under the moniker Locrian, the band officially morphed into Vektor in 2004, and quickly became one of the leading lights in the region's fertile metal scene, sharing the stage with notable national acts like Testament, Iced Earth, and Municipal Waste. The band issued their self-released demo, Demolition, in 2006, and began touring both regionally and nationally, eventually inking a deal with Heavy Artillery Records. Their debut album for the label, Black Future, hit the streets in 2009, with their sophomore outing, Outer Isolation, dropping in 2011. The following year saw Vektor move to Earache Records and relocate to Philadelphia. Terminal Redux, their third studio long player and first for outing for Earache, was released in 2016. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi\"\n",

      "\"Finnish melodic swamp metal masters Kalmah took their first stepsback in 1991. Lots of dark water passed in Finnish rivers until the demo eraresulted in a debut album, Swamplord (2000). Ever since, the band hasalways delivered melodic metal in a recognizable Kalmah way:aggressive, melodic, and metallic.After They Will Return (2002) and Swampsong (2003), Kalmah released acertain milestone The Black Waltz (2006). The Black Waltz hit Finnish charts and the message of swampmetal was spread all over the world in an unstoppable way. The Black Waltz was soonfollowed by For the Revolution (2008) and 12 Gauge (2010). Those albums trulysolidified Kalmah's name in the ears of metalheads.Seventh Swamphony (2013) was yet again a landmark time for Kalmah.Inspiration forced the bar higher than before, and with solidarrangements from the band itself as usual, the members dug their faces evendeeper in the turf of Finnish swamps. After Swamphony, the band toured allover the world in the signature Kalmah-way and shoveled on European festival map.After a long wait of five years, the fans were fascinated with Palo, a simply uncompromisingand versatile swamp metal album. At the same time, the band reached an honorable 20 years age.Here we are with a self-titled album five years later, representing theband stronger than ever. Kalmah is proud and thankful to present you with analbum that is swamp metal at its finest; it will signify the end of somethingbut yet unknown.\"\n",

      "'Gothenburg, Sweden-based death metal outfit Dissection were formed in 1989 by singer/guitarist Jon Nödtveidt and bassist Peter Palmdahl; with the addition of drummer Ole Öhman the following spring, the group recorded its first demo, The Grief Prophecy. Following the 1991 Corpsegrinder single \"Into Infinite Obscurity,\" Dissection recorded a second demo named The Somberlain, which resulted in a contract with No Fashion Records and their first album (also titled The Somberlain, but also featuring second guitarist John Zwetsloot) in late 1993. Johan Norman replaced Zwetsloot for the follow-up, 1995\\'s Storm of the Light\\'s Bane, but then, in July of 1997, Nödtveidt and a friend were charged with the brutal murder of an Algerian homosexual. Both were convicted and Nödtveidt received an eight-year sentence, bringing about the end of Dissection. Öhman formed a new group called Reaper, and the release of a rarities collection, The Past is Alive, in 1998 felt like the band\\'s last rites. But the ensuing long silence was eventually broken by 2003\\'s Live Legacy box set, and Nödtveidt\\'s release a year later allowed him to finally revive the Dissection name, starting with the two-song Maha Kali EP (part of which was recorded while he was still in jail). A potential collaboration with former Emperor drummer Bard Faust didn\\'t work out, but by late 2005, Nödtveidt had assembled a new Dissection lineup out of guitarist Set Teitan (see also Aborym), bassist Brice Leclercq (of Nightrage), and drummer Tomas Asklund (ex-Dark Funeral). This foursome recorded Dissection\\'s well-received third studio album, Reinkaos, which was issued in May 2006 by The End Records, and seemed to confirm the band\\'s triumphant rebirth -- later documented on the aptly named Rebirth of Dissection in-concert DVD. However, Dissection\\'s summer tour plans were abruptly cut short, and it was announced that the band would split up following a final string of U.S. dates, which were subsequently canceled due to difficulties obtaining an entry visa because of his criminal record. And then, even while fans were still coming to grips with their disappointment, news began spreading across the Internet that the 31-year-old Nödtveidt had committed suicide with a gunshot to the head, surrounded by candles in his Stockholm, Sweden, apartment, sometime around August 16, 2006. Shortly before the suicide, Nödtveidt is said to have sent farewell letters to his father and several friends and acquaintances -- one of which reportedly read, \"I\\'m going away for a long, long time. I\\'m going to Transylvania.\" ~ Jason Ankeny &amp; Eduardo Rivadavia'\n",

      "'Beyond Creation are a progressive technical death metal quartet from Montreal. What distinguishes them from the mass of bands that labor in the same field is that their music relies heavily on melodic compositions and near-constant rhythmic grooves and easily accessible riffs that seem to be technically impressive by happenstance rather than design, making their sound that much more appealing. Their lyrics and concepts are often rigorously intellectual and deal with topics such as science, spirituality, politics, corruption, government conspiracies, and space aliens.Formed in 2005 by guitarist/lead vocalist Simon Girard and former guitarist Nicolas Domingo Viotto, the pair began writing songs but didn\\'t hire original drummer Guyot Begin-Benoit until 2008. After months of rehearsals and songwriting, Begin-Benoit decided to leave; he was replaced by guitarist/backing vocalist Kevin Chartré. Original bassist Dominic \"Forest\" Lapointe came onboard in 2010. Shortly afterward, Beyond Creation privately issued their first demo, and followed in 2011 with their debut long-player The Aura for PRC Music. In 2012, Philippe Boucher replaced Begin-Benoit in the drum chair. The band subsequently signed to Seasons of Mist in 2013 and the label reissued The Aura, while the band --who had already established a large fan base in Canada -- toured the U.S. and Japan. The new version of the album was greeted with universal acclaim by critics and metal fans alike. Earthborn Evolution followed in 2014, to even greater critical praise and warranted intensive touring over the next several years, taking them on major segues across the Americas and Europe where they headlined their own shows, supported bigger names, and played all the major (and many minor) festival stages. During one of those tours, Lapointe left the band and was replaced by bassist Hugo Doyon-Karout, who stabilized the lineup. Beyond Creation basically lived on the road through 2017, and issued two music videos for \"Coexistence,\" and the track \"Earthborn Evolution\" as stopgaps -- they were writing even during their seemingly endless travels. At the beginning of 2018, they entered the studio and emerged with a third long player. Following the issue of singles and music videos for the tracks \"Theatrical Delirium\" and \"The Inversion,\" Beyond Creation undertook an American tour in support of third long-player Algorythm, released in October. ~ Thom Jurek, Rovi'\n",

By 1992, the band had recorded a couple of demos and opened shows for bands like Sentenced, Amorphis, and Belial. The exposure attracted Finnish label Osmose Productions, who added them to their roster. After rearranging their lineup, replacing Holappa and Halonen with bassist Taneli Jarva and guitarist Jarno Anttila, Impaled Nazarene recorded their debut album Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz, which surprisingly hit number 40 on the Finnish charts. In 1993 they released their second album Ugra-Karma along with an EP entitled Satanic Masowhore. Suomi Finland Perkele, originally titled Hail to Finland, was released in 1994 and was banned by major chainstores due to lyrical content. During a 1995 recording session K. Luttinen quit the band and was replaced by Reima Kellokoski. After a European tour the band returned to the studio to record the album Latex Cult and the EP Motorpenis. At the end of the recordings Jarva left the band and was replaced by Jani Lehtosaari. In 1996 they toured Europe extensively, playing with Dark Tranquillity, Cannibal Corpse, Immolation, Angel Corpse, Gehennah, and Vader. Hare Krishnas slapped a lawsuit on the band and Osmose in 1997, claiming the cover art for Ugra-Karma was offensive. Osmose settled the case and re-released the album with a different cover. Their sixth release, Rapture, hit the stores in 1998 which they followed with extensive touring through Europe, the U.S., and Mexico. They went back to the studio in 1999 to record a split 7\" with Driller Killer and the album Nihil, that features yet another lineup change with Alexi \"Wild Child\" Laiho replacing Mika Pääkkö on guitar.

Emerging in the mid-\\'90s as a straightforward death metal unit, the band was founded by guitarist Arkadius Antonik and drummer Stefan Möller; the group\\'s moniker is derived from the former\\'s forename in reverse. Originally operating under the name Gloryfication, they settled on Suidakra after adding keyboardist Daniela Voigt, guitarist Marcel Schoenen, and bassist Christoph Zacharowski to the roster. The newly minted quintet issued their debut album, Lupine Essence, independently in 1997. The record caught the ear of German label Last Episode, which signed the group the following year and released their sophomore effort, Auld Lang Syne. Bass player Zacharowski left the fold shortly after the album\\'s release, making way for Nils Bross, who made his studio debut on 1999\\'s Lays Afar -- both that LP and 2000\\'s The Arcanum saw the band adopt a more aggressive, Gothenburg-style death metal. A flurry of lineup and stylistic changes followed in the latter album\\'s wake, as did a move to Sony imprint Century Media, which released Emprise to Avalon in 2002 and Signs for the Fallen in 2003. Creative differences with Century Media led the group to sign with Armageddon Music for album number seven, 2005\\'s Command to Charge. With sole original member Arkadius Antonik now overseeing a rotating crew of players, the group looked to the war between the Picts and the Roman Empire for 2006\\'s ambitious Caledonia, which hewed toward more traditional folk melodies with Highland bagpipes prominently featured. Taking its name from the Gaelic word for \"bravery,\" 2008\\'s Crógacht continued the group\\'s transformation from death metal savages to Celtic-themed power metallers, going so far as to add a 16-member choir to the mix. In 2011, the band inked a deal with AFM Records and issued their tenth full-length outing, Book of Dowth. A heavy bout of touring found the group making stops in India and the United States preceding the arrival of 2013\\'s Eternal Defiance. 2016\\'s powerful Realms of Odoric and 2018\\'s ambient folk tome Cimbric Yarns eschewed history for fantasy, looking to the fantastical worlds of Belgian artist and frequent visual collaborator Kris Verwimp for inspiration.

Awaking the Centuries followed in 2000, and in 2004, Haggard -- led by songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist Asis Nasseri -- released the Galileo Galilei-inspired work Eppur Si Muove. Since their introduction, Haggard have also released a couple of videos, 1998's In a Pale Moon's Shadow and 2001's Awaking the Gods: Live in Mexico, as well as a live CD of the latter.

They will release their new album \"Anima\" on the 4th of September 2020. Rarely there is a better soundtrack at hand for the approaching autumn than this album, lingering amid heavy, dark and slow waters.The upcoming album presents the darkest and the most melancholic Noumena so far. Band\\'s unique style to weave wistful melodies is present once again. The songs offer glimpses of Finnish folk music and old schlager fortified with merciless and heavy base. The distinctive feature of \"Anima\" is melancholy and serenity.Markus Hirvonen, who joined the band in 2018, strengthens Noumena\\'s musical expression with his guitar playing, singing and composition skills. Besides guitarist Ville Lamminaho, the main songwriter, every member in Noumena has contributed to music or lyrics on the album.Thematically the album approaches death and loss from various viewpoints. Anima is a manifestation of spirit, soul and vitality, which takes a form of a soul bird in Finnish folklore. It is an ethereal spirit animal, who brings soul in birth and takes it away in death. As \"Saatto\" song puts it: eventually everyone joins the symphony of souls and leaves only echoes in this world. The upcoming album trusts in Finnish lyrics like its predecessor.'\n",

      "\"King of Asgard is a 21st century Swedish metal band formed by ex-Mithotyn members Karl Beckmann (guitar/vocals) and Karsten Larsson (drums). Their ever-evolving sound oscillates between harsh and evocative Nordic blackness and captivating, epic folk melodies, forcefully expressed through melodic death, black and Viking metal. Their lyrical topics and visuals often relate to legends in their homeland's sagas and Norse myths, with a penchant for nearly epic-length storytelling. Their debut long-player, 2010's Fi'mbulvintr, was celebrated for its athletic musicianship, physicality, and intricate folk-metal tendencies amid shifting tempos and harsh black metal vocals. 2012's To North showcased even heavier Viking metal with more riffing and less variation in tempo. 2014's Karg was marked by midtempo and slow songs with pronounced grooves and complex arrangements. After Larsson's departure in 2015, the band signed to Trollmusic. They issued the six-track EP :taudr: in 2017, and followed it with the darker, edgier, harsher, full-length Svartrviðr in 2021. King of Asgard grew out of founders and former Mithotyn members Karl Beckmann's (guitar/vocals) and Karsten Larsson's (drums) obsession with discovering a true hybrid of Viking metal's more punishing death metal approach and the moodier, darker, folk-inflected harshness of black metal.

Over the past four albums, the Francesco Paoli-led trio have planned every step, discussed every note, and ensured every salutation to Paganini, Bach, and Mozart was met with an equally brutal death metal equivalent. On Veleno, which is Italian for ‘venom,\\' they needed a change of approach (and pace). To achieve this, Fleshgod Apocalypse distanced themselves from distractions and frustrations of day-to-day life, unboxed the songwriting process, and let the inspiration flow freely. With the best possible production job and real orchestral ensembles—a full string quartet, a classical percussionist, and a baroque choir were part of the process—and guest musicians , Veleno is Fleshgod Apocalypse\\'s masterwork. After recording, they took the effort over to Grammy-nominated Jacob Hansen at Hansen Studios in Denmark for mixing and mastering. On Veleno, they\\'ve matured, blended more efficiently their musical vision, and walked away with 11 songs that sound like a new band with an unsatiable prey drive.Frontman, multi-instrumentalist and mastermind Francesco says: \"What you\\'ll hear is the harvest of three years of sweat, revolutions, intense emotions and extreme challenges.

      "'Regarded as pioneers of the folk-metal movement, Finntroll emerged in the late 1990s with a sound that combined the extreme elements of death metal with traditional Finnish folk melodies. In the 2000s and beyond, the band found international success with albums like Ur Jordens Djup (2007), Blodsvept (2013), and Vredesvävd (2020), which saw them move deeper into the realm of ancient music, incorporating joik (a shamanistic chant that is believed to be one of the oldest-known musical forms in Northern Europe) into their death metal maelstrom. Founded in Helsinki, Finntroll\\'s distinct sound was born one drunken night in 1997 when founding members Teemu \"Somnium\" Raimoranta (ex-Thy Serpent and Impaled Nazarene) and Jan \"Katla\" Jämsen decided to add the de-tuned guitars and brutal vocals of black metal to regional folk melodies played in the humppa style (a form of polka) on the keyboard. The duo recruited guitarist Samuli \"Skrymer\" Ponsimaa, drummer Samu \"Beast Dominator\" Ruotsalainen, keyboardist Henri \"Trollhorn\" Sorvali, and bassist Sami \"Tundra\" Uusitalo and recorded the demo Rivfader the following year. Its lineup intact, Finntroll released a debut album, 1999\\'s Midnattens Widunder, on Spikefarm Records. For their follow-up, Jaktens Tid, the band moved deeper into the realm of Finnish folk music. Entering the Finnish charts at number 20, Jaktens Tid was a surprise success in 2001, resulting in Century Media picking up the album for international distribution. In 2003, during the recording of the acoustic EP Visor Om Slutet, guitarist Teemu Raimoranta was killed after falling from a bridge in Hakaniemi, and vocalist Jämsen, suffering from a viral-based tumor in his vocal cords, was forced to take a leave of absence from the group that he and Raimoranta had co-founded. Heartbroken but undeterred, Finntroll brought in vocalist Tapio Wilska (Sethian, Lyijykomppania) to complete the project, which was released in 2003. Guitarist Mikael Karlbom joined the group in 2004 and made his studio debut on the Trollhammaren EP. Two years later, Jämsen was let go and replaced by Mathias \"Vreth\" Lillmåns, who made his recorded debut on 2007\\'s epic Ur Jordens Djup -- Jämsen retained a presence in the band as the primary lyricist. The album saw Finntroll taking a heavier, more black metal-forward approach to their craft, a style that was carried over to 2010\\'s acclaimed Nifelvind. Blodsvept, the group\\'s sixth full-length effort, arrived in 2013 and would be the last outing for longtime drummer Samu Ruotsalainen, who left the fold amicably the following year. The band later recruited Heikki \"Mörkö\" Saari (Norther), who sat behind the kit for 2020\\'s blackened folk-metal opus Vredesvävd. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "'Arguably the most influential and successful European thrash metal band despite some competition from outfits such as Sodom, Destruction, and Tankard, Germany\\'s Kreator are by far the most enduring. Like many of their European speed metal brethren, Kreator fused the big four\\'s -- Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer -- thrash innovations with Venom\\'s proto-black metal imagery, sparked it with Motörhead\\'s terminal velocity, and capped it off with the nihilistic outlook typical of heavy metal since the seminal days of Black Sabbath. Kreator\\'s career also mirrored speed metal\\'s rising and waning fortunes: moving from strength to strength throughout the \\'80s and culminating in two now-classic albums, 1989\\'s Extreme Aggression and the following year\\'s Coma of Souls. As the new decade gave birth to grunge, Kreator felt it necessary to evolve, spending most of the rest of the decade taking their collective foot off the gas and exploring various combinations of industrial, goth rock, and alternative sounds resulting on 1999\\'s post-metal Endorama. Its reception was their greatest in nearly a decade and kicked off a creative rebirth at the dawn of the new century, evidenced by 2001\\'s universally lauded comeback, Violent Revolution, from which they never turned back. In the 21st century, Kreator are certified worldwide superstars who tour as widely and frequently as bands half their age, delivering standard-bearing recordings such as 2012\\'s Phantom Antichrist, 2017\\'s Gods of Violence, and 2022\\'s Hate Über Alles. Originally named Tyrant and then Tormentor, Kreator were founded in 1982 by vocalist/guitarist Mille Petrozza, bassist Rob Fioretti, and drummer Jürgen Reil (aka Ventor) in the industrial capital of Essen, Germany. They were still known as Tormentor when their first two demo tapes, one fittingly named Blitzkrieg (1983), and the other End of the World (1984), fell into the hands of thousands of heavy metal fans engaging in the era\\'s bustling underground tape-trading network. Positive word of mouth soon attracted the attention of Germany\\'s own metal start-up, Noise Records, which signed the newly re-christened Kreator to a deal and immediately put them to work on their first album. Recorded in just ten days at Berlin\\'s Musiclab Studios, 1985\\'s Endless Pain was a savage debut, but its crude thrashing quickly had the underground metal world abuzz with excitement. A second guitar player, Wulf, was hired for touring purposes, and with Kreator\\'s reputation preceding them, lucky fans within the band\\'s modest touring radius were soon clamoring for tickets.No sooner had they come off the road than Kreator were heading right back to Musiclab Studios, this time with producer Harris Johns (Helloween, Voivod) to record their second album, Pleasure to Kill. Unleashed in 1986 and still considered the band\\'s first \"classic\" album, Pleasure to Kill raised the bar with more diversity of tempos and greater attention to technical execution while losing nothing in terms of ferocity or speed. The band closed out the year with the Flag of Hate EP (named after a re-recorded version of their earliest hit), and there seemed to be little doubt that Kreator, along with fellow Germans Helloween and Switzerland\\'s Celtic Frost (with whom they toured the U.K. a year later), were fast becoming Europe\\'s top extreme metal contenders. Recorded at Hanover\\'s Horus Studios with English producer Roy Rowland, 1987\\'s Terrible Certainty did nothing to dent this perception, since, for once, Petrozza and company actually had a little time to work out the songs beforehand. The ensuing tour further established their reputation as dedicated road warriors and saw Kreator beefed up to a quartet once again with the addition of guitarist Jörge Trebziatowski. Profits from these concerts would help finance yet another EP (product being something Noise never stopped asking for) titled Out of the Dark, Into the Light, released in August 1988.By this time, all signs suggested that Kreator were on the verge of a major breakthrough, and when Noise struck a deal with giant Epic Records for large-scale distribution in America, Petrozza knew this was his chance of taking his band global. Mustering all of his creative juices and honing his songwriting, he led Kreator into Los Angeles\\' Music Grinder Studios and brought in well-regarded producer Randy Burns (Megadeth, Nuclear Assault, etc.) to guide them to another thrash metal landmark with 1989\\'s Extreme Aggression. With videos made for the ubiquitous title track and the venomous \"Betrayer\" getting plenty of exposure on MTV\\'s Headbangers Ball, Extreme Aggression quickly became their biggest seller yet, and the subsequent North American swing with Suicidal Tendencies introduced the band to many new friends. The tour also marked the debut of former Sodom guitarist Frank \"Blackfire\" Gosdzik, whose nightly lead guitar duels with Petrozza are still the stuff of fond memories for Kreator fans. Seeking to capitalize on the group\\'s momentum, Noise rushed them back into the studio to whip up their next effort, Coma of Souls, released in October 1990. Unfortunately, the hastily conceived LP clearly suffered from the less than favorable circumstances in which it was created, seeming too much like a retread of earlier material and bogged down by filler. It should also be noted that, by the end of the \\'80s, thrash and speed metal had largely run their course and mutated into death metal, leaving genre standard-bearers like Kreator, Anthrax, and even Metallica with a difficult choice: evolve or perish.Released in 1992, the appropriately named Renewal seemed to answer that question by going straight to the source for help. Kreator sought out renowned producer Tom Morris (Sepultura, Morbid Angel, etc.) at his Morrissound Studios in Tampa to help them delve deeper into the death metal template. (One thing that needed no updating was Petrozza\\'s hissing, scratchy voice, which of course, pre-dated, and no doubt influenced, death metal\\'s Cookie Monster vocal style.) Proving just how wary (perhaps too wary) the studio was of current trends, Renewal also came slathered in industrial-metal techniques -- something that did not go over well with Kreator and was later blamed for the album\\'s disappointing showing. The excruciatingly taxing tour commitments that followed took the band as far as South America, but understandably left them physically and creatively exhausted, prompting Petrozza to announce a protracted break to recover. Incredibly, Kreator\\'s silence was only broken three years later with the release of 1995\\'s somewhat back to basics Cause for Conflict -- their first effort for new label GUN Records. Hardly a successful comeback, the album found Kreator confused and uninspired -- hopelessly out of touch with the day\\'s reigning extreme metal trends, and surely traumatized by the recent departure of both Fioretti and Ventor (they were replaced by bassist Christian Giesler and former Whiplash drummer Joe Cangelosi). Adding insult to injury, Noise Records chose exactly this difficult moment to release the Scenarios of Violence set -- a collection of live recordings and remixed old hits that seemed to declare Kreator\\'s future prospects null and void.Looking to remedy the band\\'s tenuous situation, Petrozza called upon former Coroner guitar wizard Tommy Vetterli to help him guide Kreator into realms unknown, getting even further away from their roots on their next two albums, the highly experimental Outcast (1997) and Endorama (1999). Both of these veered into ever-slower pacing, added gothic and ambient elements, incorporated samples and loops, and even found Petrozza trying a few different singing styles on for size. But even though they met with certain critical acclaim and signaled Ventor\\'s welcome return to Kreator\\'s ranks, neither of these albums managed to reignite the band\\'s career. Yet again, timely retrospective releases like 1999\\'s Voices of Transgression (shedding light on the band\\'s hit-and-miss second decade) and 2000\\'s Past Life Trauma (a near-flawless wrap-up of their first decade) provided some consolation for disgruntled old fans who had long abandoned Kreator\\'s floundering ship, but, unexpectedly, they also cleared the way for a rebirth of sorts.This renaissance began to take shape following Vetterli\\'s departure and the signing of a new record deal with Germany\\'s SPV label. Simply put, Petrozza recommitted himself to thrash, and, after hiring Finnish-born second guitarist Sami Yli-Sirnio, proceeded to write Kreator\\'s strongest album in years, with 2001\\'s positively stunning Violent Revolution. In keeping with Kreator tradition, the consequent world tour became their most comprehensive and extensive to date. Thanks to Violent Revolution\\'s great success, it served to reintroduce and reestablish Kreator as one of the world\\'s premiere speed metal acts -- a feat that was commemorated with the group\\'s first live album -- a lavish set appositely named (with some grammatical license) Live Kreation/Revisioned Glory -- a couple of years later. The band returned in 2005 with the similarly themed Enemy of God, followed by At the Pulse of Kapitulation: Live in East Berlin, 1990 in 2008 and the reliably thrash-heavy Hordes of Chaos in 2009.In 2010 the band signed to leading German metal stable Nuclear Blast before embarking on a 25th anniversary tour of North America, which was followed in short order by the European Thrashfest tour with contemporaries such as Death Angel and Exodus. Their first album for their new label was 2012\\'s Phantom Antichrist, which saw them in fine form and was hailed as one of their best in years; it was also a major commercial success in Germany, rising to number five on the album charts, the group\\'s strongest showing to date in their homeland. The road-hungry band promoted the album with yet another tour, culminating in an explosive, sold-out show in their hometown of Oberhausen in front of a packed audience of die-hard fans, which was recorded and filmed for the 2013 live album Dying Alive. Like Phantom Antichrist, Dying Alive proved there was still a ready audience for Kreator, with the album hitting number nine on the German charts. Despite this it would be a long five years before fans were treated to new material. It was finally announced in 2016 that their 14th studio album, Gods of Violence, would be released in 2017, marking the end of the longest recording gap in the band\\'s history. A similar gap occurred in the run-up to their acclaimed 15th studio album, 2022\\'s Hate Über Alles, which charted in over a dozen countries and was their first with bassist Frédéric LeClercq (DragonForce). The following year saw Kreator team up with stage mates Lamb of God on the single \"State of Unrest\" ahead of the European tour of the same name. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

After several independent demos and seven years together, Omnium Gatherum signed with Rage of Achilles and released their 2003 full-length debut, Spirits and August Light. Along with keyboardist Mikko Pennanen the membership on their first album included Vanhala, Filppu, Harri and Jarmo Pikka, and Markkanen, all of whom except Pennanen appeared on their 2004 follow-up, Years in Waste, which appeared via the Nuclear Blast label. This release marked a noticeable shift toward a more technical, progressive approach as well as Filppu\\'s last appearance on vocals. By 2007, the band had again swapped labels, this time to Candlelight Records, and introduced vocalist Jukka Pelkonen and keyboardist Aapo Koivisto, both of whom would go on to become core members with their own distinctive sound. Their first release with this new lineup, Stuck Here on Snake\\'s Way, made a solid showing on the Finnish albums chart and was followed in 2008 by the more innovative effort The Redshift, which marked their first time working with Swedish metal titan Dan Swanö, and placed even higher on the national chart at number 24. Between those two releases, bassist Markkanen was replaced by Eerik Purdon, who himself was succeeded in 2009 by Toni \"Tsygä\" Mäki. Another major lineup shift occurred with the departure of longtime guitarist Harri Pikka, leaving Omnium Gatherum a five-piece on their epic 2011 Lifeforce Records debut New World Shadows.New World Shadows proved to be a both a commercial breakthrough, topping the Finnish album chart, and it was touted by critics as one of Finland\\'s finest representations of melodic death metal. Following its release, the group promoted touring guitarist Joonas \"Jope\" Koto into proper band membership. With their recently boosted profile, Omnium Gatherum spent a significant amount of time on their follow-up, working with producers Teemu Aalto and Sami Koivisto and enlisting Swanö to mix 2013\\'s Beyond. One of their more melodic releases, it continued in the tradition of both The Redshift and New World Shadows. With Swanö back in the producer role and incoming drummer Tuomo Latvala taking over Jarmo Pikka\\'s seat, the band issued the more wide-ranging Grey Heavens in 2016, making their debut for the Century Media label. This same lineup returned two years later to release their eighth album, The Burning Cold. 2020 saw the release of the Nuclear Blast Recordings, which compiled the band\\'s first two albums (Spirits and August Light and Years in Waste) and the 2002 EP Steal the Light. ~ Timothy Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "\"“It doesn't get more blasphemous than this.”That's Behemoth mastermind Nergal talking about the title of the band's 11th and latest album, I Loved You At Your Darkest. While it certainly seems an unlikely title for a black metal band—especially one that called their last album The Satanist—its origin might surprise you even more than the words themselves. “It's a verse from the Bible,” Nergal reveals. “It's actually a quote from Jesus Christ himself. For Behemoth to use it as the basis of our record, it's sacrilege to the extreme.”Nergal and his bandmates—Orion (bass) and Inferno (drums)—have channeled that passion into I Loved You At Your Darkest. A crushing salvo of black metal majesty replete with hellish riffs, thundering drum cannonades and soaring liturgical choirs reminiscent of classic horror cinema, the album is also bejeweled with nimble-fingered rock guitar solos on songs like “God=Dog,” “Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica” and “Sabbath Mater.”&lt;br&gt;\"\n",

      "'Born in Oslo, Norway under the supervision of guitarist/singer Thomas \"Grusom\" Rune and fellow ax-man Jardar, the two wanted to create a project that was filled with the bleak lyrical content of modern day black metal and an influence of early death metal. The results were Old Man\\'s Child, who made their debut in late 1993. After eventually inking a deal with the Norway based Hot Records in 1994, their first full-length Born of the Flickering came about later on that year. After a bit of a change in their rhythm section, the re-release of their first demo In The Shades of Life came out in 1996 on a Mini-CD format, digital re-mix and a different packaging was also included. Century Media Records soon took notice and re-issued their first album Born of The Flickering to an American audience. With their next full-length The Pagan Prosperity and a European tour with Rotting Christ and Sacramentum, Old Man\\'s Child\\'s line up was fully in place with drummer Sarke and bassist Blodstrup -both formerly of Tulus. Rune changed his stage name to Galder as well, using the moniker from that point forward. As the wave of black metal continued to flurish in their Scandinavian home territory, Old Man\\'s Child marched along with their third full-length, 1998\\'s Ill-Natured Spiritual Invasion, which was almost entirely performed by Galder. Revelation 666: Curse of Damnation followed two years later, preceding Galder\\'s announcement that he would be joining Dimmu Borgir as a guitarist. Refusing to let Old Man\\'s Child dissolve, he decided to put the project on hold and write and tour with his new bandmates. At the end of 2002, the band came back together with Galder, Jardar and Dimmu Borgir drummer Nicholas Barker to work on a new record. The result, In Defiance of Existence, was released that following January. ~ Mike DaRonco, Rovi'\n",

      "'Described as \"the world\\'s greatest cultural force,\" the virtual death metal band Dethklok star in the Adult Swim television show Metalocalypse. The Mordland-based quintet consists of vocalist Nathan Explosion, who uses a death metal growl even when he\\'s not singing; lead guitarist Skwisgar Skwigelf, the fastest string slinger alive; rhythm guitarist Toki Wartooth, the second-fastest guitar player alive; bassist and Civil War memorabilia collector William Murderface, and Pickles the Drummer. Born and raised in Florida, Explosion didn\\'t speak until the age of five and was a poor student, only showing skill in football and frog dissection, but these early experiences made him an expert on all things brutal and metal. Murderface had an even more harrowing childhood: his father killed his mother, and then himself, with a chain saw when Murderface was still a baby, leaving the toddler to be raised by his grandparents, Thunderbolt and Stella. Murderface began playing music seriously at a fairly young age, earning his high school diploma by playing bass after threatening to cut out his principal\\'s eyes. Along with his Dethklok duties, Murderface also helms the side project Planet Piss. Skwigelf\\'s mother, Serveta, was Miss Sweden of 1956, and her promiscuous and neglectful ways left young Skwisgar plenty of time for guitar practice (though, due to music dyslexia, he can\\'t read a note of music). Before joining Dethklok, Skwigelf played in many Swedish bands, including Agnostic Priest, Sausage Assassin, and Financially Raped. His hands have been insured for ten billion dollars, and he has a vast collection of unique guitars, including the sword-shaped Gibson Excaliburtar, a Swiss Army-tar, and one allegedly made out of the True Cross. Pickles also had an established career in music prior to Dethklok. The Tomahawk, Wisconsin, native found fame with the L.A. hair metal act Snakes \\'n\\' Barrels during the style\\'s peak years. Wartooth is Dethklok\\'s youngest member; born to Anja and the Reverend Aslaug Wartooth, he grew up in an abandoned village outside of Lilliehammer, Norway. Like the rest of the band, Wartooth has extensive endorsement deals, including one with Willard Wonky Hard Candy Company. Deals such as Explosion Sauce, a mustardy North Carolina-style barbecue sauce hawked by Nathan Explosion, and \"Pickles\\' Nickels\" -- an endorsement deal the drummer has with the United States Treasury -- help make Dethklok the 12th largest economy in the world, surpassing Belgium. This financial security came in handy during the difficult process of recording The Dethalbum. Aside from the fact that a tribunal of global and corporate authority figures noticed a disturbing resemblance between the band and Sumerian artifacts with glyphs prophesying the apocalypse, the band scrapped early sessions due to Explosion\\'s perfectionist tendencies. Instead, Dethklok recorded in a Russian nuclear submarine in the Mariana Trench with expert producer Dick \"Magic Ears\" Knubbler. Other setbacks, such as summoning a lake troll on a goodwill trip to Finland, a stint in band therapy with therapist Dr. John Twinkletits, shooting the film Blood Ocean, Pickles\\' reunion tour with Snakes \\'n\\' Barrels, and a depression that the band overcame with the help of blues legend Mashed Potato Johnson, delayed the album, leaving fans suicidal with anticipation. With the help of Metalocalypse creator Brendon Small and Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan, the sessions were finished, and The Dethalbum was finally released in fall 2007 on the Williams Street label. Dethalbum II arrived in 2009, and was followed by Dethalbum III in 2012. An intense year followed for the heavy metal masters as increasing tensions and rising violence led to the band deciding to break up. After the kidnapping of Toki Wartooth, the legendary band decided to continue working together, taking a step toward fulfilling their destiny as agents of prophecy with their 2013 album, The Doomstar Requiem: A Klok Opera. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi'\n",

Released in 2008 under the evocative title of Mind Control, the album featured three re-recorded tracks among nine brand new tunes, but all of them sounded as oppressively brutal as ever. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

      "\"Canadian deathcore pioneers DESPISED ICON are back to reveal their 6th full length album: »Purgatory.« Not a theological band by any means, »Purgatory« is meant to represent the mortal experience of being trapped in a suffering state and left to brood; stuck in notions of great loss and permanent scars that will ultimately define you. It is from these incidents that humans grow. “It's about taking the right, and necessary steps to better yourself and fix the things that are going wrong,” explains vocalist Alex Erian. “Transitioning from a state of constant negativity into something more constructive or healthy. It's not about achieving perfection, but finding a middle ground between those good and bad impulses.” Not only do the themes of »Purgatory« reflect the personal and internal struggles of the band, but the struggles of modern day society as a whole, and the current lack of compassion amongst mankind. “Even if the odds seem against us now more than ever, I'm still on the side of hope,” Erian reflects.Perhaps their most dynamic venture to date, DESPISED ICON have a fresh and energy filled arrangement just waiting to see the light of day in the form of »Purgatory.« For many years, they have laid the foundation of deathcore and spearheaded different sounds and movements within the genre. Their latest offering will not leave those so impressed by their recent return in any way disappointed.\"\n",

      "\"Inspired by the ultra-brutal and hyper-complex death metal aesthetic pioneered by Canadian clinicians such as Cryptopsy and Neuraxis, technical death metal band Beneath the Massacre emerged in 2005 with the punishing Evidence of Inequity EP. Since their debut, the band has issued a string of innovative deathcore efforts including Dystopia (2008) and Fearmonger (2020). Hailing from Montreal, the band was formed in 2004 by vocalist Elliot Desgagnés, guitarists Christopher Bradley and Jonathan Dubeau, bassist Dennis Bradley, drummer Justin Rousselle, and, for a brief spell, keyboard player Christian Pépin. Beneath the Massacre followed their debut 2005 EP Evidence of Inequity, with two highly regarded full-lengths released through Prosthetic Records: 2007's Mechanics of Dysfunction, and 2008's Dystopia. Both albums were cut by the pared-down lineup of Desgagnés, the Bradley siblings, and Rousselle; they later embarked on their first headline tour of the U.S. in 2008, supported by Arsis and Ion Dissonance, before joining the Summer Slaughter trek, also featuring Necrophagist, Cephalic Carnage, and Cattle Decapitation, among others. The EP Marée Noire arrived two years later, followed by the band's third full-length effort, Incongruous, in 2012. After supporting the LP as part of the Bonecrusher Fest alongside contemporaries Carnifex, Molotov Solution, Within the Ruins, and Betraying the Martyrs, Beneath the Massacre began to temper their tour schedule and remained relatively silent until 2019. That year saw the group announce the impending arrival of their long-awaited fourth studio long-player, as well as a return to the stage. The resulting Fearmonger, their first outing for Century Media, arrived in early 2020. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Six Feet Under is an American death metal band based in Tampa, Florida. Their sonic trademark offers filthy, plodding, straight-ahead grooves and crunchy blastbeats along with controversial lyrics from founder and vocalist Chris Barnes; the latter continually revolve around themes of graphic violence, gore, and death, exemplified to an extreme degree on 1999\\'s Maximum Violence. The band\\'s straightforward performance approach relies more on physical force than speed and endeared them to live audiences across the globe. Since 2000, Six Feet Under have appended their original releases with a cyclical, numbered series of covers albums entitled Graveyard Classics wherein the band applies their \"death \\'n\\' roll\" approach to hard rock, punk, and metal standards. 2003\\'s Bringer of Blood found Barnes grafting his now-signature, high-pitched \"pig squeal\" onto his guttural vocals, adding an instantly recognizable textural dynamic to his delivery. 2008\\'s Death Rituals won listener acclaim as well as respect from critics for its integration of thrash riffs and blastbeat drums over 13 brutal songs. 2012\\'s Undead combined that sound with a dynamic, almost industrial brand of death metal. 2016\\'s Graveyard Classics IV: The Number of the Priest offered only the songs of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. For 2017\\'s Torment, the band showcased an even more groove-oriented approach in their writing and recording processes, winning near-ecstatic reviews from fans.Six Feet Under was founded in 1993. It was originally intended as a side project for Cannibal Corpse vocalist Chris Barnes and former Obituary guitarist Allen West and became a primary outlet after Barnes and Cannibal Corpse parted company while recording the latter\\'s Vile. The first version of Six Feet Under also included ex-Death bassist Terry Butler and drummer Greg Gall. The quartet signed to Metal Blade and issued the Brian Slagel-produced Haunted in 1995 to positive reviews. After Barnes left Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under hit the road and issued the Alive and Dead EP in 1996 as a stopgap until they assembled to cut and release Warpath the following year. West left the band in the aftermath and was replaced by guitarist Steve Swanson. Third album Maximum Violence appeared in 1999 and was critically debased in the mainstream rock press for the brutality and misanthropy in Barnes\\' lyrics. That said, it put them on the map globally with metal fans. The first volume in the Graveyard Classics series followed a year later. It included death metal versions of songs by Black Sabbath, Dead Kennedys, Deep Purple, Venom, AC/DC, the Monkees, Jimi Hendrix, and more. It was one of the year\\'s most talked-about metal releases. 2001\\'s True Carnage featured guest vocals from Ice-T and Karyn Crisis; it proved the band\\'s most popular release to that date and peaked inside the Top 20 on the Heatseekers chart, landing them prime international touring slots. The live Double Dead arrived in 2002 and was accompanied by a separate concert video. The arrival of 2003\\'s Barnes-produced, Slagel-mixed Bringer of Blood offered a significant change in the band\\'s sound due to Barnes grafting a high-pitched \"pig squeal\" onto his dirty, growling vocals. A disorienting texture, this double-tracked trait became a hallmark of the band\\'s approach on subsequent studio outings.Graveyard Classics, Vol. 2 appeared in 2004. On it, Six Feet Under re-interpreted AC/DC\\'s classic Back in Black album in its entirety. For the 2005 studio outing 13, Barnes added yet another textural element to his vocalizing: He began barking his words, adding a percussive character to the band\\'s already drum-heavy sound. It registered with fans and added to the band\\'s live reputation. After a decade together, the band had become a headliner attraction internationally. They celebrated their anniversary with the five-disc box set Decade in the Grave that compiled well-known studio recordings, rarities, and live material. Its final disc was a concert DVD. Six Feet Under toured the globe to support both releases.The band went back to basics on 2007\\'s Commandment, relying on their seemingly perfected balance of hard grooves and retro death metal. After a short U.S. tour, they re-entered the studio late in the year. They emerged with Death Rituals in 2008 followed by nearly two years of national and international touring. After a short break, SFU re-entered the studio and, according to all accounts, had a ball recording Graveyard Classics, Vol. 3. Issued in 2010, it offered radical interpretations of tunes by Mercyful Fate, Metallica, Van Halen, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, the Ramones, and Slayer, among others.Other membership shakeups began in 2011-2012: bassist Butler left to join Obituary; he was replaced on tour by Matt DeVries for a year. Gall left to pursue a new project called Exitsect. Barnes recruited drummer Kevin Talley and added guitarist/bassist Rob Arnold. This quartet lineup released the well-received Undead in 2012. Its follow-up, 2013\\'s Unborn, featured a quintet with bassist Jeff Hughell and guitarist Ola Englund (the Haunted) who replaced Arnold. It also featured guest guitar spots from Whitechapel\\'s Ben Savage and Torture Killer\\'s Jari Laine.After exhausting tours of Europe and the U.S., wholesale lineup changes occurred inside Six Feet Under. By the time 2015\\'s Crypt of the Devil appeared, the band was in a state of flux. The lineup included collaborations between Barnes and Cannabis Corpse bassist/guitarist/vocalist Phil \"Landphil\" Hall, studio drummer Josh \"Hallhammer\" Hall, and guest guitar spots from Rebecca Scammon, Brandon Ellis, and Ray Suhy -- the latter would join the band the following year. Graveyard Classics, Vol. 4: Number of the Priest followed in 2016 and took as its mantle the catalogs of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. Given Barnes\\' limited vocal range, SFU downtuned each selection with sometimes controversial results. After a U.S, festival tour, SFU issued its 12th studio long-player, Torment, in 2017. The set was recorded by the trio of Barnes, guitarist/bassist Hughell, and touring drummer Marco Pitruzzella, who joined the band officially just in time for the release and world tour in support. Barnes re-established ties with ex-Cannibal Corpse guitarist and songwriter Jack Owen, and he joined the band. Now a quintet, the lineup entered the studio with producer and mixing engineer Chris Carroll. They emerged with the full-length Nightmares of the Decomposed in October of 2020. ~ Thom Jurek, Rovi'\n",

Ion Dissonance were formed in Montreal, Quebec in mid-2002 by guitarists Sebastien Chaput and Antoine Lussier and drummer J.F. Richard, metal fans interested in taking the music to new sonic extremes. Teaming with vocalist Gabriel McCaughry and bassist Sebastien Painchaud, Ion Dissonance recorded their first demo in the fall of 2002, and it was released to fans under the title .357 by the end of the year. The demo EP earned the band positive press attention and Ion Dissonance began sharing stages with the likes of the Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die and the Black Dahlia Murder. In the spring of 2003, Ion Dissonance began work on their first full-length album, but not before bassist Painchaud left the group, to be replaced by Miguel Valade. Pennsylvania-based metal label Willowtip Records released Ion Dissonance's debut album, Breathing Is Irrelevant, in the fall of 2003, with an American tour following early in 2004.

That same month, vocalist McCaughry announced he was leaving Ion Dissonance due to creative differences, and in the fall, the band disclosed that Kevin McCaughey, formerly of the group Shaolin, had signed on as their new singer, in time to begin recording on the group's next album, Minus the Herd, which was released by Abacus in June 2007. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi\"\n",

Led by vocalist and sole constant member James \"Human Furnace\" Bulloch, the band\\'s earlier works embraced the pit-inducing fury of classic hardcore. Later efforts like 2005\\'s Justice Replaced by Revenge, 2014\\'s Hammer of the Witch, and 2023\\'s Seeing Through Fire saw the group lean hard into their thrash tendencies while retaining an immovable foundation of brutalist hardcore. Formed in 1989, Ringworm joined contemporaries like Integrity in a brutal musical community that blended purist hardcore with heavy metal influences and punishing live shows. They played constantly for four years all over Ohio and West Virginia, securing a rabid fan base who embraced their 1991 self-titled demo and bolstered their renown among the thrash underground in the continental U.S. Their debut full-length Promise appeared in 1993 on Incision, and garnered enough interest to tour the U.S., following the release with several singles that cemented their reputation for sonic malevolence. After the inevitable round of lineup changes throughout the decade, the band went on hiatus, re-emerging in 2001 with Birth Is Pain on Victory, where they remained through 2005\\'s unrelenting Justice Replaced by Revenge. Touring between albums became even more difficult as vocalist Human Furnace started a chain of tattoo shops called 252 Tattoo, while guitarist Frank Novinec joined Terror, precipitating another break.

While it may come as a surprise to some fans, the themes of Necromanteum are a little less personal compared to previous releases. Vocalist and founder Scott Ian Lewis explains: “We wanted to delve into more supernatural and ethereal subjects like astral projection, the duality of man, and the crossroads of intellectualism and the supernatural... There was indeed a time when Doctors were also performing seances!” Decades ago, wealthy intellectuals began installing psychomanteum in their homes; a secret room completely filled with mirrors, or a single mirror, and in complete darkness, in order to speak to the dead in other dimensions, and gain their knowledge. It was often used as a healing tool to help dissolve grief, or considered a form of prophecy. Necromanteum presents the concept: what if you could use that kind of room to speak with death, itself? What secrets of the world could you uncover from a direct conversation with the grim reaper? Not a monster, but a fellow intellect. “This album is for the fans,” states Lewis. “We're always striving to give you the best version of us, but it's only ours until we turn it in. Then it becomes everyone else's record. It's a form of entertainment, and we truly hope to help listeners break away from real life, and have some escape into our little world through the Necromanteum .”\"\n",

      "\"Although their music sometimes bears strong similarities to the technical, progressive brand of death metal centered around Gothenburg, Sweden and epitomized by bands like In Flames, Shadows Fall actually hail from Massachusetts. Guitarists Jonathan Donais and Matthew Bachand formed the band in 1996, and by the summer of the following year, the lineup had solidified with vocalist Phil Lebonte, bassist Paul Romanko, and drummer David Germain. Building their songs around the stop-start tempo and riff changes pioneered by bands like Metallica, Slayer, and Iron Maiden, the band toured New England and eventually snagged opening slots for acts like Fear Factory and Cannibal Corpse. Toward the end of 1997, they recorded a self-financed, self-released album titled Somber Eyes to the Sky, which eventually charted in CMJ's Loud Rock Top Ten and was picked up for overseas distribution. In 1998, Shadows Fall replaced Lebonte with former Overcast vocalist Brian Fair, a more versatile singer capable of handling melody as well as pure aggression. After further touring, the band scored a deal with Century Media in 1999; their first widely distributed domestic album, Of One Blood, was issued in early 2000. Soon after, Germain left the band and was replaced by drummer Jason Bittner. After releasing The Art of Balance in 2002 the band spent the summer of 2003 on the Ozzfest tour, gaining a larger fan base thanks to their intense live show. In turn, their 2004 album The War Within debuted at number 20 on the Billboard Top 200 charts. A collection of tracks left off the album appeared in 2006 as Fallout from the War. It was followed by Threads of Life in 2007 and Retribution in 2009. A world tour followed and resulted in the 2010 release of Madness in Manila: Shadows Fall Live in the Philippines 2009, followed by global touring and festival appearances. The band returned to the studio in 2011 and cut Fire from the Sky, which was issued in the spring of 2012. ~ Steve Huey\"\n",

Adding lead guitarist Brian Griffin and bassist Ed Hughes, the group's early demos soon earned them a contract with Grind Core Records, and in 1991 they issued their debut LP Swamped in Gore. Jumping to Metal Blade, Broken Hope resurfaced in 1993 with Bowels of Repugnance. Replacing Hughes with ex-Sindrome bassist Shaun Glass, the band next issued 1995's Repulsive Conception, followed two years later by Loathing. Both Stanek and Glass exited prior to recording 1999's Grotesque Blessings, and were replaced by drummer Duane Timlin and bassist Sean Baxter. It would prove to be the last record with this lineup and the last appearance of founding singer Ptacek who committed suicide a decade later. Having disbanded in 2002, surviving members Wagner and Glass reunited Broken Hope in 2012 with all new members including vocalist Damien Leski.

      "'Together with countrymen Kreator, Sodom, and Tankard, Germany\\'s Destruction make up the \"big four\" in Teutonic thrash metal. Like so many bands, they fell under the spell of the emergent New Wave of British Heavy Metal as classic metal met the D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, then evolved into thrash metal. Destruction was part of the second wave of thrash metal in the mid- to late \\'80s, along with American bands including Testament, Sacred Reich, Death Angel, and Dark Angel. Early albums, including 1985\\'s Eternal Devastation and 1987\\'s Release from Agony, are considered genre classics. While they disowned much of their self-released 1990s output, they roared back with 2000\\'s All Hell Breaks Loose for Nuclear Blast. They signed to AFM Records for 2005\\'s highly regarded Inventor of Evil, and 2008\\'s D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N. before returning to Nuclear Blast for 2016\\'s Under Attack. They signed with Napalm Records for 2022\\'s Diabolical.Formed in 1983 as Knight of Demon, the band changed its name to Destruction just weeks later. Further, their original sound, which was deeply indebted to Iron Maiden, shifted to one heavily influenced by Venom during the same period. The original lineup brought together towering vocalist/bassist Marcel Schirmer (aka Schmier), guitarist Mike Sifringer, and drummer Tommy Sandmann. Looking to take advantage of the bustling worldwide tape-trading network responsible for breaking most of the \\'80s biggest heavy metal bands, the trio immediately set about recording and circulating its Bestial Invasion demo to critics and fans alike. It wasn\\'t long before Germany\\'s premier metal label Steamhammer came calling with a record deal. Destruction\\'s Sentence of Death EP was released in 1984, and followed soon after by 1985\\'s Infernal Overkill LP. Both were surprisingly proficient, exceedingly well-received affairs fueled by raw aggression and youthful energy, and Destruction toured Germany with Slayer later that year before taking part in the legendary WWIII Festival in Montreal, Canada, alongside Celtic Frost, Voivod, and other extreme metal bands. After returning home, Destruction got to work on 1986\\'s universally acclaimed Eternal Devastation. Founding drummer Sandmann left the band shortly before a tour with countrymen Rage. Sodom\\'s Chris \"Witchhunter\" Dudeck stepped in until they found a permanent replacement in Oliver Kaiser. Additional guitarist Harry Wilkens was also recruited and, after testing this new lineup on 1987\\'s Mad Butcher EP, Destruction delivered what most critics and fans alike consider their finest album, 1988\\'s Release from Agony. That said, some fans took umbrage, as the newfangled quartet\\'s more technical, almost progressive direction rubbed purist constituents the wrong way. After being chosen as touring opener for Celtic Frost\\'s Cold Lake tour (an album the band disowned) they internal suffered discord on the road. Popular frontman Schmier was unceremoniously sacked shortly after the release of 1989\\'s Live Without Sense to make way for \"more capable\" replacements in vocalist Andre Grieder (ex-Poltergeist) and bassist Christian Engler. Feeling betrayed, upset fans made their feelings known by staying away in droves from 1990\\'s Cracked Brain album -- despite an overwhelmingly positive reception from critics -- as well as subsequent offerings like 1994\\'s Destruction, 1995\\'s Them Not Me (both EPs introducing new vocalist Thomas Rosenmerkel and guitarist Michael Piranio), and particularly, 1998\\'s career low The Least Successful Human Cannonball. Schmier formed a new band called Headhunter and busied himself with the operation of his own restaurant. He couldn\\'t, however, resist the opportunity to reunite with former partner-in-crime Sifringer and drummer Sven Vormann; the trio relaunched Destruction at the dawn of the new millennium and signed to Nuclear Blast. They issued All Hell Breaks Loose in 2000 to enthusiastic fan reception, while 2001\\'s The Antichrist, and 2003\\'s Metal Discharge (featuring drummer Marc Reign) were welcomed by critics and re-established their touring popularity. 2005\\'s Inventor of Evil, 2007\\'s Thrash Anthems, and 2008\\'s D.E.V.O.L.U.T.I.O.N. all appeared from AFM Records.Destruction returned to Nuclear Blast for 2011\\'s Day of Reckoning,'\n",

      "\"A savage and long-tenured California-based death metal unit with grindcore tendencies, Autopsy were founded in the late '80s by Eric Cutler and Chris Reifert, the latter of whom had just parted ways with pioneering Florida death metallers Death. Employing a caustic blend of thrash, doom, and death, the band released a string of influential albums like Severed Survival (1991) and Mental Funeral (1991) before shutting down operations in 1995. The group reconvened in 2010 and released an EP, The Tomb Within, followed by the uncompromising full-length Macabre Eternal. Having lost none of the sonic malice that made their earlier material so essential to the American death metal movement, the venerable decibel-pushers continued to tour and record, issuing punishing EPs like 2018's Puncturing the Grotesque and full-lengths (2013's The Headless Ritual, 2022's Morbidity Triumphant) with youthful regularity. Formed by ex-Death drummer Christ Reifert shortly after he relocated to San Francisco in 1987, punishing death metal unit Autopsy were rounded out by guitarists Eric Cutler and Danny Coralles and bassist Ken Sorvari, with Reifert also handling vocal duties. Signed to U.K.-based indie label Peaceville on the strength of 1988's Critical Madness demo, they released their debut, Severed Survival, two years later. Mirroring the work of fledgling English groups like Napalm Death and Carcass, the album combined traditional death metal vocals and aggression with slower, grinding riffs and utterly repellent splatter-gore lyrics. It also boasted a cameo from another Death alum, bassist Steve DiGiorgio, but Steve Cutler was handling the four-string workload come 1991 -- a busy year that saw them issuing two EPs, Fiend for Blood and Retribution for the Dead, as well as a long-player named Mental Funeral. None of these seemed to aid the band's cause, however, and neither did 1992's Acts of the Unspeakable album (featuring next bassist Josh Barohn), which is perhaps best remembered for cover artwork so shocking that Australian customs officials immediately confiscated all units upon arrival. A long period of inactivity followed, but Autopsy eventually returned for a semi-final gratuitous and scatological adieu via 1995's Shitfun album, featuring yet another bassist, one Freeway Migliore. Finally satisfied that they'd wreaked enough havoc, Reifert and Coralles moved on to a new project called Abscess and the former later joined Nuclear Assault's Danny Lilker in the Ravenous. A best-of set entitled Torn from the Grave was released in 2001, intended as a wrap-up, but in 2008, after reconvening to record two bonus tracks for the 20th anniversary edition of Severed Survival, the band announced plans to head back into the studio. The resulting Tomb Within EP arrived in 2010, followed in 2011 by the group's fifth studio long-player (and first since 1995), the remarkably resolute Macabre Eternal. The album featured the new core lineup of founders Reifert, Cutler, and Coralles, and new bass player Joe Trevisano, all of whom returned for 2013's Headless Ritual, 2014's Tourniquets, Hacksaws, and Graves, and 2022's Morbidity Triumphant. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Founding fathers of the Norwegian black metal scene, Mayhem emerged in the mid-\\'80s and went on to influence countless bands with their uncompromisingly abrasive music and sordid history. The group courted controversy from their inception with their blood-soaked live performances, occult imagery, and ghoulish corpse paint. Their legend grew in the \\'90s with their connection to a spate of Norwegian church burnings, the suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin (\"Dead\"), and the murder of guitarist Øystein Aarseth (\"Euronymous\") by ex-member Varg Vikernes (\"Count Grishnackh\"). Though the band continued to perform and record well into the next century -- they issued their sixth LP, Daemon, in 2019 -- they remain infamous for their non-musical history and their 1994 debut, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, which is considered a classic of the genre. Inspired by bands like Bathory, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, Slayer, Celtic Frost, and Venom -- they took their name from the latter group\\'s song \"Mayhem and Mercy\" -- Mayhem came together in 1984 around bassist Necrobutcher (Jørn Stubberud), guitarist Euronymous (Oystein Aarseth), and drummer Kjetil Manheim. After releasing the demo Pure Fucking Armageddon, the trio recruited vocalist Maniac (Sven Erik Kristiansen), who made his studio debut on the band\\'s 1987 debut EP Deathcrush. Manheim and Maniac left the fold the following year and were replaced by drummer Hellhammer (Jan Axel Blomberg) and vocalist Dead (Per Yngve Ohlin), the latter of whom became notorious for his commitment to his chosen moniker: depressed and introverted, Dead was known to hoard deceased animals, bury his clothes in the ground the night before a show, and cut himself extensively on-stage. Congruent with their lead singer\\'s death obsession, Mayhem\\'s live shows became a lurid spectacle, a swirling mosh pit/meat grinder awash in human blood and dead animal parts. The band moved to a house in Oslo in 1990 to begin working on material for their first full-length effort. During this time, Euronymous opened his own record store, Helvete, which served as a hub for the burgeoning Norwegian black metal scene. On April 8, 1991, Dead slit both of his wrists and then finished the job with a shotgun. Euronymous, upon finding his bandmate\\'s body, discovered a suicide note that commenced with \"Excuse the blood,\" and included lyrics for the song \"Life Eternal,\" which, many years later, would appear on the group\\'s debut album. He then left the scene to buy a disposable camera, and after returning, rearranged some items and took photographs of the corpse, one of which was used as the front cover of the 1995 bootleg live LP The Dawn of the Black Hearts. Shaken by the death of his friend and bandmate, bassist and co-founder Necrobutcher left the group, leaving just Hellhammer and Euronymous, the latter of whom had taken to wearing a necklace he had made with pieces of Dead\\'s skull. In 1992, the duo recruited a trio of session musicians (Burzum\\'s Varg Vikernes on bass, Thorn\\'s Snorre Ruch on guitar, and Tormentor\\'s Attila Csihar on vocals) and began laying down tracks for their debut full-length effort. The following year, Euronymous was forced to close Helvete due to an increasing media and police presence brought about by Dead\\'s suicide, a string of high-profile church burnings, and other associated acts of violence: Euronymous and Vikernes had been conspiring to blow up Nidaros Cathedral ahead of the release of the album. The plan never came to fruition, however, as Vikernes murdered Euronymous on August 10, 1993, stabbing him 23 times outside of Euronymous\\' Oslo apartment. Vikernes was arrested and later convicted of both murder and arson and went on to spend 15 years in prison. Ruch (aka Blackthorn), who had made the 518-kilometer drive from Bergen with Vikernes to confront Euronymous but waited downstairs, received an eight-year sentence for complicity in murder, leaving Csihar and Hellhammer as the sole remaining members of the group.Seven years in the making, the punishing De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, featuring Euronymous on guitar and lyrics penned by Dead, was issued in 1994 and became one of the most influential black metal albums of all time; the concert LP Live in Leipzig, recorded in 1990, arrived the year prior. The initial release of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas was delayed due to complications arising from complaints made by Euronymous\\' parents regarding Vikernes bass parts, which they wanted to be re-recorded by someone else. Hellhammer elected to keep the bass tracks unchanged. Later that year, Necrobutcher and Maniac re-joined Mayhem, as did new guitarist Blasphemer (Rune Eriksen), and the newly minted four-piece unveiled the Wolf\\'s Lair Abyss EP in 1997. In 2000, Mayhem released their sophomore full-length effort, the conceptual Grand Declaration of War, which saw them take a more progressive/avant-garde metal approach, with Maniac trading his signature rasp for something more akin to spoken word. 2004\\'s Chimera marked a return to the icy black metal of their debut, albeit with a slightly more polished and progressive bent. It would also serve as the last outing for Maniac, who left the group amidst a flurry of inner-band turmoil. Attila Csihar was reinstated on vocals for 2007\\'s acclaimed Ordo as Chao, which received the Spellemannprisen (the Norwegian equivalent of a Grammy Award) for Best Heavy Metal Album in 2008. Blasphemer was the next to depart, with a rotating cadre of guitarists assuming his role on-stage. Teloch (Morten Iverson), of fellow black metallers Nidingr, and Ghul (Charles Hedger) were eventually added to the lineup and made their studio debuts on 2014\\'s Esoteric Warfare, the band\\'s first outing for Season of Mist. 2018 saw the release of the Jonas Åkerlund (Bathory)-directed feature film Lords of Chaos, which was based on the popular 1998 book of the same name and chronicled the birth of the Norwegian black metal scene, with special attention given to the bloody history of Mayhem. Daemon, the group\\'s raw and unfettered sixth studio long-player, followed in 2019 and was released through Century Media. An EP, Atavistic Black Disorder/Kommando, arrived in 2021 and featured additional material from the Daemon sessions. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

Their fans celebrate the band\\'s particular brand of extreme metal: It is lyrically obsessed with the occult, Satanism, and anti-Christian blasphemy. Though it kept them out of the mainstream for decades, later albums including 2014\\'s Dirges of Elysium and 2017\\'s Profane Nexus attained respectable placement on music industry and streaming charts. The band was founded in New Jersey by guitarist John McEntee and drummer/vocalist Paul Ledney in 1989. Ledney left after the release of Reh.1.3.90, the band\\'s first demo, because he wanted to play black metal rather than death metal. The band\\'s first lead vocalist was Will Rahmer (founder of Mortician). Rahmer appeared on Incantation\\'s debut EP, Entrapment of Evil, which was released on the tiny Seraphic Decay label. It wasn\\'t long before Rahmer was replaced by Craig Pillard, who stayed with the band for several years. After signing with Relapse in 1991, Incantation recorded their second EP, Deliverance of Horrific Prophecies, before providing their first full-length album, Onward to Golgotha (which employed Pillard on vocals and Jim \"Eno\" Roe on drums) in 1992. Incantation\\'s subsequent Relapse albums included Mortal Throne of Nazarene in 1994, Upon the Throne of Apocalypse in 1996, Forsaken Mourning of Angelic Anguish in 1997, and Diabolical Conquest in 1998. After 2000\\'s Infernal Storm, Incantation left Relapse and signed with Candlelight for 2002\\'s Blasphemy.McEntee (the only remaining member of the original lineup) began his tenure as the band\\'s guitarist and lyricist, but after signing the band to Listenable Records in late 2003, he took over as lead vocalist. His debut was 2004\\'s Decimate Christendom wherein Incantation was slimmed down to a trio; they remained in that configuration for 2006\\'s Primordial Domination. After supporting the album by touring for two-and-a-half years, McEntee put the group on temporary hiatus. They returned in November of 2012 with Vanquish in Vengeance as a quartet with McEntee, drummer Kyle Severn, lead guitarist Alex Bouks, and bassist Chuck Sherwood (the latter replaced Joe Lombard, who died by suicide in January). Given the album\\'s laudatory critical reception, Incantation hit the road for more than a year, touring primarily in Europe. Upon return, they entered the studio and delivered Dirges of Elysium, their final date for Listenable. It arrived in 2014 with their first music video for single \"Impalement of Divinity.\" The album defied the band\\'s expectations and reached the middle rungs of the Heatseekers chart. Incantation undertook another years-long touring jaunt. While they were on the road working, New Jersey\\'s Necroharmonic Productions issued the two-disc Unholy Massacre, a compilation of early sides, and the live Rotting Spiritual Embodiment, also comprised of \\'90s material. Upon return to the U.S. Incantation lost Bouks to Ruinous, and re-signed to Relapse. The power trio of McEntee, Severn, and Sherwood released Profane Nexus, in August of 2017, their tenth studio long-player. Mixed and mastered by Dan Swanö, it reached the Top 40 on the Independent albums chart. A video for \"Lus Sepulcri\" racked up over 100,000 views -- a sizable number for an indie metal band. Incantation played festivals in Europe, South America, and the United States as part of the Relapse-sponsored Contamination Tour with Dying Fetus, Genocide Pact, and Gatecreeper. The label issued Contamination Tour 2018 EP, a split containing two tracks each by all four bands. Incantation became a touring quartet again with temporary lead guitarist Sonny Lombarddozzi. They headlined American stages through most of 2019. Toward year\\'s end, Incantation re-entered the studio with Swanö. Lombardozzi played lead on the lion\\'s share of tracks, but his permanent replacement, Luke Shively, was already in the wings, and helmed the remainder. Incantation issued a couple of well-received advance video singles -- \"Fury\\'s Manifest\" in July and \"Entrails of the Hag Queen\" in early August -- that created anticipation for the full-length release Sect of Vile Divinities issued on August 21. The band was prevented from touring in 2020 due to travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this drawback, the album sold more out of the box than any of its predecessors. It debuted inside the Top 50 on three music industry charts and the Top 40 on various metal streaming lists. ~ Thom Jurek &amp; Alex Henderson, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Annihilist are a metal band from Melbourne, Australia. Their debut EP ‘Vol. 1', released in Nov 2015, blurs the lines between European melodic death metal and the new wave of American heavy metal all tied together with nicely progressive song writing. Live performances are a vital aspect to Annihilist, the overly charismatic singer Harry Pendock always turning heads at shows with his often theatrical behaviour, adding a much needed element of fun to what is all too often perceived as a serious genre.Two music videos for ‘Vol. 1', ‘Solace In Suffering' and ‘Embers' have so far been released, both shot and directed by Annihilist's own guitarist Miki Simankevicius. The videos are a glimpse into the bands live show in a desolate setting of swamps and decayed flora. The last 18 months have seen Annihilist perform all over Victoria alongside some of Australia's elite metal acts including Hollow World, Boris The Blade, Chronolyth, Whoretopsy, The Hazard Circular and Ruins. The next 18 months for Annihilist include further shows interstate with plans for a second release in 2017 and hopes to take their music overseas.\"\n",

      "\"The New Jersey quintet, LORNA SHORE, has returned and upped their sonic ante with new album, Pain Remains. “This was the hardest record that we've ever had to write,” says guitarist Adam De Micco. “The title came out when I was writing the album,” recalls Adam. “I had a lot going on personally. A lot of loss – and that came out in the songwriting.” Nothing makes that more apparent than the three-part album-shuttering opus, “Pain Remains” that stretches over 20 minutes, bludgeoning the listener with a sense of scale and raw emotion with Will venting over a tidal of cascading riffs, animalistic growls and swelling synths. “I always wanted to write a really sad death metal song, a deathcore love song,” says vocalist Will Ramos. “When I first heard the music, it had so much emotion – have you ever fallen in love in a dream and woken up and realized that none of it was real? It's about chasing that emotion.”From the opening choral chants and orchestration (composed by guitarist Andrew O'Connor) of “Welcome Back, O' Sleeping Dreamer” straight into labyrinth of musical twists, turns, technicalities and raw emotion at the core of tracks like “Sun//Eater” or “Soulless Existence”, LORNA SHORE has woven together a sprawling document of ambition, soul and ability that few can match. Clocking in at just over an hour, Pain Remains is as far-reaching in scope as any modern extreme metal album. It thinks big, pushing beyond preconception or musical boundaries.\"\n",

      "'Rooted at the crossroads of aggressive metal and beat-driven hip-hop, Linkin Park became one of the most successful acts of the early 21st century by incorporating elements from across genres, injecting hardcore rap, raucous punk, atmospheric electronic, and even polished pop stylings into their music. Despite being burdened with the oft-derided nu-metal and rap-rock genre designations, they soon evolved beyond those associations into a more complex beast. Indeed, as their original band name and debut album title suggested, they were a hybrid of forces, relying as much on the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and rapper Mike Shinoda as on the band\\'s muscled instrumentation, which layered DJ Hahn\\'s effects atop heavy, processed guitars and pounding percussion. No matter their direction, pain and catharsis remained at their core. From the commercial peak of their hip-hop-influenced, multi-platinum breakthrough albums Hybrid Theory (2000) and Meteora (2003), into a brief electronic phase (2010\\'s A Thousand Suns), and ultimately to their final pop moment (2017\\'s One More Light), they stayed ahead of the curve without sacrificing heaviness or chart success. Months after the release of their seventh and final album as the founding lineup, frontman Chester Bennington passed away, closing the book on a nearly two-decade run that included five chart-topping albums and tens of millions of records sold across the globe.Drummer Rob Bourdon, guitarist Brad Delson, and MC/vocalist Mike Shinoda attended high school in Southern California, where they formed the rap-rock band Xero in 1996. Bassist Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, singer Mark Wakefield, and DJ/art student Joseph Hahn joined soon after, and the band courted various labels while playing hometown shows in Los Angeles. Few companies expressed interest in Xero\\'s self-titled demo tape, however, prompting Wakefield to leave the lineup (he would later resurface as the manager for Taproot). When replacement singer Chester Bennington climbed aboard in 1998 -- sharing vocal duties with Shinoda in what would become a crucial part of their signature sound -- they rebranded as Hybrid Theory and issued an eponymous EP. Still struggling to find an audience, they finally caught the attention of Warner Bros. and chose a new name: Linkin Park, a misspelled reference to Lincoln Park in Santa Monica. With support from Warner Bros. vice-president Jeff Blue, the band entered the studio with Don Gilmore shortly thereafter to record what would become a diamond-certified worldwide smash.Linkin Park titled their debut album Hybrid Theory, a tribute to the band\\'s past, and released the record during the fall of 2000. \"Crawling\" and \"In the End\" were massive radio hits; the latter song even topped the U.S. Modern Rock chart while peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, an example of the group\\'s crossover appeal. Linkin Park joined the Family Values Tour and played shows with Cypress Hill, leading the band to log over 320 shows in 2001 alone. Come January 2002, Hybrid Theory had received three Grammy nominations and sold over seven million copies. (Sales later topped ten million, earning the album \"diamond status\" and making Hybrid Theory one of the most successful debuts ever.) Despite their meteoric rise, however, Linkin Park spent the remainder of the year holed up in the recording studio, again working with producer Don Gilmore on a follow-up album. Meanwhile, the timely summer release of the platinum Reanimation helped appease the band\\'s eager audience, offering remixed versions of Hybrid Theory\\'s tracks by famous faces from bands such as Korn, Deftones, Orgy, Jurassic 5, the Roots, Taproot, Marilyn Manson, Staind, and Dilated Peoples.Facing overwhelming expectations, Linkin Park\\'s official sophomore effort, Meteora, arrived in March 2003. The chart-topping record spawned several modern rock hits, including \"Numb,\" \"Somewhere I Belong,\" and \"Breaking the Habit,\" which furthered the band\\'s crossover appeal by simultaneously charting on the Hot 100. The group once again supported the album with ample touring, including performances with the second annual Projekt Revolution Tour (the band\\'s own traveling festival, which originally launched in 2002) and additional shows with the likes of Metallica and Limp Bizkit. Live in Texas was released to document the group\\'s strength as a touring act, and the bandmates tackled various personal projects before beginning work on a second remix project. Released in 2004, Collision Course found the band collaborating with rapper Jay-Z, resulting in a number of mashups that sampled from both artists\\' catalogs. Collision Course topped the charts upon its release, the first EP to do so since Alice in Chains\\' Jar of Flies, and Jay-Z furthered his association with the band by asking co-founder Mike Shinoda to explore the possibility of a solo hip-hop project. He did, dubbing the project Fort Minor and releasing The Rising Tied in 2005 with Jay-Z as executive producer. Linkin Park then reconvened in 2006 to begin work on a third studio album, which saw Shinoda sharing production credits with Rick Rubin. The resulting Minutes to Midnight, a more traditional rock affair that largely left behind their trademark hip-hop heart, arrived in 2007, debuting at number one in several countries and spawning the Top Ten single \"What I\\'ve Done.\" In between albums, the group contributed the theme to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, \"New Divide,\" which became one of their most enduring hits.In 2010, Linkin Park returned to the studio with Rubin to produce their fourth studio album. Veering off-course once again, A Thousand Suns was a left-field experimental project based largely in ambient electronica, which divided their fans. Nevertheless, singles \"The Catalyst\" and \"Waiting for the End\" were both chart-topping hits. The following year, Bennington stated the band\\'s desire to focus more on putting out new material rather than maintaining an exhaustive touring schedule, with the group having a goal of releasing a new album every 18 months. Linkin Park made good on that promise in 2012 with their Rick Rubin-produced fifth LP, Living Things, which saw something of a return to their hybrid sound of yore. Upon its June release, the album debuted at the top of the Billboard charts, selling over 223,000 copies in its first week. It would soon be certified gold, and the singles \"Burn It Down,\" \"Lost in the Echo,\" and \"Castle of Glass\" maintained the band\\'s presence on international singles charts.As Linkin Park began work on their sixth studio album in the spring of 2013, Bennington announced that he was replacing Scott Weiland as the lead vocalist of Stone Temple Pilots; he was not leaving Linkin Park, but instead planned to be in both groups simultaneously. Bennington underscored his commitment to both bands in October 2013 by releasing his debut EP with STP, High Rise, and appearing with Linkin Park on the remix album Recharged that same month. The latter album\\'s lead single, \"A Light That Never Comes,\" recorded in collaboration with DJ Steve Aoki, was a worldwide club hit. Another Aoki collaboration, \"Darker Than Blood,\" was featured on the DJ\\'s Neon Future II and entered the Top 50 on both Billboard dance and electronic charts.In June 2014, Linkin Park unveiled The Hunting Party, their sixth effort. The album -- produced by the bandmembers themselves -- was inspired by the punk, metal, and hardcore they had listened to as teens. The resulting collection was loud, raw, and heavy, featuring guest appearances by Tom Morello, System of a Down\\'s Daron Malakian, Helmet\\'s Page Hamilton, and hip-hop legend Rakim. Although it was kept out of the top spot on the U.S. charts, it hit number one in half-a-dozen countries around the world, and became one of the year\\'s biggest sellers in hard rock circles. After promotion for The Hunting Party concluded, the band returned to the drawing board for a follow-up. When Linkin Park emerged from the studio in 2017, they were accompanied by a drastic shift in their sound that proved to be divisive. Lead single \"Heavy,\" a duet featuring singer Kiiara and production by pop songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter, was a taste of things to come on the band\\'s seventh effort, One More Light. Despite the clear pop trajectory, it became their fifth number one album and was soon certified gold. Barely two months after its release and one week before beginning a major American tour, Bennington was found dead at his home in Southern California; he was 41.On October 27, 2017, months after Bennington\\'s tragic passing, the group hosted a tribute concert for their late singer, Linkin Park and Friends: Celebrate Life in Honor of Chester Bennington. An all-star roster of friends joined the band at the Hollywood Bowl, including members of blink-182, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold, Yellowcard, Bring Me the Horizon, System of a Down, No Doubt, Orgy, One OK Rock, Bush, and Sum 41, as well as Zedd, Machine Gun Kelly, Alanis Morissette, and Steve Aoki. They closed the era with a release compiling Bennington\\'s final performances with the band, One More Light: Live. Following Bennington\\'s death, Linkin Park went on indefinite hiatus, although they continued working on a number of archival projects. In late 2020, they celebrated the 20th anniversary of their breakthrough with a set that bundled Hybrid Theory with bonuses that included live recordings and rarities. Featured on the album was the song \"She Couldn\\'t,\" which was recorded in 1999 but never officially released. A remix of the group\\'s debut single, \"One Step Closer,\" by electronic duo 100 gecs appeared in January 2021. The next retrospective collection arrived in 2023 to celebrate the Meteora era. In similar fashion, this hulking box set included the original album, live concerts from Texas and Nottingham, a slew of rarities and demos, and more. Additionally, Meteora20 included a handful of previously unreleased songs, including \"Fighting Myself\" and \"Lost,\" the latter of which returned the band to the international Top Ten. ~ Neil Z.

      "'Guns N\\' Roses are the bridge separating 1980s and 1990s hard rock, the band responsible for ushering in an era of grim, gritty rock &amp; roll. Where such peers as Mötley Crüe reveled in the decadence of Sunset Strip sleaze, Guns N\\' Roses focused on the grimy underbelly of the urban jungle, with guitarists Slash and Izzy Stradlin cranking out mean riffs that matched the dark fantasies of Axl Rose, the vocalist who led GNR with a serpentine charm. Rose countered his nasty tendencies with a romantic side, one that flourished on \"Sweet Child O\\' Mine,\" the soaring ballad that went to number one in 1988, turning the band into superstars in the process. Over the next few years, GNR\\'s 1987 debut album, Appetite for Destruction, sold in monstrous numbers, with \"Welcome to the Jungle\" and \"Paradise City\" both reaching Billboard\\'s Top Ten and \"Patience,\" from the 1989 EP GNR Lies, also reaching that exalted position. During this peak, Guns N\\' Roses were lightning rods for controversy, so they avoided trouble by whiling away in the studio crafting their sequel to Appetite for Destruction, the sprawling twin albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II. Released simultaneously in September 1991, the Illusions still were rooted in hard rock, but Rose also pursued majestic, melodramatic balladry, a trait that reached its apotheosis in \"November Rain,\" a ballad that became their last Top Ten hit in 1992. By that point, Guns N\\' Roses were no longer the paragons of grubby hard rock, not after Nirvana ushered in the grunge revolution of the early \\'90s. The rise of alternative rock coincided with the erosion of the original GNR lineup, a slow attrition that left Axl Rose as the lone remaining founding member by the end of the \\'90s. He spent much of the 2000s working on his magnum opus Chinese Democracy, which he delivered in 2008, by which point the group were so out of the mainstream thar they weren\\'t even considered retro-hip. The situation would eventually change. By 2015, Slash and bassist Duff McKagan rejoined Guns N Roses, providing the band with a core of original members that would help this be a stable lineup into the 2020s, when the group showed signs of returning to active recording status via the 2022 EP Hard Skool. Guns N\\' Roses released their first EP in 1986, which led to a contract with Geffen; the following year, the band released their debut album, Appetite for Destruction. They started to build a following with their numerous live shows, but the album didn\\'t start selling until almost a year later, when MTV began playing \"Sweet Child O\\' Mine.\" Soon, both the album and single shot to number one, and Guns N\\' Roses became one of the biggest bands in the world. Their debut single, \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" was re-released and shot into the Top Ten, and \"Paradise City\" followed in its footsteps. By the end of 1988, they released G N\\' R Lies, which paired four new, acoustic-based songs (including the Top Five hit \"Patience\") with their first EP. G N\\' R Lies\\' inflammatory closer, \"One in a Million,\" sparked intense controversy, as Rose slipped into misogyny, bigotry, and pure violence; essentially, he somehow managed to distill every form of prejudice and hatred into one five-minute tune.Guns N\\' Roses began work on the long-awaited follow-up to Appetite for Destruction at the end of 1990. In October of that year, the band fired Adler, claiming that his drug dependency caused him to play poorly; he was replaced by Matt Sorum from the Cult. During recording, the band added Dizzy Reed on keyboards. By the time the sessions were finished, the new album had become two new albums. After being delayed for nearly a year, the albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II were released in September 1991. Messy but fascinating, the records showcased a more ambitious band; while there were still a fair number of full-throttle guitar rockers, there were stabs at Elton John-style balladry, acoustic blues, horn sections, female backup singers, ten-minute art rock epics with several different sections, and a good number of introspective, soul-searching lyrics. In short, Guns N\\' Roses were now making art; amazingly, they were successful at it. The albums sold very well initially, but while they had seemed destined to set the pace for the decade to come, that turned out not to be the case at all.Nirvana\\'s Nevermind hit number one in early 1992, suddenly making Guns N\\' Roses -- with all of their pretensions, impressionistic videos, models, and rock star excesses -- seem very uncool. Rose handled the change by becoming a dictator, or at least a petty tyrant; his in-concert temper tantrums became legendary, even going so far as to incite a riot in Montreal. Stradlin left by the end of 1991, and with his departure the band lost their best songwriter; he was replaced by ex-Kills for Thrills guitarist Gilby Clarke. GNR didn\\'t fully grasp the shift in hard rock until 1993, when they released an album of punk covers, The Spaghetti Incident?; it received some good reviews, but the band failed to capture the reckless spirit of not only the original versions but their own Appetite for Destruction. By the middle of 1994, there were rumors flying that GNR were about to break up, since Rose wanted to pursue a new, more industrial direction and Slash wanted to stick with their blues-inflected hard rock. The band remained in limbo for several more years, and Slash resurfaced in 1995 with the side project Slash\\'s Snakepit and an LP, It\\'s Five O\\'Clock Somewhere.Rose remained out of the spotlight, becoming a virtual recluse and doing nothing but tinkering in the studio; he also recruited various musicians -- including Dave Navarro, Tommy Stinson, and ex-Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck -- for informal jam sessions. Remaining members were infuriated by Rose\\'s inclusion of childhood friend Paul Huge in the new sessions when both Stradlin and Clarke were excluded from rejoining the band. And a remake of the Rolling Stones\\' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" was essentially the straw that broke the camel\\'s back, as Rose cut out some of the other members\\' contributions and pasted Huge over the song without consulting anyone else. By 1996, Slash was officially out of Guns N\\' Roses, leaving Rose the lone remaining survivor from the group\\'s heyday; rumors continued to swirl, and still no new material was forthcoming, though Rose did re-record Appetite for Destruction with a new lineup for rehearsal purposes. The first new original GNR song in eight years, the industrial metal track \"Oh My God\" finally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1999 Arnold Schwarzenegger film End of Days. Soon after, Geffen issued the two-disc Live Era: \\'87-\\'93.The year 2000 brought the addition of guitarists Robin Finck (of Nine Inch Nails) and Buckethead, and 2001 was greeted with Guns N\\' Roses\\' first live dates in nearly seven years, as the band (which consisted of Rose plus guitarists Finck and Buckethead, bassist Stinson, former Primus drummer Brian \"Brain\" Mantia, childhood friend and guitarist Paul Huge, and longtime GNR keyboardist Dizzy Reed) played a show on New Year\\'s Eve 2000 in Las Vegas; they also performed at the mammoth Rock in Rio festival the following month. On New Year\\'s Eve 2001, the band played almost the exact same set as the year before.An appearance at MTV\\'s 2002 Video Music Awards helped garner interest in the new lineup, but a rusty performance from Rose and an interview where he said his new album wasn\\'t coming out anytime soon didn\\'t do much to further their cause. That summer, GNR started on their first tour in almost eight years, and they managed to fulfill all of their commitments in Europe and Asia. Sadly, they caused a violent and destructive riot in Vancouver when Rose failed to show up for the first date of their North American tour. While he was up to his old shenanigans with the retooled lineup, former Stone Temple Pilots vocalist Scott Weiland, Slash, Sorum, and McKagan formed the successful Velvet Revolver in spring 2002.And so years passed and still no new GNR album, to the point where it became one joke too many. The album was long billed as Chinese Democracy, and occasionally session recordings would leak and make their way onto Internet file-sharing networks. A fascinating article written by Jeff Leeds for The New York Times, published in March 2005, revealed how tangled and costly the making of the album had become. According to the article, titled \"The Most Expensive Album Never Released,\" Rose began work on the album in 1994 and racked up production costs of at least 13 million dollars. Producers involved with the album at one time or another included Mike Clink, Youth, Sean Beavan, and even Roy Thomas Baker. (Curiously, Moby claimed to have been offered the job as well.) Marco Beltrami and Paul Buckmaster were allegedly brought in for orchestral arrangements, and there was a revolving door of guitarists; Buckethead left the band in 2004, and Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal eventually took his place. In 2006, the record seemed closer to release, as Rose began surfacing in public and even took his band on the road for some shows. The music industry\\'s biggest boondoggle finally bore fruit in 2008, when Axl unveiled an album that was well over a decade in the making. While Chinese Democracy received many rave reviews, and the critical response was positive overall, the record underperformed (its almost impossible) expectations, debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 when it came out in November. A worldwide tour followed. Guitarist DJ Ashba of Sixx:A.M. joined Guns N\\' Roses in 2009, and the band continued working on new material and playing shows, with some of the group\\'s former members occasionally dropping in for guest appearances. In 2012, GNR\\'s classic lineup was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, and Slash, McKagan, Clarke, Adler, and Sorum reunited and performed a few Appetite-era songs with vocalist Myles Kennedy replacing Rose, who had declined to participate. Bumblefoot left the group in 2014, and in July 2015, Ashba announced that he had departed from the band as well. In 2016, GNR embarked on the Not in This Lifetime...Tour, which featured Rose alongside a reunited lineup with guitarist Slash, bassist Duff McKagan, and several longtime touring members. The tour, whose title was a reference to a quote Rose gave in 2012, also found original drummer Steven Adler joining the band for several stops. A remastered version of Appetite for Destruction arrived in 2018 and included a previously unreleased single, \"Shadow of Your Love,\" recorded by the original lineup. The group continued to tour throughout 2020 and 2021, debuting several songs, including \"Absurd\" and \"Hard Skool,\" the latter of which worked as the title track to the 2022 EP Hard Skool. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'The members of Three Days Grace began bashing out punk chords when they were in their teens, carving a workmanlike yet energetic sound that fueled their live performances. Combining elements of angst-fueled alternative rock, metal, and grunge, the Canadian group quickly established themselves as lynchpins of the post-grunge movement. Emerging in 2003, the band soared to the top of the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart with platinum-selling efforts like One-X (2006) and Life Starts Now (2009), and have remained at the fore of the hard rock scene in the 2010s and beyond with internationally charting outings such as Human (2015), Outsider (2018), and Explosions (2022). Three Days Grace were formed in Norwood, Ontario, Canada, in 1997 by Adam Gontier (vocals, guitar), Brad Walst (bass), and Neil Sanderson (drums). The group was originally called Groundswell, a five-piece that lasted from 1992 until transforming into a trio five years later. Gontier and Walst were raised in Norwood, and many of their songs were inspired by living in a place with a population of around 1,500. The bandmembers were still in high school when they had their first gig, and they performed anywhere that would accept them -- including opening at a movie. Three Days Grace eventually relocated to Toronto and were introduced to producer Gavin Brown by their old manager. The band gave Brown a private set, and he selected what he felt were the most promising tracks. The group then produced a demo for EMI Music Publishing Canada. With Brown at the helm, Three Days Grace recorded \"(I Hate) Everything About You.\" The tune got them a publishing deal with EMI and soon they were signed to Jive after being courted by the company\\'s president. Brown and Three Days Grace were sent to a studio in Boston, Massachusetts, to start the group\\'s debut album. The band completed its self-titled full-length in Woodstock, New York, at an isolated location free from big-city distractions. Heavily influenced by Kyuss and Sunny Day Real Estate, the dark, angst-ridden tales of small-town love and hate on Three Days Grace brought the group a Next Big Thing tag. Three Days Grace was released on July 22, 2003, by which time \"(I Hate) Everything About You\" was already a hit on alternative radio stations in Canada. The band toured extensively behind the record for the next two years as both a supporting act and headliners, but after a while, life on the road left the band, especially Gontier, feeling isolated and alone. Consequently, this theme of disconnection -- coupled with the realization that one was, in fact, not alone -- would serve as the basis for their follow-up album. Getting back to their roots by writing the record in the Ontario countryside, One-X was released in June 2006. The album, which hit number five on the Billboard Top 200, marked the recorded debut of the band\\'s second guitarist, Barry Stock. Three Days Grace supported One-X throughout the summer on dates alongside Staind, Hoobastank, and Nickelback, while \"Animal I Have Become\" became a number one modern rock hit. In 2009, the group released its third full-length album, Life Starts Now, which reached number three on Billboard\\'s album chart. After heading out on tour with bands like Nickelback and Avenged Sevenfold, the group returned to the studio to record its fourth album, the more atmospheric, electronic-tinged Transit of Venus. Again, they charted in the Top Five of the Billboard 200. In early 2013, Gontier left the band, citing a health issue, and was replaced by Brad Walst\\'s brother, singer Matt Walst of My Darkest Days. After touring and recording with their new singer, two singles, \"Painkiller\" and \"I Am Machine,\" were released in 2014 and both reached number one on Billboard\\'s Mainstream Rock Songs chart. The band\\'s fifth album, the darker, loss-inspired Human, followed in the spring of 2015. In July 2017, Three Days Grace issued the single \"The Mountain\" ahead of the release of their sixth studio long-player, the well-received Outsider, which arrived in early 2018 and earned nominations for Album of the Year and Rock Album of the Year at the 2019 Juno Awards. Recorded partially in isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, Three Days Grace\\'s seventh album was heavy with themes of centering one\\'s self in a world of chaos. Released in 2022, Explosions was co-produced with Howard Benson. ~ Michael Sutton, Rovi'\n",

      "'Nickelback carried the torch for heavy post-grunge into the 2000s, an era that otherwise didn\\'t favor their particular brand of pumped-up angst and loud good times. By most measures, the Canadian group were the most popular rockers of the 2000s, ruling rock radio from the moment \"How You Remind Me\" went to number one in both Canada and the U.S. after its release in 2001. Over the next decade, the group dominated the rock charts, balancing crossover power ballads like \"Someday\" and \"Photograph\" with salacious rockers like \"Rock Star\" and \"Something in Your Mouth.\" During the band\\'s reign, Nickelback\\'s presence seemed outsized thanks to its gruff-voiced leader Chad Kroeger stepping outside the group to record \"Hero\" for the soundtrack for Sam Raimi\\'s 2002 theatrical adaptation of Spider-Man, along with appearing on records by Santana and Kroeger\\'s then-wife Avril Lavigne -- cameos that indicate how the band\\'s popularity extended beyond die-hard rock audiences. Nevertheless, those were the fans that stayed true to Nickelback, helping the band stay successful through the 2010s and into 2022, when the crunching \"San Quentin\" became the band\\'s first American Top Ten Rock hit in nearly a decade. Chad Kroeger honed his frontman skills by performing with cover bands in Hanna, a small Canadian town 215 kilometers northeast of Calgary. After growing tired of playing other people\\'s songs, he borrowed money from his stepfather and relocated to Vancouver, where he recorded his first batch of original material. Mike Kroeger, Chad\\'s bass-playing sibling, decided to join his brother\\'s band, as did fellow Vancouver transplants Ryan Peake (a guitarist who had befriended the Kroegers in middle school) and Ryan Vikedal (a drummer from Peake\\'s hometown of Brooks, Alberta). Nickelback officially took shape in 1995 and quickly set to work, releasing two albums -- the Hesher EP and full-length album Curb -- in 1996. By 1998, the bandmates were managing themselves; Chad courted radio stations, brother Mike handled distribution, Vikedal booked shows, and Peake maintained the band\\'s website. January 2000 saw the arrival of The State, Nickelback\\'s second independent release. Issued at a time in which Canadian content requirements were increased (and, accordingly, local radio stations had begun to desperately seek out homegrown product), the album fared very well on indie charts. Nickelback toured ceaselessly in support of The State, logging approximately 200 shows while playing alongside other groups of the burgeoning post-grunge genre. Their commercial appeal wasn\\'t lost on the record industry, either, and The State\\'s distribution rights were quickly snapped up by Roadrunner Records in the U.S. and EMI in Canada. As the band continued to tour, Kroeger kept writing new songs, many of which were polished in front of live audiences. Much of that material found its way onto Silver Side Up, which was produced by Rick Parashar (who rose to prominence in the early \\'90s by helming Pearl Jam\\'s Ten, Alice in Chains\\' Sap, and Blind Melon\\'s self-titled debut) and recorded at Green House, the same Vancouver studio used for The State\\'s creation. The combination of Nickelback\\'s growing popularity and Kroeger\\'s focused songwriting propelled Silver Side Up onto album charts across the world, spearheaded by the hit single \"How You Remind Me.\" Kroeger capitalized on that exposure by producing another Vancouver-based band, Default, and collaborating with Saliva\\'s Josey Scott for the Spider-Man soundtrack. The Long Road then arrived in 2003, featuring an increasingly polished sound and another high-charting single, \"Someday.\" While some listeners criticized the apparent similarities between \"Someday\" and \"How You Remind Me,\" The Long Road had little trouble maintaining Nickelback\\'s wide audience, eventually selling over five million copies worldwide. In February 2005, Nickelback announced the departure of Vikedal. He was soon replaced by 3 Doors Down\\'s former drummer Daniel Adair, and Nickelback returned to Kroeger\\'s studio in Vancouver to begin work on another album. ZZ Top\\'s Billy Gibbons and Pantera\\'s Dimebag Darrell (who unfortunately died before the album\\'s release) were guests on the chart-topping All the Right Reasons, which arrived in October 2005. It proved to be Nickelback\\'s most popular effort to date, remaining in the Billboard Top 30 for over two years and selling over seven million copies in the U.S. alone. It also spawned five Top 20 singles, a feat that attracted the attention of veteran producer (and demonstrated hitmaker) Mutt Lange. Nickelback traveled to Lange\\'s home in Switzerland to share songwriting ideas; impressed with the results, they also enlisted him to helm their next album. Recorded in a converted Vancouver barn, Dark Horse marked the band\\'s sixth studio album upon its release in November 2008. Nickelback\\'s seventh studio album arrived nearly three years after the multi-platinum-selling Dark Horse. The 11-track Here and Now, which was preceded by the singles \"Bottoms Up\" and \"When We Stand Together,\" hit the streets on November 21, 2011. The following year Kroeger began working on fellow Canadian rock star Avril Lavigne\\'s eponymous fifth album. Shortly after their working partnership began, they began dating and eventually married in early 2013. The band put together their first compilation, The Best of Nickelback, Vol. 1, which appeared in November of 2013; the 19-track collection contained no new songs. In 2014, the band\\'s contract with Roadrunner expired and they decided not to renew, signing instead with Universal Republic for their eighth album, No Fixed Address. The album included a number of departures from Nickelback\\'s usual fare, including the radio-friendly \"What Are You Waiting For?,\" the politicized \"Edge of a Revolution,\" and \"Got Me Runnin\\' \\'Round,\" which featured a horn section and rapper Flo Rida. No Fixed Address appeared in November 2014, debuting at four on Billboard\\'s Top 200 and generating rock radio hits in \"Edge of a Revolution\" and \"Million Miles an Hour.\" As they worked on their ninth album in 2016, Nickelback released a cover of Don Henley\\'s \"Dirty Laundry\" and negotiated a switch from Republic to BMG. Feed the Machine, their first record for BMG, was co-produced by Chris Baseford (Disturbed) and appeared in June 2017. The LP debuted at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, with its title track reaching 12 on Billboard\\'s Mainstream Rock chart. A non-LP cover of the Charlie Daniels Band\\'s \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" featuring guitarist Dave Martone appeared in 2020, as did a 15th anniversary edition of 2005\\'s multi-platinum-selling All the Right Reasons. Nickelback returned with new material in 2022\\'s \"San Quentin,\" the first taste of their tenth studio album, Get Rollin\\'. Another co-production with Chris Baseford, Get Rollin\\' focused on heavy riffs and good times, a combination highlighted on the breezy single \"High Time.\" ~ Andrew Leahey'\n",

      "'Alt-rock icons the Smashing Pumpkins are recognized for their amalgam of progressive rock, heavy metal, goth, psychedelia, and dream pop; a layered, powerful style driven by swirling, distorted guitars that churned beneath lead singer/songwriter Billy Corgan\\'s angst-ridden lyrics. One of the most visible bands of \\'90s, alongside grunge acts like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins achieved mainstream success over the decade with classic releases Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. After a foray into electronic rock on Adore, Corgan issued a final pair of efforts before putting the group to sleep for an extended early-2000s hiatus that ended with 2007\\'s Zeitgeist. Along with an ever-changing lineup, he continued to record under the Pumpkins moniker before reconvening most of the original lineup for a 2018 reunion tour and albums such as 2020\\'s synth-heavy Cyr and 2023\\'s Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts.The son of a jazz guitarist, William Patrick Corgan grew up in a Chicago suburb, leaving home at the age of 19 to move to Florida with his fledgling goth metal band, the Marked. After the band failed down South he returned to Chicago around 1988, where he began working at a used-record store. At the shop he met James Iha (guitar), a graphic arts student at Loyola University, and the two began collaborating, performing, and recording songs with a drum machine. Corgan met D\\'Arcy Wretzky at a club show; after arguing about the merits of the Dan Reed Network, the two became friends and she joined the group as a bassist. Soon, the bandmembers, who named themselves the Smashing Pumpkins, had gained a dedicated local following, which included the head of a local club who booked them to open for Jane\\'s Addiction. Before the pivotal concert, the band hired Jimmy Chamberlin, a former jazz musician, as their full-time drummer. In 1990, the Smashing Pumpkins released their debut single, \"I Am One,\" on the local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single quickly sold out, and in December the band released \"Tristessa\" on Sub Pop. By this point, the Smashing Pumpkins had become the subject of a hot bidding war, and the group latched onto a clever way to move to a major label without losing indie credibility. They signed to Virgin Records, yet it was decided that the group\\'s debut would be released on the Virgin subsidiary Caroline, and then the band would move to the majors. The strategy worked; Gish, a majestic mix of Black Sabbath and dream pop produced by Butch Vig, became a huge college and modern rock hit upon its spring 1991 release. The Pumpkins embarked on an extensive supporting tour for Gish, which lasted over a year and included opening slots for Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam. During the Gish tour, tensions between bandmembers began to escalate, as former couple Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to drugs and alcohol, and Corgan entered a heavy depression. These tensions weren\\'t resolved by the time the group entered the studio with Vig to record their second album. Toward the beginning of the sessions, the Pumpkins were given significant exposure through the inclusion of \"Drown\" on the Singles soundtrack in the summer of 1992. As the sessions progressed, Corgan relieved himself of his depression by working heavily -- not only did he write a surplus of songs, he played nearly all of the guitars and bass on each recording, which meant that its release was delayed several times. The resulting album, Siamese Dream, was an immaculate production and was embraced by critics upon its July 1993 release. It was their first blockbuster, debuting at number ten on the charts and establishing the Smashing Pumpkins as stars. \"Cherub Rock,\" the first single, was a modern rock hit, yet it was \"Today\" and the acoustic \"Disarm\" that sent the album into the stratosphere. The Smashing Pumpkins became the headliners of Lollapalooza 1994, and following the tour\\'s completion, the band went back into the studio to record a new album that Corgan had already claimed would be a double-disc set. To tide fans over until then, the Pumpkins released the B-sides and rarities album Pisces Iscariot in October 1994. Working with producers Flood and Alan Moulder, the Smashing Pumpkins recorded as a full band for their third album, the double-disc set Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which became an even bigger hit than Siamese Dream, debuting at number one on the charts. On the strength of the singles \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings,\" \"1979,\" \"Zero,\" and \"Tonight, Tonight,\" it sold over four million copies in the U.S., eventually being certified platinum over eight times. The Pumpkins had graduated to stadium shows for the Mellon Collie tour, and the band was at the peak of its popularity when things began to spiral. On July 12, prior to two shows at Madison Square Garden, the group\\'s touring keyboardist, Jonathan Melvoin, died from a heroin overdose; he was with Chamberlin, who survived his own overdose. In the wake of the tragedy, the remaining Pumpkins fired Chamberlin and spent two months on hiatus as they recovered and searched for a new drummer. Early in August, they announced that Filter member Matt Walker would be their touring drummer and Dennis Flemion, a member of the Frogs, would be their touring keyboardist for the remainder of the year. They returned to the stage at the end of August and spent the next five months on tour.In spring, the Smashing Pumpkins recorded two songs for the soundtracks for Batman &amp; Robin (the Grammy-winning \"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\") and Lost Highway (\"Eye\"). The latter track hinted at the direction of their next album, which took a surprise turn into subdued electronics. Shrouded by the death of Corgan\\'s mother and a divorce, Adore followed a few months later. Despite topping international charts and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200, the effort\\'s sales and reviews were disappointing, with many critics confused by their new direction. The band embarked on a tour, contributing 100-percent of the earnings to charity, and returned to the studio. Prior to the release of their fifth album, Chamberlin returned to the group and Wretzky made her exit, replaced by Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur. Bringing the band back to its early rock roots, MACHINA: The Machines of God landed in early 2000. Peaking at number three, MACHINA included the singles \"Stand Inside Your Love\" and \"The Everlasting Gaze.\" In the midst of album promotion, Corgan announced his intention to dissolve the band that year with a farewell tour. Fans received one last treat when Corgan and company finished tracks that were left over from the MACHINA sessions. Surprisingly, Virgin Records balked at the idea of releasing the 25-track set so close to the release of their previous album, so the band put the entire album (going by the official title of Machina II: The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music) on the Internet for fans to download for free. On December 2, 2000, the Pumpkins played a mammoth show at Chicago\\'s Metro (also the venue at which the group played its first show back in 1988). Booked as a final farewell, it would actually just be their first official hiatus, the start of an uneven period for Corgan when the Pumpkins would become known as much for lineup and status changes as the music itself.During the break, former members of the band didn\\'t wait long before carrying on with other projects. Corgan spent the summer of 2001 playing guitar with New Order on select concert dates, and later in the year unveiled his new band, Zwan, which included Chamberlin on drums (as well as former Chavez guitarist Matt Sweeney and bassist David \"Skullfisher\" Pajo). He also released a book of poetry. The other two former Pumpkins, Iha and Auf der Maur, began putting together an alt-rock supergroup dubbed the Virgins. Iha also began playing with A Perfect Circle. A pair of postmortem Pumpkins collections were also issued as a double-disc/DVD, both called Greatest Hits (aka Rotten Apples). Corgan released his first solo album, The Future Embrace, in 2005, and on the day it came out, he took out a full-page ad in The Chicago Tribune to announce that the Smashing Pumpkins were reuniting just five years after splitting. However, he hadn\\'t informed any of his past bandmates, and only Chamberlin joined for the ride. The resulting album, Zeitgeist (Reprise Records), was issued in 2007. Although it peaked at number two, the effort continued the band\\'s late-era decline in sales and critical acclaim. The new lineup -- which added guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton -- embarked on a successful international tour, despite lukewarm reception to Zeitgeist. Corgan and Chamberlin released an EP, American Gothic, at the start of 2008, before Corgan shook things up once again by announcing that the group would no longer record albums and would instead only issue singles. Chamberlin parted ways with the band once again in March 2009 and Corgan was joined by Schroeder, bassist Nicole Fiorentino, and drummer Mike Byrne. Once the dust settled, Corgan followed through on his promise to issue only short-form releases, putting out the track \"A Song for a Son\" in December of 2009. Scattered songs from the band\\'s Teargarden by Kaleidyscope concept were released over the next two years as free downloads, with physical collections of the tracks released in 2010 by way of the EP box sets Songs for a Sailor and The Solstice Bare.In 2012, Corgan decided to take a break from the single-centric concept and released Oceania, the Smashing Pumpkins\\' official eighth studio album. A live companion, Oceania: Live in NYC, was released the following year. In 2014, Corgan announced that he would be releasing two albums the following year under a new deal with BMG, which would tie up the Teargarden concept; these would be titled Monuments to an Elegy and Day for Night. By this point, Fiorentino and Byrne had left the band, and drums on Monuments to an Elegy were played by Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe. Monuments was released on December 9, 2014 and debuted in the Top 40 of the Billboard 200, making it their lowest-charting effort since their debut. Chamberlin returned to the band for a 2015 tour, although the promised Day for Night failed to materialize on schedule. In early 2016, Iha reunited with Corgan and Chamberlin for a performance in Los Angeles, their first show together in almost two decades. Subsequent live shows followed, leading to an eventual reunion of the original lineup (sans Wretzky) for a 2018 tour. The Shiny and Oh So Bright Tour featured the three founding members and bassist Jack Bates (son of Peter Hook). To coincide with the summertime trek, the Pumpkins released \"Solara,\" the first single from their reunion album Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1/LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun. Produced by Rick Rubin, Shiny and Oh So Bright appeared in November 2018. Iha and Chamberlin were also on board for the group\\'s 11th studio album, 2020\\'s Cyr. Produced by Corgan in Chicago, the double LP also featured contributions by longtime guitarist Schroeder and included the songs \"Cyr\" and \"The Colour of Love.\" Released in November of 2020, the album hit number ten on Billboard\\'s Top Rock Albums chart. It was also released in conjunction with a five-part animated sci-fi series, In Ashes. A single, \"Beguiled,\" arrived in September 2022 as the first track released off 2023\\'s Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts. Along with being the Pumpkins 12th studio album, Atum was the group\\'s third concept album, a spiritual sequel to both 1995\\'s Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness and 2000\\'s MACHINA:The Machines of God. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Neil Z.

Fans grew together with Dan Marsala, Ryan Philips, Josh Wills, and Adam Russell, from Page Avenue (2003), In the Wake of Determination (2005), The Black Swan (2008), The Constant (2010), Wolves (2017), to Tear Me to Pieces (2022). They specialize in intense, passionate, confessional compositions that inspire and empower. Songs like “The Antidote,” “Real Life,” “Miracle,” “The Ghost of You and I,” “Anthem of Our Dying Day,” and “Take Me Back” resonate with anyone determined to triumph over adversity. Until the day I die, indeed.\"\n",

      "'With alt-rock anthems heavy on melody and personality, Foo Fighters have grown from Dave Grohl\\'s humble solo project into one of the biggest -- and most enduring -- acts in modern rock. Once his self-recorded debut became a hit in 1995, the former Nirvana drummer turned Foo Fighters into a full-fledged band whose lineup coalesced after the 1997 release of The Colour and the Shape. With 1999\\'s There Is Nothing Left to Lose, the group\\'s sound gelled into a recognizable signature built upon the hooky loud-quiet-loud dynamics of Pixies and Nirvana, a modern rock sound anchored by Grohl\\'s love of classic guitar rock. Alone among their peers, Foo Fighters displayed a rigorous work ethic, recording and touring relentlessly into the 2020s, racking up hit albums, multiple Grammy wins and, eventually, a 2021 induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. All this activity allowed the Foos to experiment, whether it was on 2005\\'s double-album In Your Honor, the travelogue of 2014\\'s Sonic Highways, or the danceable, feel-good anthems on 2021\\'s Medicine at Midnight. The dedication to work also carried Foo Fighters through tragedy when their drummer Taylor Hawkins unexpectedly died in 2022. Grohl rallied the group to deliver But Here We Are, a cathartic tribute to their colleague, the following year. All of this industriousness stems from Dave Grohl, who had been playing guitar and writing songs long before he began drumming. Throughout his early teens he performed in a variety of hardcore punk bands and in the late \\'80s he joined the Washington, D.C.-area hardcore band Scream as their drummer. During Scream\\'s final days, Grohl began recording his own material in the basement studio of his friend Barrett Jones. Some of Grohl\\'s songs appeared on Scream\\'s final album, Fumble. After the band\\'s 1990 summer tour, Grohl joined Nirvana and moved cross-country to Seattle. After Nirvana recorded Nevermind, Grohl went back to the D.C. area and recorded a handful of tracks that would appear on Pocketwatch, a cassette released by Simple Machines. For most of 1992, he was busy with Nirvana, but when the band was off the road, he recorded solo material with Jones, who had also moved to Seattle. The pair kept recording throughout early 1993, when Grohl returned to Nirvana to record In Utero. He had toyed with the idea of releasing another independent cassette in the summer of 1993, but the plans never reached fruition. Following Kurt Cobain\\'s suicide in 1994, the drummer kept quiet for several months. In the fall of 1994, Grohl and Jones decamped to a professional studio, where in the space of a week, they recorded the songs that comprised Foo Fighters\\' debut album. Boiling down his backlog of songs to about 15 tracks, Grohl played all the instruments on the album. He made 100 copies of the tape, passing it out to friends and associates. In no time, Grohl\\'s solo project became the object of a fierce record company bidding war.Instead of embarking on a full-fledged solo career, Grohl decided to form a band. Through his wife he met Nate Mendel, the bassist for Sunny Day Real Estate. Shortly before the pair met, Jeremy Enigk, the leader of Sunny Day Real Estate, had converted to Christianity and quit the band, effectively ending the group\\'s career. Not only did Mendel join Grohl\\'s band, but so did Sunny Day\\'s drummer, William Goldsmith. Former Germs and Nirvana guitarist Pat Smear rounded out the lineup. The band, named Foo Fighters after a World War II secret force that allegedly researched UFOs, signed a contract with Capitol Records. The band\\'s self-titled debut, consisting solely of Dave Grohl\\'s solo recordings, was released in July of 1995. It became an instant success in America, as \"This Is a Call\" garnered heavy alternative and album rock airplay. By early 1996, the album was certified platinum in the U.S. Throughout 1996, Foo Fighters supported the album with an extensive tour, enjoying a crossover hit with \"Big Me.\" Late in the year, the group began recording its second album with producer Gil Norton. During the sessions, William Goldsmith left the band due to creative tensions, leaving Grohl to drum on the majority of the album. Before the record\\'s release, Goldsmith was replaced by Taylor Hawkins, who had previously drummed with Alanis Morissette. The Colour and the Shape, Foo Fighters\\' second album and the first they recorded as a band, was issued in May of 1997. Smear left the group in the wake of the album\\'s completion and was replaced by guitarist Franz Stahl, whose stay proved short-lived; 1999\\'s There Is Nothing Left to Lose was recorded as a three-piece, with ex-No Use for a Name guitarist Chris Shiflett signing on soon after. One by One, the group\\'s most polished production, appeared in late 2002, followed by 2005\\'s In Your Honor, which narrowly missed the top of Billboard\\'s album chart. After releasing a live album titled Skin and Bones in 2006, the band returned to Norton\\'s studio and started constructing a dozen fractured, eclectic rock songs to be released in 2007 under the name Echoes, Silence, Patience, and Grace. Two years later, the group released its first compilation, Greatest Hits, as Grohl launched his new supergroup Them Crooked Vultures, which also featured Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and Led Zeppelin\\'s John Paul Jones. Foo Fighters reconvened for 2011\\'s Wasting Light, a Butch Vig production that doubled as the official return of Pat Smear, who hadn\\'t played on any of the band\\'s albums since 1997. Wasting Light wound up as a smash success for the Foos, debuting at number one on the Billboard charts, going gold in the U.S. and garnering the band another four Grammy Awards. In the wake of Wasting Light, several other Foo projects emerged -- a limited-edition compilation of covers called Medium Rare released for Record Store Day 2011; a documentary of the band called Back and Forth -- and the group toured the album into 2012. In 2012, Foo Fighters announced they were taking a hiatus and Dave Grohl immediately returned to the confines of Queens of the Stone Age, drumming on their 2013 album, ...Like Clockwork. He also threw himself into directing a documentary about the legendary Los Angeles recording studio Sound City. The film appeared early in 2013 to positive reviews, and it was accompanied by a soundtrack called Sound City: Reel to Real, which featured Grohl-directed jams including a variety of Sound City veterans, plus Paul McCartney. Not long after its release, Foo Fighters announced that their hiatus had ended and they were working on a new album. Sonic Highways, released late in 2014, was their most ambitious project yet; each track was recorded in a different city, some with special featured guests, a process documented on an eight-episode documentary series for HBO. Sonic Highways saw international release in early November 2014. During the Sonic Highways world tour, the Foos had the honor of being the final band to perform on The Late Show with David Letterman on May 24, 2015. Soon after, as touring resumed, Grohl fell from the stage during a stop in Sweden, breaking his leg. He performed from a throne for the remainder of the tour, which was rechristened the \"Broken Leg Tour.\" In late 2015, both as a gesture of appreciation to fans and a tribute to the victims of the Paris terror attacks, Foo Fighters released the Saint Cecilia EP, a five-song blast that featured Gary Clark, Jr. and Ben Kweller. It returned the band to the Billboard charts, peaking in the Top 20 on the Hard Rock, Alternative, Tastemaker, and Vinyl charts. Soon after, the band announced an indefinite hiatus and would not release new music until two years later, when they returned with the single \"Run.\" This was the first taste of their ninth album, Concrete and Gold, which appeared in September 2017. Produced by Greg Kurstin, the album found Grohl incorporating some prog rock influences into the group\\'s sound. It also featured a handful of unexpected guest performers, including Paul McCartney, who played drums on a track, saxophonist Dave Koz, Boyz II Men\\'s Shawn Stockman, and the Kills\\' Alison Mosshart; the latter two both added backing vocals. Along with topping the rock charts, the album was also the group\\'s second to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Foo Fighters toured extensively throughout 2017 and 2018, including making an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. By 2019, they were back at work in the studio, recording in an historic house in Encino, California, and again working with producer Kurstin. Initially scheduled for release in 2020, Medicine at Midnight was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a lead single, \"Shame Shame,\" did appear in November 2020, topping the mainstream rock chart. Two more songs followed, \"No Son of Mine\" and \"Waiting on a War,\" paving the way for the album, which ultimately arrived in February 2021. In March 2022, the Foo Fighters traveled to South America to play a handful of concerts, headlining the Lollapalooza festival in Argentina on March 20. On the morning of March 25, 2022, drummer Taylor Hawkins was found dead in his hotel room in Bogotá, Colombia, where the group was scheduled to perform that evening; he was 50 years old. At the end of 2022, Foo Fighters announced they planned to continue as a band following the death of Hawkins. Grohl and his bandmates processed the loss of their colleague on But Here We Are, an album that occasionally echoed the spirit of the first Foo Fighters album while also featuring the assured, precise execution of Greg Kurstin, who returned for his third record with the Foos. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'After becoming a cult hero as the lead singer of the Misfits and Samhain, Glenn Danzig finally stepped into the mainstream with his group Danzig, who took the horror-themed lyrical imagery of his earlier groups into darker and more devilish directions while draping his rough but melodic tunes in heavy metal garb. Featuring former Samhain members John Christ (guitar) and Eerie Von (bass) along with powerhouse hardcore drummer Chuck Biscuits (formerly of Black Flag, D.O.A., and the Circle Jerks), Danzig was an ideal vehicle for the frontman\\'s booming, theatrical vocal style (Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and Jim Morrison were often cited as his key influences) and the gothic melodrama of his songwriting. Danzig\\'s first two albums -- 1988\\'s Danzig and 1990\\'s Danzig II: Lucifuge -- set the template for his new sound as he gained greater visibility, and for many, 1992\\'s Danzig III: How the Gods Kill would remain his definitive work. The 1993 EP Thrall: Demonsweatlive combined studio and live material, earning Danzig a major MTV hit with a live version of \"Mother,\" but 1994\\'s Danzig 4 was the final album featuring the original lineup. 1996\\'s Danzig 5: Blackacidevil found the frontman exploring industrial-influenced sounds and taking a larger role as an instrumentalist. Through the rest of the \\'90s and up to 2010, the Danzig lineup was a revolving door and their releases reflected a lack of stability, but with 2010\\'s Deth Red Sabaoth they took a more aggressive and more focused attack suggesting the Misfits and Samhain. Glenn paid homage to a number of his key influences on 2015\\'s Skeletons and 2020\\'s Danzig Sings Elvis.Glenn Danzig co-founded the Misfits in Lodi, New Jersey in 1977. They rose from obscurity to become one of the biggest bands in the hardcore underground before they broke up in 1984. Almost immediately after the Misfits called it quits, Danzig formed the metallic, brooding Samhain in order to experiment with different sounds, but that project imploded as well. The band Danzig was put together in 1987, and quickly inked a deal with Rick Rubin\\'s Def American label. Their self-titled debut found Danzig playing the Satanic metal singer role to the hilt, even if the band\\'s songs sounded much the same. Danzig II: Lucifuge followed in 1990, and it broadened the band\\'s musical palette, expanding on the simple blues riffs of the debut with more extensive forays into that style. Danzig III: How the Gods Kill marked a full-fledged entry into the realm of gothic romanticism, working to create moods rather than pounding heavy metal aggression. \"Dirty Black Summer\" and \"How the Gods Kill\" became staples on MTV\\'s Headbanger\\'s Ball. Danzig next released a solo project, Black Aria, a quasi-operatic attempt at classical instrumentals depicting the fall of Satan from heaven. The band broke through into the mainstream in 1993, when a live video for \"Mother,\" a song originally released on Danzig that appeared in a live version on the EP Thrall: Demonsweatlive, became an inescapable smash on MTV and even charted as a single, nearly cracking the Billboard Top 40. Meanwhile, Danzig contributed a song entitled \"Thirteen\" to Johnny Cash\\'s acclaimed 1994 effort American Recordings. The more experimental Danzig 4 was released in 1994 and entered the charts at number 29, but its quiet, moody, atmospheric subtlety didn\\'t find as much favor with the band\\'s new audience as the anthemic \"Mother,\" while some longtime fans dismissed it as too mellow, and therefore commercial. During the supporting tour, Chuck Biscuits left the band and was replaced by Joey Castillo. Following the tour, Danzig broke up the band and formed a new version featuring ex-Prong guitarist/vocalist Tommy Victor, drummer Castillo, and bassist Josh Lazie; this lineup released Danzig 5: Blackacidevil on Halloween 1996. Blackacidevil was ignored by both the press and the public, falling out of the charts after a mere three weeks. 6:66 Satan\\'s Child followed in 1999; Live on the Black Hand Side appeared two years later. In 2002 and 2004, respectively, Danzig released the stripped-down I Luciferi and Circle of Snakes, both returns to form that found the artist emulating the simplistic brutality of his 1988 debut. Black Aria II arrived in the fall of 2006. The band did a tour in 2008 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their debut before releasing their ninth album, Deth Red Sabaoth, in 2010. By this time Danzig has finally found a steady lineup, with Glenn joined by Tommy Victor on guitar, Steve Zing on bass, and Johnny Kelly on drums, though Glenn continued to contribute guitar, bass, and keyboards to their studio sessions. Skeletons, a ten-track collection of newly recorded covers that included Danzig-blasted renditions of Aerosmith\\'s \"Lord of the Thighs,\" the Everly Brothers\\' \"Crying in the Rain,\" and Davie Allan &amp; the Arrows\\' theme from the 1967 biker film \"Devils Angels,\" arrived in 2015. 2016 saw Danzig setting aside years of legal and personal squabbles with Misfits bassist Jerry Only -- who had been leading his own edition of the band since 1996 -- to play a pair of shows headlining that year\\'s Riot Fest festivals in Denver and Chicago under the banner the Original Misfits, joined by guitarist Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein, second guitarist Acey Slade, and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. The success of the Riot Fest dates led to a number of other Original Misfits shows (including a sold-out appearance at Madison Square Garden), while Glenn kept Danzig active, releasing the album Black Laden Crown in 2017. Long a serious Elvis fan, Glenn began recording covers of songs from the Presley catalog at his sessions, initially with an eye toward putting out a tribute EP. In time, the collection of Elvis tracks grew into a full-length album, and Danzig Sings Elvis was released in April 2020. ~ Steve Huey &amp; Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'Rooted in the campy theatrics of Alice Cooper and the sleazy hard rock of glam rockers the New York Dolls, Kiss became a favorite of American teenagers in the \\'70s. Most kids were infatuated with the look of Kiss, not their music. Decked out in outrageously flamboyant costumes and makeup, the band fashioned a captivating stage show featuring dry ice, smoke bombs, elaborate lighting, blood spitting, and fire breathing that captured the imaginations of thousands of kids. But Kiss\\' music shouldn\\'t be dismissed -- it is a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, earworm melodies, and sweeping strings. It\\'s a sound that laid the groundwork for both arena rock and the pop-metal that dominated rock in the late \\'80s. In 1983 the band went unmasked, resulting in the platinum-selling LP of the same name, but re-applied the makeup ten years later. Since then, the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Famers have remained a potent live draw and have sold over 75 million records worldwide, with highlights arriving via influential efforts like Alive!, Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, Love Gun, Dynasty, and Lick It Up. Kiss was the brainchild of Gene Simmons (bass, vocals) and Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar, vocals), former members of the New York-based hard rock band Wicked Lester; the duo brought in drummer Peter Criss through his ad in Rolling Stone, while guitarist Ace Frehley responded to an advertisement in The Village Voice. Even at their first Manhattan concert in 1973, the group\\'s approach was theatrical, and Flipside producer Bill Aucoin offered the band a management deal after the show. Two weeks later, they were signed to Neil Bogart\\'s fledgling record label, Casablanca. Kiss released their self-titled debut in February of 1974; it peaked at number 87 on the U.S. charts. By April of 1975, the group had released three albums and had been touring America constantly, building up a sizable fan base.Culled from those numerous concerts, Alive! (released in the fall of 1975) made the band rock &amp; roll superstars; it climbed into the Top Ten and its accompanying single, \"Rock \\'N\\' Roll All Nite,\" made it to number 12. Their follow-up, Destroyer, was released in March of 1976 and became the group\\'s first platinum album; it also featured their first Top Ten single, Peter Criss\\' power ballad \"Beth.\" Kiss mania was in full swing; thousands of pieces of merchandise hit the marketplace (including pinball machines, makeup and masks, and board games), and the group had two comic books released by Marvel as well as a live-action TV movie, Kiss Meet the Phantom of the Park. A 1977 Gallup poll named Kiss the most popular band in America. They were never seen in public without their makeup, and their popularity was growing by leaps and bounds; the membership of the Kiss Army, the band\\'s fan club, was in the six figures.Even such enormous popularity had its limits, though, and the band reached them in 1978, when all four members released solo albums on the same day in October. Simmons\\' record was the most successful, reaching number 22 on the charts, yet all of them made it into the Top 50. Dynasty, released in 1979, continued their streak of platinum albums, yet it was their last record with the original lineup -- Criss left in 1980. Kiss Unmasked, released in the summer of 1980, was recorded with session drummer Anton Fig; Criss\\' true replacement, Eric Carr, joined the band in time for their 1980 world tour. Kiss Unmasked was their first record since Destroyer to fail to go platinum, and 1981\\'s Music from the Elder, their first album recorded with Carr, didn\\'t even go gold -- it couldn\\'t climb past number 75 on the charts. Ace Frehley left the band after its release; he was replaced by Vinnie Vincent in 1982. Vincent\\'s first album with the group, 1982\\'s Creatures of the Night, fared better than Music from the Elder, yet it couldn\\'t make it past number 45 on the charts.Sensing it was time for a change, Kiss dispensed with their makeup for 1983\\'s Lick It Up. The publicity worked, as the album became their first platinum record in four years. Animalize, released the following year, was just as successful, and the group essentially recaptured their niche. Vincent left after Animalize and was replaced by Mark St. John, although St. John was soon taken ill with Reiter\\'s Syndrome and left the band. Bruce Kulick became Kiss\\' new lead guitarist in 1984. For the rest of the decade, Kiss turned out a series of best-selling albums, culminating in the early 1990 hit ballad \"Forever,\" which was their biggest single since \"Beth.\" Kiss was scheduled to record a new album with their old producer, Bob Ezrin, in 1990 when Eric Carr became severely ill with cancer; he died in November of 1991 at the age of 41. Kiss replaced him with Eric Singer and recorded Revenge (1992), their first album since 1989; it was a Top Ten hit and went gold. Kiss followed it with the release of Alive III the following year; it performed respectably but wasn\\'t up to the standards of their two previous live records.In 1996, the original lineup of Kiss -- featuring Simmons, Stanley, Frehley, and Criss -- reunited to perform an international tour, complete with their notorious makeup and special effects. The tour was one of the most successful of 1996, and in 1998 the reunited group issued Psycho Circus. While the ensuing tour in support of Psycho Circus was a success, sales of Kiss\\' reunion album weren\\'t as stellar as anticipated. Reminiscent of the band\\'s unfocused late-\\'70s period, few tracks on Psycho Circus featured all four members playing together (most tracks were supplemented with session musicians), as the band seemed more interested in flooding the marketplace with merchandise yet again instead of making the music their top priority. With rumors running rampant that the Psycho Circus Tour would be their last, the quartet announced in the spring of 2000 that they would be launching a U.S. farewell tour in the summer, which became one of the year\\'s top concert draws. But on the eve of a Japanese and Australian tour in early 2001, Peter Criss suddenly left the band once again, supposedly discontent with his salary. Taking his place was previous Kiss drummer Eric Singer, who in a controversial move for some longtime fans, donned Criss\\' cat-man makeup (since Simmons and Stanley own both Frehley and Criss\\' makeup designs, there was no threat of a lawsuit) as the farewell tour continued.With the band scheduled to call it a day (supposedly) by late 2001, a mammoth career-encompassing box set was set for release later in the year, while the summer saw perhaps the most over-the-top piece of Kiss merchandise yet: the \"Kiss Kasket,\" a real coffin fans could buy for $4,000. The group was relatively quiet throughout the rest of the year, but 2002 started with a bang as Gene Simmons turned in an entertaining and controversial interview on NPR where he criticized the organization and berated host Terry Gross with sexual comments and condescending answers. He was promoting his autobiography at the time, which also caused dissent in the Kiss camp because of inflammatory remarks made about Ace Frehley. Frehley subsequently declined to appear at an American Bandstand anniversary show; his place was taken by a wig-wearing Tommy Thayer, and Simmons was quick to dismiss the performance as another in a long series of money-oriented decisions. The band kept touring the globe with no new album in stores, but in 2008 they returned to the studio, re-recorded their hits, and released Jigoku-Retsuden aka KISSology or Kiss Klassics (the release was initially exclusive to Japan).In spring of 2009, the band began recording their first studio album in 11 years and released Sonic Boom in October. Produced by Paul Stanley and Greg Collins, the album was exclusively distributed in North America by Wal-Mart. In 2012, the band\\'s 20th studio album, Monster, surfaced, rewriting the cowbell-heavy party rock of their \\'70s heyday and adding some nods to the sinister metal of 1992\\'s Revenge. In 2014, after 15 years of eligibility, Kiss was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. The following year they released a collaborative single with the Japanese idol group Momoiro Clover Z. In 2017, a career-spanning single-disc best-of, Kissworld, was released to coincide with a massive world tour of the same name. The tour, which the band announced would be their final jaunt, was eventually renamed the \"End of the Road\" tour, and in true Kiss fashion, it was still going strong in 2021. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Red Voodoo is breaking out on the scene with their electric stage presence, polished harmonies, and a classic but yet fresh new take on Rock ‘n' Roll. Based out of Sacramento, CA the group has been playing small bars and clubs since 2019. A year later they released the two singles “Rise Up” and “Bring It Back” during the pandemic that effected the whole world. That led them to be openers for heavy hitters in rock such as rock n roll hall of famer Sammy Hagar, Bay Area legends Y&amp;T, Everclear, Slaughter, and many more. Last February, the group performed on the legendary Monsters Of Rock Cruise alongside Alice Cooper and Buckcherry to name a few. Red Voodoo is the youngest band to have played the festival on water to date. Directly following their shows at the world famous Cabo Wabo Cantina, where they played the nights between Sammy Hagar for his Birthday Bash, Red Voodoo hit the studio; the historic Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco. That is where the group would record their 5 track EP with grammy nominated producer Jaimeson Durr. The bands goal is to make Rock mainstream again and spark a fire in the hearts of music lovers around the globe.

      "'The brainchild of former Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, Rainbow quickly developed into one of the \\'70s most successful heavy metal bands behind charismatic frontman Ronnie James Dio. Together, the duo would produce a string of acclaimed albums which are still considered classics of the genre. But the group would change their musical approach numerous times following the singer\\'s departure, eventually confusing and alienating much of their audience. Releasing eight albums during its decade-long run, the band finally came to an end when Blackmore departed to rejoin his old Deep Purple comrades in a full-fledged reunion in 1984. And while the impact of Rainbow\\'s influence has faded with the intervening decades, theirs was a crucial chapter in the development of heavy metal and hard rock. Disillusioned and fed up with the chaotic state of Deep Purple in the mid-\\'70s, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore made the stunning announcement in May of 1975 that he was quitting the group he had founded and led for over seven years in order to start from scratch. Teaming up with up-and-coming American vocalist Ronnie James Dio, Blackmore built Rainbow around the singer\\'s former band Elf, minus their guitarist David Feinstein. Featuring bassist Craig Gruber, keyboard player Mickey Lee Soule, and drummer Gary Driscoll, the group\\'s 1975 debut Ritchie Blackmore\\'s Rainbow was quickly embraced by European fans and yielded their first hit single, \"Man on the Silver Mountain.\" Blackmore and Dio were dissatisfied with the album\\'s sound, however, and decided to revamp Rainbow (by then sufficiently established to do without Blackmore\\'s name) by drafting bassist Jimmy Bain, keyboard player Tony Carey, and former Jeff Beck Group drummer Cozy Powell. It was with this lineup that they entered Musicland studios in February 1976 to record the landmark Rising opus -- once voted the greatest heavy metal album of all time in a 1981 Kerrang! magazine readers\\' poll. Capturing Blackmore and Dio at the peak of their creative powers, Rising chronicled both the guitarist\\'s neo-classical metal compositions at their most ambitious, and the singer\\'s growing fixation with fantasy lyrical themes -- a blueprint he would adopt for the rest of his career. Following its release, the band embarked upon a successful world tour, culminating in a sold-out European jaunt which spawned a best-selling live album entitled On Stage, released in 1977. By the time they returned with the equally acclaimed Long Live Rock \\'n\\' Roll album in 1978 (featuring bassist Bob Daisley and keyboard player David Stone), Rainbow had established themselves as one of Europe\\'s best-selling groups and top concert draws. But the volatile relationship between Blackmore and Dio further deteriorated as the American-born singer became increasingly frustrated standing in the guitarist\\'s shadow -- even in his own country, where the group was now fully committed to breaking big. To make matters worse, Blackmore had been so impressed with \"Long Live Rock \\'n\\' Roll\"\\'s success as a single that he began to consider altering the band\\'s sound in order to pursue a more mainstream hard rock approach (a direction which Dio wanted no part of). A chance meeting with Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath (only recently divorced for good from unreliable frontman Ozzy Osbourne) helped the singer make up his mind, and Dio officially quit Rainbow in early 1979 to join the Sabs.Finding a suitable replacement for the charismatic singer proved a serious dilemma, and when Blackmore eventually recruited former Marbles vocalist Graham Bonnett, his decision came with an all-around retooling of Rainbow\\'s sound, not to mention, once again, the band\\'s membership, which now included former Deep Purple cohort Roger Glover and keyboard player Don Airey. With the release of 1979\\'s Down to Earth, gone were the mystical themes and epic metal compositions, replaced by a more streamlined commercial hard rock style. But despite containing two of Rainbow\\'s biggest singles, \"All Night Long\" and \"Since You\\'ve Been Gone\" (the second was written by former Argent singer Russ Ballard), the album sputtered in stores, selling far fewer copies than the group\\'s previous Dio-fronted efforts. Bonnett also failed to meet Blackmore\\'s lofty expectations on-stage, and after a single, disastrously drunken performance at the inaugural Castle Donington Monsters of Rock Festival in the summer of 1980, the singer was unceremoniously given the boot. Once again strapped for a vocalist, Blackmore found his man in American singer Joe Lynn Turner, who along with new drummer Bobby Rondinelli signaled a true career rebirth for Rainbow. Wishing to shed the group\\'s overblown, Dio-associated Euro-metal sound of days past once and for all, the new Rainbow lineup was made to order for another bid at widespread acceptance in America. The first product of this new direction, 1981\\'s well-received Difficult to Cure helped the group regain some of their momentum and yielded their highest-charting single ever, another Russ Ballard-penned track entitled \"I Surrender.\" In fact, the record\\'s title track -- a sprawling, ten-minute metallic blitzkrieg through Beethoven\\'s Symphony No. 9 -- was the only throwback to Rainbow\\'s highbrow metal origins. Released in 1982, Straight Between the Eyes failed to chart any successful singles, however, and the band\\'s appeal began to nose-dive, along with Blackmore\\'s increasingly uninventive, risk-free songwriting. 1983\\'s Bent Out of Shape (featuring new members in keyboard player David Rosenthal and drummer Chuck Burgi) fared no better, and after accepting the fact that Rainbow\\'s best days were behind them, Blackmore finally relented and took part in the long-rumored and hoped for re-formation of Deep Purple\\'s classic Mark II lineup. Typically, the guitarist refused to go quietly, and Rainbow were backed by a full symphony orchestra for their final March 1984 performance in Japan. A posthumous live release, entitled Finyl Vinyl, was compiled in 1986, and though he would briefly resurrect the Ritchie Blackmore\\'s Rainbow moniker after quitting Purple for the second time in 1994 (even recording an album called Stranger in Us All), this incarnation would be short-lived. Blackmore was later heard performing with his purported fiance Candice Night in the medieval folk duo Blackmore\\'s Night. Following a prolonged break, Blackmore announced in 2015 that he planned to play a series of concerts under the moniker of Ritchie Blackmore\\'s Rainbow. The band played a number of shows, which included headlining the famous Monsters of Rock Festival in Germany. Despite previously saying they wouldn\\'t be releasing new music, Blackmore later admitted they\\'d written new material, but rather than a full album, it would likely just be released as singles. The band announced a U.K. tour in 2017, and released Live in Birmingham 2016 that same year. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'Queen epitomized all the glittery excess of album-oriented rock in the 1970s, marrying the crunch of heavy metal to the pomp of prog rock then leavening the heady mixture with camp humor. It was an eccentric blend that proved surprisingly versatile, allowing for the mock-operatic \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" soaring arena rock like \"Somebody to Love,\" thumping rockers like \"Fat Bottomed Girls,\" the neo-rockabilly \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\" and the disco excursion \"Another One Bites the Dust.\" Queen\\'s range proved that they were a deceptively egalitarian band: they\\'re the only classic rock group where each member wrote at least one of the group\\'s signature songs. Despite this division of labor, frontman Freddie Mercury commanded attention both during his life and after his death. A powerful singer with a penchant for drama, Mercury possessed an exaggerated charisma and a devilish sense of humor, qualities that made him one of the great rock stars of his generation. Queen\\'s reign began in earnest with 1975\\'s A Night at the Opera and lasted through The Game in 1980, a half-decade filled with big hits that turned into enduring standards. Although the hits weren\\'t as big in the \\'80s, the group retained its international popularity through Mercury\\'s death in 1991. After his passing, Queen\\'s original LPs found a new audience, partially cultivated by surviving members Brian May and Roger Taylor tending to archival releases and staying on the road, either with Paul Rodgers or Adam Lambert as Mercury\\'s replacement. Queen\\'s legacy also was assisted by the 2018 release of Bohemian Rhapsody, a biopic of the band featuring Rami Malek in an Oscar-winning turn as Freddie Mercury. The origins of Queen lay in the hard rock psychedelic group Smile, which guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor joined in 1967. Following the departure of Smile\\'s lead vocalist, Tim Staffell, in 1971, May and Taylor formed a group with Freddie Mercury, the former lead singer for Wreckage. Within a few months, bassist John Deacon joined them, and they began rehearsing. Over the next two years, as all four members completed college, they simply rehearsed, playing just a handful of gigs. By 1973, they had begun to concentrate on their career, releasing their debut album, Queen, that year and setting out on their first tour. Produced by the band, along with Roy Thomas Baker and John Anthony, Queen was more or less a straight metal album and drew favorable comparisons to Led Zeppelin. However, it was with their sophomore album, Queen II, that the band unexpectedly broke through in Britain in early 1974. Before its release, the band played Top of the Pops, performing \"Seven Seas of Rhye.\" Both the song and the performance were smash successes, and the single rocketed into the Top Ten, setting the stage for Queen II to reach number five. Following its release, the group embarked on its first American tour, supporting Mott the Hoople. On the strength of their campily dramatic performances, the album climbed to number 43 in the States. Queen released their third album, Sheer Heart Attack, before the end of 1974. The music hall-meets-Zeppelin \"Killer Queen\" climbed to number two on the U.K. charts, taking the album to number two as well. Sheer Heart Attack made some inroads in America, setting the stage for the breakthrough of 1975\\'s A Night at the Opera. Queen labored long and hard over the record; according to many reports, it was the most expensive rock record ever made at the time of its release. The first single, \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" became Queen\\'s signature song, and with its bombastic, mock-operatic structure punctuated by heavy metal riffing, encapsulated their ambitious, genre-bending musical vision. To support \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" Queen shot one of the first conceptual music videos, and the gamble paid off as the single spent nine weeks at number one in England, breaking the record for the longest run at number one. The song and A Night at the Opera were equally successful in America, as the album climbed into the Top Ten and quickly went platinum. Following A Night at the Opera, Queen were established as superstars, yet they continued to work at a rapid rate. In the summer of 1976, they performed a free concert at London\\'s Hyde Park that broke attendance records, and they released the hit single \"Somebody to Love\" a few months later. It was followed by A Day at the Races, which was essentially a scaled-down version of A Night at the Opera that reached number one in the U.K. and number five in the U.S. They continued to pile up hit singles in both Britain and America over the next five years, as each of their albums went into the Top Ten, always going gold and usually platinum in the process. Featuring the Top Five double-A-sided single \"We Are the Champions\"/\"We Will Rock You,\" News of the World became a Top Ten hit in 1977. The following year, Jazz nearly replicated that success, with the single \"Fat Bottomed Girls\"/\"Bicycle Race\" becoming an international hit.Queen were at the height of their popularity as they entered the \\'80s, releasing The Game, their most diverse album to date, in 1980. On the strength of two number one singles -- the rockabilly-inspired \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" and the disco-fied \"Another One Bites the Dust\" -- The Game became the group\\'s first American number one album. Their largely instrumental soundtrack to Flash Gordon arrived later that same year. With the help of David Bowie, Queen were able to successfully compete with new wave with the 1981 hit single \"Under Pressure\" -- their first U.K. number one since \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" -- which was included both on 1981\\'s Greatest Hits and 1982\\'s Hot Space. Hot Space proved a moderate hit and paved the way for the more rock-oriented The Works, which arrived in 1984. Also a minor hit, it was buoyed the singles \"Radio Ga Ga,\" \"Hammer to Fall,\" and \"I Want to Break Free.\" Shortly afterward, Queen left Elektra and signed with Capitol. During this period, Queen began touring foreign markets, cultivating a large, dedicated fan base in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. In 1985, they returned to renewed popularity in Britain in the wake of their show-stopping performance at Live Aid. The following year, they released A Kind of Magic to strong European sales. It debuted at number one in the U.K. and remained there for over 60 weeks, spawning the singles \"A Kind of Magic,\" \"One Vision,\" \"Friends Will Be Friends,\" and \"Who Wants to Live Forever.\" The Miracle followed in 1989 and proved similarly successful, debuting at number one in the U.K. and cracking the Top 30 of the Billboard 200. The group\\'s 14th studio album, 1991\\'s Innuendo, was greeted even more favorably, going gold and peaking at number 30 in the U.S. It was a far bigger success in Europe, entering the U.K. charts at number one. However, by 1991, Queen had drastically scaled back their activity, causing rumors to circulate about Freddie Mercury\\'s health. On November 23, the singer issued a statement confirming that he had AIDS. Mercury died the next day from bronchial pneumonia resulting from his illness. The following spring, the remaining members of Queen held a memorial concert at Wembley Stadium that was broadcast to an international audience of more than one billion. Featuring such guest artists as David Bowie, Elton John, Annie Lennox, Def Leppard, and Guns N\\' Roses, the concert raised millions for the Mercury Phoenix Trust, which was established for AIDS awareness. The concert coincided with a revival of interest in \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which climbed to number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K. in the wake of its appearance in the Mike Myers comedy Wayne\\'s World. Following Mercury\\'s death, the remaining members of Queen were fairly quiet. Brian May released his second solo album, Back to the Light, in 1993, ten years after the release of his first record. Roger Taylor cut a few albums with the Cross, which he had been playing with since 1987, while Deacon essentially retired. The three reunited in 1994 to record backing tapes for vocal tracks Mercury recorded on his deathbed. The resulting album, Made in Heaven, was released in 1995 to strong sales, particularly in Europe. Crown Jewels, a box set repackaging their first eight LPs, followed in 1998. Archival live recordings, DVDs, and compilations continued to appear into the new millennium. The Queen name was revived in 2005, but this time with \"+ Paul Rodgers\" appended to it. Rodgers, the former lead singer of Free and Bad Company, joined Brian May and Roger Taylor (John Deacon remained retired) for several live shows, one of which was documented on 2005\\'s Return of the Champions, a double-disc release issued by the Hollywood label. International touring continued, as did a new studio album featuring Rodgers\\' vocals. Released under the \"Queen + Paul Rodgers\" tag, The Cosmos Rocks appeared in September 2008, followed by an American release one month later. Reception was decidedly mixed. Rodgers departed Queen in 2009 and in his wake came a new compilation called Absolute Greatest. TV appearances followed over the next two years, including a spot on the 2009 American Idol finale where they performed with Adam Lambert, and in 2010 Queen wound up leaving their home of EMI for Island, which brought all of the group\\'s recordings to Universal Records. A new round of reissues followed in 2011, along with a performance with Lambert at the MTV Europe Music Awards, and the vocalist soon became a fixture with the band, as Queen performed several big concerts and television performances in 2012 and 2013, followed by a full tour in 2014. Also that year, Queen released another compilation, Queen Forever, which was anchored by reworked versions of three old songs, including a solo number by Mercury where he duetted with Michael Jackson. The archival live album, A Night at the Odeon, featuring the band\\'s 1975 Christmas Eve performance at London\\'s Hammersmith Odeon, appeared in 2015. Over the next two years, the band stayed active, appearing live with Lambert. In 2018, Queen was the subject of the biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, which starred Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury. The band contributed to the soundtrack, which featured classic tracks as well as live recordings and several songs reworked for the film. Bohemian Rhapsody became an international hit and took home four Academy Awards, including Malek\\'s award for Best Actor.A concert collection featuring Lambert, Live Around the World, arrived in October 2020 but the next major Queen project was an elaborate Collector\\'s Edition reissue of The Miracle. The 1989 album was expanded into a five-CD set containing additional Blu-Rays, DVDs and LPs, all featuring previously unheard material, such as the Mercury-sung \"Face It Alone,\" which was released as a single prior to the box\\'s October 2022 release. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

They were not the first band to draw upon the heavy, sludgy sounds of the \\'70s; the group picked up a thread left hanging by fellow Seattle rockers Green River, grunge pioneers who favored the scuzzy rock of the Stooges, and they shared Jane\\'s Addiction\\'s love of grandiose heavy rock. Nevertheless, Soundgarden popularized metal within alternative rock, even obliterated the line separating the two subcultures. Melding the slow grind of Black Sabbath and cinematic scope of Led Zeppelin with the D.I.Y. aesthetics of punk, Soundgarden played with an intelligence and ironic sense of humor that was indebted to the American underground of the mid-\\'80s. Their music contained a similar sense of adventure, often taking detours into psychedelia, unconventional guitar tunings, and complicated time signatures. Vocalist Chris Cornell and guitarist Kim Thayil were excellent foils, with Cornell\\'s powerful wail pushing against Thayil\\'s winding riffs, a chemistry that gave the band a distinctive character that belonged neither to the mainstream nor the underground. This chemistry was evident from the band\\'s start, when Soundgarden was one of the first groups to release a recording on Seattle\\'s pioneering Sub Pop label. Those early records built a considerable buzz, suggesting Soundgarden would be the band that broke down the commercial doors for alternative rock. That didn\\'t turn out to be the case. They were eclipsed by the meteoric success of Nirvana, fellow Sub Pop alumni whose Nevermind became a blockbuster while Soundgarden was working on Badmotorfinger in the fall of 1991. As it turns out, Soundgarden received a boost from grunge exploding in the mainstream. Superunknown, their 1994 album, became an international smash, with its hit single \"Black Hole Sun\" becoming a standard of its era. The group didn\\'t weather success well, disbanding after 1996\\'s Down on the Upside, but their catalog endured, leading the band to reunite in 2010. Over the next few years, the group toured regularly, releasing a new album called King Animal in 2012, before Cornell died tragically in 2017. For a band so heavily identified with the Seattle scene, it\\'s ironic that two of its founding members were from the Midwest. Kim Thayil (guitar), Hiro Yamamoto (bass), and Bruce Pavitt were all friends in Illinois who decided to head to Olympia, Washington, to attend college in 1981. Though none of them completed college, all of them became involved in the Washington underground music scene. Pavitt was the only one who didn\\'t play -- he founded a fanzine that later became the Sub Pop record label. Yamamoto played in several cover bands before forming a band in 1984 with his roommate Chris Cornell (vocals), a Seattle native who had previously played drums in several bands. Thayil soon joined the duo and the group named itself Soundgarden after a local Seattle sculpture. Scott Sundquist was originally the band\\'s drummer, but he was replaced by Matt Cameron in 1986. Over the next two years, Soundgarden gradually built up a devoted cult following through their club performances.Pavitt signed Soundgarden to his fledgling Sub Pop label in the summer of 1987, releasing the single \"Hunted Down\" before the EP Screaming Life appeared later in the year. Screaming Life and the group\\'s second EP, 1988\\'s FOPP, became underground hits and earned the attention of several major labels. The band decided to sign to SST instead of a major, releasing Ultramega OK by the end of 1988. Ultramega OK received strong reviews among alternative and metal publications, and the group decided to make the leap to a major for its next album, 1989\\'s Louder Than Love. Released on A&amp;M Records, Louder Than Love became a word-of-mouth hit, earning positive reviews from mainstream publications, peaking at 108 on the charts, and earning a Grammy nomination. Following the album\\'s fall 1989 release, Yamamoto left the band to return to school. Jason Everman, a former guitarist for Nirvana, briefly played with the band before Ben Shepherd joined in early 1990.Soundgarden\\'s third album, 1991\\'s Badmotorfinger, was heavily anticipated by many industry observers as a potential breakout hit. Though it was a significant hit, reaching number 39 on the album charts, its success was overshadowed by the surprise success of Nirvana\\'s Nevermind, which was released the same month as Badmotorfinger. Prior to Nevermind, Soundgarden had been marketed by A&amp;M as a metal band, and the group had agreed to support Guns N\\' Roses on the fall 1991 Use Your Illusion tour. While the tour did help sales, Soundgarden benefited primarily from the grunge explosion, whose media attention helped turn the band into stars. They were also helped by the Top Ten success of Temple of the Dog, a tribute to deceased Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood that Cornell and Cameron recorded with members of Pearl Jam. By the spring release of 1994\\'s Superunknown, Soundgarden\\'s following had grown considerably, which meant that the album debuted at number one upon its release. (A year before its release, Shepherd and Cameron released an eponymous album by their side project, Hater.) Superunknown became one of the most popular records of 1994, generating a genuine crossover hit with \"Black Hole Sun,\" selling over three million copies and earning two Grammys. Soundgarden returned in 1996 with Down on the Upside, which entered the charts at number two. Despite the record\\'s strong initial sales, it failed to generate a big hit, and was hurt by grunge\\'s fading popularity. Soundgarden retained a sizable audience -- the album did go platinum, and they were co-headliners on the sixth Lollapalooza -- but they didn\\'t replicate the blockbuster success of Superunknown. After completing an American tour following Lollapalooza that was plagued by rumors of internal fighting, Soundgarden announced that they were breaking up in April 1997 to pursue other interests.During the late \\'90s and 2000s, each member kept very busy. Cornell released three solo albums, also recording and touring as Audioslave with former members of Rage Against the Machine. Cameron toured his Wellwater Conspiracy project, and played and recorded with Smashing Pumpkins and Pearl Jam. Thayil collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Cameron, Dave Grohl, Steve Fisk, and Boris. Meanwhile, Shepherd helped out with Wellwater Conspiracy, and also played and recorded with Mark Lanegan of Screaming Trees. Finally, in 2010, the band announced a reunion with a few live shows during the summer (including that year\\'s edition of Lollapalooza) which preceded a compilation, Telephantasm, in the fall. Telephantasm was initially available as a double-disc set on September 28, with a single-disc version appearing a week later (the single-disc was also included in Guitar Hero on September 28). In 2011, Soundgarden released their first live album, Live on I-5, which featured material recorded during the band\\'s supporting tour for Down on the Upside. All of this activity would be the prelude to Soundgarden\\'s full-on return in 2012, when they released their sixth album, King Animal, in the fall of that year. King Animal debuted at five on the Billboard Top 200 upon its November 2012 release and the band supported it throughout the next year with a tour. Matt Cameron took a hiatus from the band in November 2013 due to commitments with Pearl Jam; former Pearl Jam drummer Matt Chamberlain replaced him for live dates in 2014. That year, Soundgarden celebrated the 25th anniversary of Superunknown with the release of two deluxe editions of the 1991 album: a double-disc set and a seven-disc Super Deluxe box set. During 2015, Chris Cornell mentioned that Soundgarden had started working on material for a new studio set and the band made it official in 2016, announcing that they were beginning to record an album. In the meantime, the band released a deluxe reissue of Ultramega OK in March 2017 and began an American tour that April. On May 17, following the band\\'s concert at Detroit\\'s Fox Theater, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room; he had taken his own life at the age of 52. In the wake of Cornell\\'s death, the surviving members of Soundgarden took time to regroup. In an October 2018 interview, Thayil suggested that the remaining trio would retire the Soundgarden name but perhaps work together in some capacity. The three did perform at a Chris Cornell tribute concert in January 2019, a show where vocals were handled by several singers, including Brandi Carlile, Taylor Momsen, and Taylor Hawkins. In July 2019, the band released their first posthumous record, the double album Live from the Artists Den, which captured a concert from 2013. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'With their 1978 eponymous debut, Van Halen simultaneously rewrote the rules of rock guitar and hard rock in general. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen redefined what the electric guitar could do, developing a blindingly fast technique with a variety of self-taught two-handed tapping, hammer-ons, pull-offs, and effects that mimicked the sounds of machines and animals. It was wildly inventive and over the top, equaled only by vocalist David Lee Roth, who brought the role of a metal singer to near-performance art standards. Roth wasn\\'t blessed with great technique, unlike Eddie, but he had a flair for showmanship derived as much from lounge performers as Robert Plant. Together, they made Van Halen into the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the late \\'70s and early \\'80s, and in the process set the template for hard rock and heavy metal for the \\'80s. Throughout the \\'80s, it was impossible not to hear Van Halen\\'s instrumental technique on records that ranged from the heaviest metal to soft pop. Furthermore, Roth\\'s irony-drenched antics were copied by singers who took everything literally. One of these was Sammy Hagar, an arena rock veteran from the \\'70s who replaced Roth after the vocalist had a falling out with Van Halen in 1985. Hagar stayed with the band longer than Roth, helping the group remain a fixture on the top of the charts through the late \\'80s and early \\'90s. Halfway through the \\'90s the group\\'s sales began to slide, just as tensions between Hagar and Eddie began to arise. As the group prepped a greatest-hits album, Hagar was fired (or quit) and Roth was brought back on to sing two cuts on the compilation. He was subsequently replaced by Gary Cherone, a former member of Extreme, who lasted through one album before departing. After a half-decade hiatus, the band mounted a reunion tour with Hagar, who left in 2005 only to be replaced by Roth, with this reunion leading to a new album called A Different Kind of Truth in 2011. Through all the upheaval over lead vocalists, Eddie Van Halen and his prodigious talent remained the core of Van Halen. The son of a Dutch bandleader, Eddie and his family moved from the Netherlands to Pasadena, California in 1962, when he was seven years old and his older brother, Alex, was nine. As their father supported the family by playing in wedding bands, Eddie and Alex continued their classical piano training. Soon, both boys were enraptured by rock &amp; roll. Eddie learned how to play drums and Alex took up the guitar, eventually switching instruments. The brothers began a hard rock band called Mammoth and began playing around Pasadena, eventually meeting David Lee Roth. At the time, Roth, who had been raised in a wealthy Californian family, was singing in Redball Jet. Impressed by the Van Halen brothers, he joined forces with the group. Shortly afterward, bassist Michael Anthony, who was singing with Snake, became a member of Mammoth. After discovering that another band had the rights to the name Mammoth, the group decided to call themselves Van Halen in 1974, rejecting the proposed Rat Salade. For the next three years, Van Halen played throughout Pasadena, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles, in both clubs and hotel bars. Their repertoire covered everything from pop and rock to disco, but they eventually worked in their own original material. Within a few years, they had become the most popular local band in Los Angeles, and Eddie became well known for his groundbreaking technique. In 1977, Kiss\\' Gene Simmons financed a demo recording session for Van Halen after seeing them at the Starwood Club. On the strength of Simmons\\' recommendation, Mo Ostin and Ted Templeman signed Van Halen to Warner Bros., releasing the band\\'s debut the following year. Van Halen became a hit due to strong word of mouth, constant touring, and support from AOR radio. Within three months the album had gone gold, and five months later it went platinum. It would eventually sell over six million copies, thanks to the album rock staples \"You Really Got Me,\" \"Jamie\\'s Cryin\\',\" and \"Runnin\\' with the Devil.\" Van Halen II, released in 1979, continued the band\\'s success, as \"Dance the Night Away\" became their first Top 20 single. Women and Children First (1980) didn\\'t have any charting singles, but was a success on the album charts, reaching number six. The band supported the album with their first headlining, international arena tour, and were quickly on their way to being superstars. Released in 1981, Fair Warning wasn\\'t quite as popular as their previous records, yet it still peaked at number six. Diver Down, released in 1982, was a huge hit, spawning a number 12 cover of Roy Orbison\\'s \"(Oh) Pretty Woman\" and reaching number three. While all of their previous albums were successful, Van Halen didn\\'t become superstars until 1984, when their album 1984 became an across-the-board smash. Released on New Year\\'s Day, 1984 rocketed to number two on the strength of the number one single \"Jump.\" Like many songs on the album, \"Jump\" was driven by Eddie\\'s new synthesizer, and while Roth was initially reluctant to use electronics, the expansion of the group\\'s sound was widely praised. Throughout 1984, Van Halen gained steam, as \"I\\'ll Wait\" and \"Panama\" became Top 15 singles and \"Hot for Teacher\" became a radio and MTV staple. Despite the group\\'s breakthrough success, things were not well within the band. During their 1984 tour, each member played separate solo sets and was physically separated on the stage. Roth was unhappy with Eddie\\'s appearance on Michael Jackson\\'s 1983 hit \"Beat It,\" and Eddie grew tired of Roth\\'s comic antics. In 1985, Roth released a solo EP, Crazy from the Heat, which spawned hit covers of \"California Girls\" and \"Just a Gigolo/I Ain\\'t Got Nobody.\" When Roth delayed the recording of Van Halen\\'s follow-up to 1984, he was fired from the band. Most observers were taken by surprise when Sammy Hagar was named as Roth\\'s replacement. The former lead singer of Montrose, Hagar\\'s solo career had been sporadically successful, highlighted by such arena metal hits as \"Three-Lock Box\" and \"I Can\\'t Drive 55.\" Though many critics suspected Hagar wouldn\\'t be able to sustain Van Halen\\'s remarkable success, his first album with the band, 1986\\'s 5150, was a huge hit, reaching number one and spawning the hit singles \"Why Can\\'t This Be Love,\" \"Dreams,\" and \"Love Walks In.\" Released in 1988, OU812 was just as successful, earning stronger reviews than its predecessor and generating the hits \"When It\\'s Love\" and \"Finish What You Started.\" For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, released in 1991, was another number one hit, partially due to the hit MTV video for \"Right Now.\" Van Halen followed the album with their first live record, the double-album Van Halen Live: Right Here, Right Now in 1993. By the spring 1995 release of Balance, tensions between Eddie Van Halen and Sammy Hagar had grown considerably. Eddie had recently undergone well-publicized treatment for alcoholism, and Hagar was notorious for his party-hearty ways, even writing a paean to Amsterdam\\'s hash bars with \"Amsterdam\" on Balance. Furthermore, the band had become subject to criticism that it simply repeated a formula. While Balance was successful, entering the charts at number one and selling two million copies shortly after its release, it stalled quickly afterward. The band wanted to release a greatest-hits collection, but Hagar balked at the idea, escalating tensions even further. Following a skirmish in 1996 over the recording of a song for the Twister soundtrack, Eddie decided to make a change by switching singers. Van Halen began recording new material with Roth without informing Hagar, who went ballistic upon learning of the group\\'s reunion. According to Hagar, Eddie fired him shortly afterward; Eddie claimed Hagar quit. Roth proceeded to record two new songs for Van Halen\\'s Best Of, Vol. 1, and once the reunion became public, the rock media reacted positively to the news; MTV began airing a welcome back commercial days after the announcement. However, the reunion was not to be. Following an appearance at the MTV Music Awards, Eddie Van Halen fired Roth from the band, claiming that he was only on board to record two new songs. Roth said that he was duped into recording the songs, believing that the reunion was permanent. Former Extreme vocalist Gary Cherone was announced as the band\\'s new lead singer. Though the resulting Best Of, Vol. 1 was a success, Eddie\\'s reputation as a nice guy was tarnished once the entire affair was over. Cherone\\'s long-awaited debut with Van Halen, entitled Van Halen III, was finally released in March of 1998. Although the album debuted high on the charts, crashing in at number three, it quickly slipped down, since the reception to the album from fans, critics, and radio was mixed. After Van Halen III proved to be the worst-selling album of Van Halen\\'s long and illustrious career (the ensuing world tour was poorly attended as well), Cherone was dismissed from Van Halen in 1999. Immediately, rumors began to swirl once more of an impending David Lee Roth/Van Halen reunion. Things were kept hush-hush in the Van Halen camp until early 2001, when David Lee Roth went public on his website with an update, confirming that he had recorded several new songs with the band but hadn\\'t heard back from them since the previous summer. Only a few days after Roth\\'s news, Eddie Van Halen admitted to the public that he was battling cancer, but was told by his doctors that chances were good for a complete recovery. In the summer of 2001, Eddie told MTV News that the band\\'s remaining members had penned a total of three albums\\' worth of new material and that they were still unsure of who their next singer would be. Months later, the band parted ways with Warner Bros., its label since 1979. The bandmembers blamed the label for promoting younger bands, while also admitting that they had not yet found Cherone\\'s replacement and were no longer considering Roth. The next three years found various members tending to situations both personal and professional. Eddie and longtime wife Valerie Bertinelli separated, Michael Anthony began making regular appearances with Sammy Hagar\\'s Warboritas, and in a surprise move, David Lee Roth and Hagar hit the road together for the popular Heavyweight Champs of Rock &amp; Roll Tour. In 2004, the band announced that Hagar would return to the fold for an American tour in support of a new greatest-hits collection, The Best of Both Worlds. The shows were undeniably successful, but tensions were high, and Hagar and Anthony returned to the Warboritas the following year. In 2007, Van Halen were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and rumors of a reunion tour with Roth began to circulate again. Those rumors were confirmed on August 17th when the group announced legitimate dates, along with a controversial lineup change that replaced Michael Anthony with Eddie\\'s son Wolfgang on bass. The tour kicked off in September and went on to gross over $93 million, the most successful tour in the band\\'s history.Riding this great success, Van Halen decided to head into the studio to cut their first album since 1998\\'s III. Working with producer John Shanks, the band recorded the album in 2011, then launched their full-scale comeback in the early days of 2012, performing a showcase concert at Cafe Wha? on January 5, with the single \"Tattoo\" arriving five days later. The full-length album, A Different Kind of Truth, followed in February 2012. Greeted by generally positive reviews, A Different Kind of Truth debuted at two on the Billboard Top 200 and saw a similar high position throughout the world; it would later be certified gold in Canada. Van Halen supported the album with a worldwide tour, which included a June 21, 2013 gig at the Tokyo Dome that was later released as a double album in 2015. Tokyo Dome Live in Concert was Van Halen\\'s first-ever live album with David Lee Roth. In the late 2010s, Eddie Van Halen was once again battling cancer, this time of the throat. Eddie died on October 6, 2020, at the age of 65. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'With a limitless supply of dirty riffs, snarling vocals, and timelessly catchy, anthemic choruses, AC/DC is one of the most important and most lasting forces in hard rock. Founded in the early \\'70s by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, the Aussie band exploded onto the international stage in 1979 with the release of their multi-platinum-selling sixth album, Highway to Hell. The death of charismatic frontman Bon Scott in 1980 threatened to derail the group, but AC/DC powered through. They recruited Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson and unleashed their most successful effort to date, Back in Black, which has become the second best-selling album in history. The band continued to help define the sound of hard rock and metal throughout the \\'80s, \\'90s, and beyond, spawning countless imitators and enjoying steady, consistent commercial success. They also became one of the best examples of arena rock, playing to enormous crowds as the years went on, and rocking as hard as ever on studio albums like 1990\\'s pop-glinted The Razor\\'s Edge and 2020\\'s Power Up, both of which reached the upper tiers of multiple charts.AC/DC were formed in 1973 in Australia by guitarist Malcolm Young after his previous band, the Velvet Underground, collapsed (no relation to the seminal American group). With his younger brother Angus serving as lead guitarist, the band played some gigs around Sydney. Angus was only 18 at the time, and his sister suggested that he wear his school uniform on-stage; the look became the band\\'s visual trademark. While still in Sydney, the original lineup featuring singer Dave Evans cut a single called \"Can I Sit Next to You,\" with ex-Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young (Malcolm and Angus\\' older brother) producing.The band moved to Melbourne the following year, where drummer Phil Rudd (formerly of the Coloured Balls) and bassist Mark Evans joined the lineup. The band\\'s chauffeur, Bon Scott, became the lead vocalist when singer Dave Evans refused to go on-stage. Previously, Scott had been vocalist for the Australian prog rock bands Fraternity and the Valentines. More importantly, he helped cement the group\\'s image as brutes -- he had several convictions for minor criminal offenses and was rejected by the Australian Army for being \"socially maladjusted.\" AC/DC were socially maladjusted. Throughout their career they favored crude double entendres and violent imagery, all spiked with a mischievous sense of fun.The group released two albums -- High Voltage and T.N.T. -- in Australia in 1974 and 1975. Material from the two records comprised the 1976 release High Voltage in the U.S. and U.K.; the group also toured both countries. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap followed at the end of the year. In the fall of 1977, AC/DC released Let There Be Rock, which became their first album to chart in the U.S. Mark Evans left the band soon after, with Cliff Williams taking his place. Powerage, released in spring of 1978, expanded their audience even further, thanks in no small part to their dynamic live shows (which were captured on 1978\\'s live If You Want Blood You\\'ve Got It). What really broke the doors down for the band was the following year\\'s Highway to Hell, which hit number 17 in the U.S. and number eight in the U.K., becoming the group\\'s first million-seller.AC/DC\\'s train was derailed when Bon Scott died on February 19, 1980. The official coroner\\'s report stated he had \"drunk himself to death.\" In March, the band replaced Scott with Brian Johnson. The following month, they recorded Back in Black, which would prove to be their biggest album, selling over ten million copies in the U.S. alone. For the next few years, they were one of the largest rock bands in the world, with For Those About to Rock We Salute You topping the charts in the U.S. In 1983, Rudd left after the recording of Flick of the Switch; he was replaced by Simon Wright.With Flick of the Switch, AC/DC\\'s commercial standing began to slip, and they weren\\'t able to reverse their slide until 1990\\'s The Razor\\'s Edge, which spawned the hit \"Thunderstruck.\" While not the commercial powerhouse they were during the late \\'70s and early \\'80s, the \\'90s saw AC/DC maintain their status as a top international concert draw. In the fall of 1995, their 16th album, Ballbreaker, was released. Produced by Rick Rubin, the album received some of the most positive reviews of AC/DC\\'s career; it also entered the American charts at number four and sold over a million copies in its first six months of release. Stiff Upper Lip followed in early 2000 with similar results. AC/DC signed a multi-album deal with Sony in 2001 that resulted in a slew of reissues and DVDs, and they returned to the studio in 2008 for Black Ice, an all-new collection of songs that topped charts in numerous countries (including Australia, the U.S., and the U.K.) and was followed by the group\\'s first world tour since 2001. Two years later, the band\\'s music was featured heavily in the action movie Iron Man 2, and a compilation was released in conjunction with the film under the title Iron Man 2. As AC/DC began work on a new album with producer Brendan O\\'Brien in 2014, they announced that Malcolm Young was suffering from dementia and had left the band; his nephew Stevie Young took his place at recording sessions and the accompanying 40th anniversary tour, and subsequently joined the group full-time. Just prior to the December release of Rock or Bust, drummer Phil Rudd was arrested under charges of attempting to procure a murder, threatening to kill, and possession of cannabis and methamphetamine. Although the arranged murder charges were dropped, the others remained and the drummer\\'s future with the band was uncertain. Nevertheless, AC/DC marched forward with the release of Rock or Bust and plans for a tour in 2015. In 2017, Malcolm Young died in November at the age of 64. Following a two-year hiatus, the band reunited with producer Brendan O\\'Brien for their 17th studio album, Power Up, which became their third consecutive number one album in Australia and their third chart-topper in the U.S. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Ted Nugent is a stalwart American hard rock singer, songwriter, and guitarist who is as divisive as he is legendary. Throughout his lengthy career, the Motor City Madman has reveled in the controversy and criticism that always seem to follow in his path -- his pro-right-wing beliefs and pro-gun advocacy have caused condemnation from his detractors -- but his wildman persona and knack for penning arena rock anthems made him one of the biggest rock stars of the late \\'70s and early \\'80s. Emerging in the 1960s with the psych-rock combo the Amboy Dukes, who scored big in 1968 with the single \"Journey to the Center of the Mind,\" Nugent eventually went solo, issuing multi-platinum albums like Cat Scratch Fever and Double Live Gonzo! After finding success in the early \\'90s with the rock supergroup Damn Yankees, Nugent began exploring other media outlets, starring in his own outdoor television program, hosting reality shows, and becoming a prominent voice in the right-wing community, even going so far as to hint at presidential aspirations. During this time he also continued to perform live and release new material like 2007\\'s Love Grenade, 2014\\'s Shutup &amp; Jam!, 2018\\'s Music Made Me Do It, and 2022\\'s Detroit Muscle. Born on December 13, 1948, in Detroit, Michigan, Nugent became interested in rock &amp; roll early in the game, picking up the guitar as a youngster, while his disciplinarian father passed his beliefs down to Nugent. In the \\'60s, Nugent formed his first bands (including Royal High Boys and Lourdes), drawing inspiration from such British blues-rockers as the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. But it wasn\\'t until the formation of the Amboy Dukes that the Nuge got his first taste of stardom (it was also around this time that Nugent began playing a Gibson Byrdland guitar, a model that would be instantly associated with him throughout his career). The other members of the group didn\\'t exactly share Nugent\\'s clean-living lifestyle, as proven by their psychedelic hit single \"Journey to the Center of the Mind,\" which Nugent claimed he didn\\'t know at the time was about being \"under the influence.\" The band managed to issue several albums throughout the late \\'60s -- 1967\\'s self-titled debut, 1968\\'s Journey to the Center of the Mind, and 1969\\'s Migration -- as the group fit in well with other high-energy rock bands that emerged from the Motor City, the MC5 and the Stooges in particular. With bandmembers coming and going at an alarming rate, Nugent remained the only constant member -- eventually officially changing the band\\'s name to Ted Nugent &amp; the Amboy Dukes by the \\'70s, and issuing 1971\\'s Survival of the Fittest, 1973\\'s Call of the Wild, and 1974\\'s Tooth, Fang &amp; Claw. While none of these releases exactly stormed the charts, Nugent and his cohorts remained an in-demand concert draw, as he also set up \"guitar duels\" on-stage around this time (battling with MC5\\'s Wayne Kramer and Mahogany Rush\\'s Frank Marino, among others).By the mid-\\'70s, Nugent decided to finally ditch the Amboy Dukes name and set out on his own, assembling a first-rate backing band that included second guitarist/vocalist Derek St. Holmes, bassist Rob Grange, and drummer Cliff Davies. By 1975, the new band was signed to Aerosmith\\'s management company (Leber &amp; Krebs), as well as the same record company, Columbia, resulting in the release of Nugent\\'s self-titled debut in November of the same year. The band immediately struck a chord with the heavy metal/hard rock crowd from coast to coast, due to the band\\'s over-the-top stage show. But the bandmembers\\' relationship with Nugent was rocky at best -- Nugent wanted complete control of the band, while the others wanted it to be more of a democracy. The end result was St. Holmes leaving the band prior to the sessions of their sophomore effort, 1976\\'s Free-for-All (which saw a then-unknown singer by the name of Meat Loaf filling in for the departed singer).St. Holmes returned, however, in time for the album\\'s ensuing tour, and by the release of 1977\\'s Cat Scratch Fever (which spawned the hit single title track), Nugent and company were one of the top rock bands in the U.S. -- storming the charts and selling out arenas coast to coast. By now, Nugent had assumed the stage persona of a caveman -- hitting the stage dressed in nothing but a skimpy loincloth and knee-high boots, and would often begin his show by swinging out on a rope à la Tarzan (!). Like other rock acts of the \\'70s (Kiss, Cheap Trick, Peter Frampton, etc.), Nugent used a live album -- 1978\\'s classic Double Live Gonzo! -- to catapult his career to the next level of stardom. But despite all the success, the members of his band began deserting him one by one over the course of such albums as 1978\\'s Weekend Warriors, 1979\\'s State of Shock, and 1980\\'s Scream Dream. To add insult to injury, Nugent found himself bankrupt around this time, due to several failed business ventures and poor management. The \\'80s saw Nugent continuing to tour and crank out albums like Intensities in 10 Cities, Nugent, Penetrator, Little Miss Dangerous, and If You Can\\'t Lick \\'Em...Lick \\'Em), but it appeared as through the Nuge was trying to keep pace with the burgeoning pop-metal crowd instead of sticking to the raw and raging rock that brought him success in the first place. Nugent also tried his hand at acting around this time, appearing as a drug dealer in an episode of the hit TV series Miami Vice in 1986. By the end of the decade, Nugent joined the rock supergroup Damn Yankees (also featuring former Night Ranger bassist/singer Jack Blades, former Styx guitarist/singer Tommy Shaw, and drummer Michael Cartellone) -- resulting in the quartet\\'s self-titled debut in 1990, which became a surprise hit due to their Top Ten power ballad \"High Enough.\" But ultimately, the union proved to be short-lived; after only one more album (1992\\'s lackluster Don\\'t Tread), the band called it quits. Nugent returned to his solo career, issuing his best album in over a decade, 1995\\'s back-to-basics Spirit of the Wild, while several archival releases turned up throughout the \\'90s: 1993\\'s three-disc box set Out of Control, 1997\\'s Live at Hammersmith \\'79, as well as his first three albums reissued with added tracks and newly remastered sound in 1999 by the Epic/Legacy label (also issued at the same time was the first truly comprehensive compilation of the Amboy Dukes, the 18-track Loaded for Bear). The Nuge was also the subject of an interesting VH1 Behind the Music episode. He continued to tour well into the 21st century (landing the opening slot on Kiss\\' Farewell U.S. Tour in 2000), and issued the third live collection of his career, Full Bluntal Nugity, in 2001. That same year, the Nuge penned his own autobiography, the perfectly titled God, Guns, &amp; Rock n\\' Roll. His Spitfire-issued 12th long-player, Craveman, dropped in 2002, followed by Love Grenade in 2007. He next embraced the digital realm by releasing the two-disc, 30-track MP3 online song bundle Happy Defiance Day Everyday over the 4th of July weekend in 2010. In 2014 Nugent released his 14th studio album, Shutup &amp; Jam!, which featured a guest appearance from Sammy Hagar, followed by the R&amp;B-tinged Music Made Me Do It in 2018, which reached number 24 on Billboard\\'s Top Independent Albums chart. Three years later, Nugent released Detroit Muscle, which was co-produced by fellow Motor City rock legend Mike Lutz (Brownsville Station). In addition to music, Nugent has gotten involved in politics, hosting a number one morning radio show in Detroit; has run his own hunting camp and issues instructional videotapes (as well as the Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild PBS video series); owns his own hunting supply store; has been appointed to the board of directors of the National Rifle Association; writes columns regularly for a number of different magazines; and even sells his very own beef jerky (called Gonzo Meat Biltong)! ~ Greg Prato'\n",

      "'Aerosmith were one of the most popular hard rock bands of the \\'70s, setting the style and sound of hard rock and heavy metal for the next two decades with their raunchy, bluesy swagger. The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond.In the meantime, they developed a prototype for power ballads with \"Dream On,\" a piano ballad that was orchestrated with strings and distorted guitars. Aerosmith\\'s ability to pull off both ballads and rock &amp; roll made them extremely popular during the mid-\\'70s, when they had a string of gold and platinum albums. By the early \\'80s, the group\\'s audience had declined as the band fell prey to drug and alcohol abuse. However, their career was far from over -- in the late \\'80s, Aerosmith pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks in rock history, returning to the top of the charts with a group of albums that equaled, if not surpassed, the popularity of their \\'70s albums.In 1970, the first incarnation of Aerosmith formed when vocalist Steven Tyler met guitarist Joe Perry while working at a Sunapee, New Hampshire, ice cream parlor. Tyler, who originally was a drummer, and Perry decided to form a power trio with bassist Tom Hamilton. The group soon expanded to a quartet, adding a second guitarist called Ray Tabano; he was quickly replaced by Brad Whitford, a former member of Earth Inc. With the addition of drummer Joey Kramer, Tyler became the full-time lead singer by the end of year. Aerosmith relocated to Boston at the end of 1970.After playing clubs in the Massachusetts and New York areas for two years, the group landed a record contract with Columbia Records in 1972. Aerosmith\\'s self-titled debut album was released in the fall of 1973, climbing to number 166. \"Dream On\" was released as the first single and it was a minor hit, reaching number 59. For the next year, the band built a fan base by touring America, supporting groups as diverse as the Kinks, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Sha Na Na, and Mott the Hoople. The performance of Get Your Wings (1974), the group\\'s second album and the first produced by Jack Douglas, benefited from their constant touring, spending a total of 86 weeks on the chart.Aerosmith\\'s third record, 1975\\'s Toys in the Attic, was their breakthrough album both commercially and artistically. By the time it was recorded, the band\\'s sound had developed into a sleek, hard-driving hard rock powered by simple, almost brutal, blues-based riffs. Many critics at the time labeled the group as punk rockers, and it\\'s easy to see why -- instead of adhering to the world music pretensions of Led Zeppelin or the prolonged gloomy mysticism of Black Sabbath, Aerosmith stripped heavy metal to its basic core, spitting out spare riffs that not only rocked, but rolled. Steven Tyler\\'s lyrics were filled with double entendres and clever jokes, and the entire band had a streetwise charisma that separated it from the heavy, lumbering arena rockers of the era. Toys in the Attic captured the essence of the newly invigorated Aerosmith. \"Sweet Emotion,\" the first single from Toys in the Attic, broke into the Top 40 in the summer of 1975, with the album reaching number 11 shortly afterward. Its success prompted the re-release of the power ballad \"Dream On,\" which shot into the Top Ten in early 1976. Both Aerosmith and Get Your Wings climbed back up the charts in the wake of Toys in the Attic. \"Walk This Way,\" the final single from Toys in the Attic, was released around the time of the group\\'s new 1976 album, Rocks. Although it didn\\'t feature a Top Ten hit like \"Walk This Way,\" Rocks went platinum quickly, peaking at number three.In early 1977, Aerosmith took a break and prepared material for their fifth album. Released late in 1977, Draw the Line was another hit, climbing to number 11 on the U.S. charts, but it showed signs of exhaustion. In addition to another tour in 1978, the band appeared in the movie Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, performing \"Come Together,\" which eventually became a number 23 hit. Live! Bootleg appeared late in 1978 and became another success, reaching number 13. Aerosmith recorded Night in the Ruts in 1979, releasing the record at the end of the year. By the time of its release, Joe Perry had left the band to form the Joe Perry Project. Night in the Ruts performed respectably, climbing to number 14 and going gold, yet it was the least successful Aerosmith record to date. Brad Whitford left the group in early 1980, forming the Whitsford-St. Holmes Band with former Ted Nugent guitarist Derek St. Holmes.As Aerosmith regrouped with new guitarists Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay, the band released Aerosmith\\'s Greatest Hits in late 1980; the record would eventually sell over six million copies. The new lineup of Aerosmith released Rock in a Hard Place in 1982. Peaking at number 32, it failed to match the performance of Night in the Ruts. Perry and Whitford returned to the band in 1984 and the group began a reunion tour dubbed Back in the Saddle. Early in the tour, Tyler collapsed on-stage, offering proof that the bandmembers hadn\\'t conquered their notorious drug and alcohol addictions. The following year, Aerosmith released Done with Mirrors, the original lineup\\'s first record since 1979 and their first for Geffen Records. Although it didn\\'t perform as well as Rock in a Hard Place, the album showed that the band was revitalized.After the release of Done with Mirrors, Tyler and Perry completed rehabilitation programs. In 1986, the pair appeared on Run-D.M.C.\\'s cover of \"Walk This Way,\" along with appearing in the video. \"Walk This Way\" became a hit, reaching number four and receiving saturation airplay on MTV. \"Walk This Way\" set the stage for the band\\'s full-scale comeback effort, the Bruce Fairbairn-produced Permanent Vacation (1987). Tyler and Perry collaborated with professional hard rock songwriters like Holly Knight and Desmond Child, resulting in the hits \"Dude (Looks Like a Lady),\" \"Rag Doll,\" and \"Angel.\" Permanent Vacation peaked at number 11 and sold over three million copies.Pump, released in 1989, continued the band\\'s winning streak, reaching number five, selling over four million copies, and spawning the Top Ten singles \"Love in an Elevator,\" \"Janie\\'s Got a Gun,\" and \"What It Takes.\" Aerosmith released Get a Grip in 1993. Like Permanent Vacation and Pump, Get a Grip was produced by Bruce Fairbairn and featured significant contributions by professional songwriters. The album was as successful as the band\\'s previous two records, featuring the hit singles \"Livin\\' on the Edge,\" \"Cryin\\',\" and \"Amazing.\" In 1994, Aerosmith released Big Ones, a compilation of hits from their Geffen years that fulfilled their contract with the label; it went double platinum shortly after its release. While Aerosmith was at the height of their revitalized popularity in the early \\'90s, the group signed a lucrative multi-million dollar contract with Columbia Records, even though they still owed Geffen two albums. It wasn\\'t until 1995 that the band was able to begin working on their first record under the new contract -- nearly five years after the contract was signed. The making of Aerosmith albums usually had been difficult affairs, but the recording of Nine Lives was plagued with bad luck. The band went through a number of producers and songwriters before settling on Kevin Shirley in 1996. More damaging, however, was the dismissal of the band\\'s manager, Tim Collins, who\\'d been responsible for bringing the band back from the brink of addiction. Upon his firing, Collins insinuated that Steven Tyler was using hard drugs again, an allegation that Aerosmith adamantly denied. Under such circumstances, recording became quite difficult, and when Nine Lives finally appeared in the spring of 1997, it was greeted with great anticipation, yet the initial reviews were mixed and even though album debuted at number one, it quickly fell down the charts. The live A Little South of Sanity followed in 1998. Three years later, Aerosmith strutted their stuff on the Super Bowl halftime special on CBS with the likes of Mary J. Blige, Nelly, *NSYNC, and Britney Spears, just prior to issuing their heart-stomping Just Push Play in March 2001. Next up for the band was a blues album, Honkin\\' on Bobo, released in 2004, along with two live album/DVDs, You Gotta Move and Rockin\\' the Joint. Another greatest-hits collection, Devil\\'s Got a New Disguise: The Very Best of Aerosmith arrived in 2006.From there, Aerosmith entered a period of volatility. A world tour followed in 2007 and the group attempted to record a new studio album with producer Brendan O\\'Brien but the sessions were never finalized. Instead, another tour followed in 2009, this time a supporting jaunt for Aerosmith\\'s own special edition of the Guitar Hero video game. This tour proved to be ill-fated, with Steven Tyler suffering a leg injury in June, then falling off the stage in August, leading to the cancellation of the subsequent dates. As 2009 came to a close, Joe Perry released a solo album called Have Guitar, Will Travel as Tyler announced that he was planning on \"working on the brand of myself,\" which included working on an autobiography and a solo album, along with a stint in rehab to wean himself off painkillers prescribed due to his stage injuries. Before Tyler embarked on solo projects, he returned to the band for a series of concerts in 2010, in the midst of which it was announced that the singer would be a new judge on the televised singing competition American Idol. Perry voiced his dissatisfaction in the press but Tyler\\'s time on American Idol helped raise the band\\'s profile, while providing a platform for Tyler\\'s memoir, Does the Noise in My Head Bother You? The book performed better than his two solo singles -- 2010\\'s \"Love Lives\" and 2011\\'s \"(It) Feels So Good\" -- singles that did not wind up signaling his departure from Aerosmith. Tyler continued to tour with the band and in 2011 they recorded a new album with producer Jack Douglas, the man who helmed their classic \\'70s LPs. Originally scheduled for release in summer of 2012, Music from Another Dimension! wound up being pushed back to that year\\'s holiday season, by which time Tyler had departed his judgeship on American Idol. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Steppenwolf were one of the pioneering bands of American hard rock, conjuring the roaring sound of a biker gang laying claim to the highway on hits like \"Born to be Wild\" and \"Magic Carpet Ride.\" Like most early hard rock acts, Steppenwolf\\'s approach was steeped in the blues, but with an added level of lyrical swagger and a full-bodied attack that added hints of acid rock. The key elements of their sound were the rough, throaty vocals of leader John Kay, the hard, barking tone of the eclectic guitar, and the thick, muscular voice of the overdriven electric organ. While wild good times informed most of their hits, as their career went on they shifted their focus to more serious themes, including politics, militarism, feminism, and the environment. Steppenwolf\\'s initial run is documented thoroughly by the 2021 box set Magic Carpet Ride: The ABC/Dunhill Years 1967-1971, while their second era in the 1970s is summarized on the 1977 compilation Reborn to be Wild. The Steppenwolf story starts in Oshawa, Ontario, in 1964, with a rock band called Jack London and the Sparrows. Eager to move up in the world, they relocated to Toronto, and they cut a single, \"If You Don\\'t Want My Love,\" that was a major hit in Canada. In 1965, they brought aboard bassist Nick St. Nicholas and drummer Jerry Edmonton, and by the end of the year, frontman London left to go out on his own. The group revamped their lineup, adding lead singer and guitarist John Kay, lead guitarist Dennis Edmonton, and keyboard player Goldy McJohn. The new version of the group boasted a tougher, more blues-oriented sound, and they adjusted their name to Sparrow. In 1966, they began touring regularly in America, and were signed to Columbia Records, but their debut single, \"Tomorrow\\'s Ship,\" was a flop and they were quickly dropped. Undeterred, Sparrow moved their operations to California, and settled in San Francisco after a brief, unproductive stay in Los Angeles. They were soon playing the ballroom circuit and sharing bills with the likes of the Doors and the Steve Miller Band, but in June 1967, Dennis Edmonton would drop out and enjoy success as a songwriter and studio musician under the name Mars Bonfire. Michael Monarch took over as Sparrow\\'s lead guitarist, though it wasn\\'t long before the group decided to call it a day. However, fate stepped in when Kay and his wife rented an apartment where his next-door neighbor was Gabriel Mekler, a producer and A&amp;R man for Dunhill Records. Mekler wanted to hear some of Kay\\'s music, and after playing him some tapes of Sparrow, Mekler urged Kay to get the band back together. Jerry Edmonton, Goldy McJohn, and Michael Monarch were willing to give it another chance, and Rushton Moreve came on board to play bass. After cutting some demos, Mekler arranged for the band to sign with Dunhill; initial sessions at United Western Studio went nowhere, but relocating to American Recording Studio, where they worked with engineers Bill Cooper and Richie Podolor, pushed them in the right direction, and there they knocked out their debut album in less than a week. Released in January 1968, Steppenwolf included \"Born to Be Wild,\" written by former bandmate Mars Bonfire, which became a massive hit single and introduced the phrase \"heavy metal thunder\" to the rock lexicon. The single peaked at number two on the American charts, and the album fared nearly as well, topping out at number six. As Steppenwolf dominated the radio and sales charts, they hit the road for a long string of live concerts, and the presence of \"Born to Be Wild\" and \"The Pusher\" on the soundtrack of the counterculture blockbuster Easy Rider fanned the flames further.Eager to keep things rolling, the band\\'s follow-up, Steppenwolf the Second, was released in October 1968, and featured another smash single, \"Magic Carpet Ride,\" which rose to number three. While the writing and recording of the LP was rushed, Steppenwolf the Second still went gold, but the rigors of the road led to Rushton Moreve departing from the group, and Sparrow bassist Nick St. Nicholas eagerly resumed playing with his old friends. (Moreve died in 1981 following an auto accident.) March 1969 saw the release of their third full-length, At Your Birthday Party, which contained the Top Ten single \"Rock Me.\" Only four months later, Dunhill brought out Early Steppenwolf, an LP drawn from a May 1967 club gig in San Francisco, when the band was still known as Sparrow; the highlight of the album was a 21-minute version of \"The Pusher.\" As the record arrived in stores, Steppenwolf were working on their next studio album, this time without Michael Monarch, who attributed his departure to creative differences. Larry Byrom debuted on lead guitar on Monster, issued in November 1969, which found Steppenwolf exploring political themes as America\\'s mood became increasingly divided. An edited version of the title track (over nine minutes on the LP) and \"Move Over\" both made it into the lower reaches of the Top 40, and the album was certified gold. Steppenwolf\\'s second live album, the more up-to-date Steppenwolf Live, came out in April 1970. It was recorded during concerts at the Santa Monica Civic Center, and added two studio tracks as a bonus; one of the concert cuts, \"Hey Lawdy Mama,\" was pulled as a single and peaked at Number 35. Not long after the Live LP hit stores, Nick St. Nicholas was fired due to erratic behavior. George Biondo was hired to take his place on the bass.By the time Steppenwolf 7 appeared in November 1970, ABC Records had taken control of Dunhill, and the disc was issued as a joint ABC/Dunhill release. It was also the first Steppenwolf album without Gabriel Mekler receiving producer credit; Richie Podolor, who had helped engineer all their studio work to date, was cited as producer for the first time. The album made Number 19 on the album charts and went gold, but none of its singles reached the Top 40, and Larry Byrom left the band. Kent Henry, formerly of Blues Image, became Steppenwolf\\'s lead guitarist, and appeared on For Ladies Only, issued in November 1971. It was a commercial disappointment, peaking at Number 54, and after a February 1972 show in Los Angeles, Steppenwolf broke up. ABC/Dunhill had already issued a \"Best of\" collection, Gold: Their Greatest Hits, in March 1971, and less than a year later, the label released a farewell album of lesser-known deep cuts, 1967-1972 Rest In Peace, in February 1972. John Kay cut a pair of solo albums, 1972\\'s Forgotten Songs &amp; Unsung Heroes and 1973\\'s My Sportin\\' Life, while Goldy McJohn and Jerry Edmonton teamed up with Rod Prince and Roy Cox of the Bubble Puppy in the short-lived group Manbeast. After their post-Steppenwolf projects failed to find an audience, in 1974 the group re-formed with a lineup of John Kay, Jerry Edmonton, Goldy McJohn, George Biondo, and guitarist Bobby Cochran. The new edition of Steppenwolf signed with the CBS-distributed MUMS label, which released Slow Flux in 1974. The group toured heavily in support, and Kay dismissed McJohn in February 1975 after becoming disenchanted with the quality of his work. Andy Chapin became Steppenwolf\\'s keyboard player in time to record 1975\\'s Hour of the Wolf, which was issued by another CBS offshoot, Epic. While Slow Flux peaked at number 47 on the album charts and the single \"Straight Shootin\\' Woman\" reached the Top 30, Hour of the Wolf rose no higher than number 155. After cutting the 1976 contractual obligation album Skullduggery, Kay once again broke up Steppenwolf. In 1977, Epic released Reborn to be Wild, a compilation taken from the three reunion albums. After their second breakup, Goldy McJohn and Nick St. Nicholas toured the oldies circuit with a band they called \"The New Steppenwolf,\" and while Kay initially gave them permission to use the name, he withdrew his approval and the act petered out in 1980. After the New Steppenwolf faded out, Kay assembled a band he called John Kay &amp; Steppenwolf; he was the only original member on board, with the rest of the lineup featuring guitarist Michael Palmer, bassist Kurtis Teel, keyboard player Danny Ironstone, and drummer Steve Palmer. Teel and Ironstone were replaced by Chad Peery and Brett Tuggle by the time they recorded 1981\\'s Live in London, which was initially issued only in Australia. With Michael Wilk on keyboards, the band cut an album, 1982\\'s Wolftracks, which was recorded live in the studio to digital tape; it was issued by Attic Records in Canada and by the audiophile label Nautilus in the United States. A second album for Attic, Paradox, followed in 1984. Next, Kay disbanded this edition of the group in favor of an entirely new set of musicians – Michael Wilk on bass and keyboards, Rocket Ritchotte on guitar, and Ron Hurst on drums. In addition to frequent road work, this version of John Kay &amp; Steppenwolf released two albums, 1987\\'s Rock &amp; Roll Rebels and 1990\\'s Rise &amp; Shine. In 1993, original drummer Jerry Edmonton died in an auto accident in Santa Ynez, California. Despite periodic lineup changes, Kay kept Steppenwolf on the road until October 2007, when he staged a farewell concert in Aberdeen, Maryland. Once again, Kay changed his mind, and in June 2009, he revived the band and set out on the road. August 2017 saw the death of original keyboard player Goldy McJohn, who succumbed to a heart attack at his home in Nashville, Tennessee. The Steppenwolf train finally stopped with the last date on their October 2018 tour; 13 months later, a post from Kay on Steppenwolf\\'s website declared the band was done. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "\"The name of Yngwie Malmsteen has always stood for uncompromising excellence. In a career that now spans more than 40 years he has proven himself to be a unique artist. You can try to categorise him in any way you wish. But the manner in which this supreme Swedish craftsman has continually developed his music makes Malmsteen sublimely transcend any definition you attempt to impose.He now has a catalogue of 21 solo studio albums, each of which has much to commend. Moreover, the guitarist played a crucial role in helping to establish Alcatrazz as a significant force in the 1980s. Malmsteen's artistry has always clearly incorporated a healthy virtuosity, but his talent goes well beyond a comprehensive control of the guitar. The man is a fine composer and, on recent releases, has also showcased a strong vocal presence.One aspect of his approach has always shone through, and that is an abidingly deep respect for the music he plays. Malmsteen has constantly done whatever it takes to bring out all of the colour, shade and hue embedded in each one of his compositions. Merely doing a very good job isn't an option. He wants to go – and does go - well beyond such limitations, into the rarefied realms inhabited by an elite number of timeless masters. This has never been more focused and informed than on his startling new album 'Parabellum'.\"\n",

      "'A seminal influence on the evolution of extreme metal, Venom were at the vanguard of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Influenced by the raw intensity of Motörhead and the visual flash of Kiss, they developed a dark, blistering sound that paved the way for the subsequent rise of thrash music; similarly, their macabre, proudly satanic image -- their landmark debut was titled Welcome to Hell -- proved a major inspiration for the legions of death and black metal bands to appear in their wake, even lending the genre its name with the release of their influential 1982 sophomore LP Black Metal. Despite enduring countless personnel changes over the years, and more than a little internal acrimony, Venom continued to tour and release new music, issuing their 15th studio long-player, Storm the Gates, in 2018. Formed in 1978 in Newcastle, England, Venom went through some structural changes before settling on a core trio comprising singer/bassist Conrad \"Cronos\" Lant, guitarist Jeff \"Mantas\" Dunn, and drummer Tony \"Abaddon\" Bray. Drawing inspiration from a versatile array of artists including Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Sex Pistols, the Who, the Tubes, and Elvis Presley, the band eschewed technical prowess in favor of kinetic power, employing a savagely fast style of sonic deviltry that had as much in common with hardcore punk as it did heavy metal -- despite their lyrical and visual obsession with the devil, the group has consistently stated that they prefer shock value over actual Satanism. Venom issued their debut album, Welcome to Hell, in 1981 via Neat Records. Rough, noisy, and spilling over with evil intent, the LP, and its like-minded follow-up Black Metal (1982), helped pave the way for death metal and thrash -- neither album was a commercial juggernaut, but they have since been deemed canonical by the heavy metal community. At War with Satan, a concept album about a war between heaven and hell (guess who wins), arrived in 1983, followed in 1985 by the more streamlined Possessed -- the title track managed to make its way onto the Parent Music Resource Center\\'s \"Filthy Fifteen\" list. Both albums flirted with mainstream success, but Venom\\'s frenetic take on the genre was being perfected by then-up-and-coming acts like Slayer, Megadeth, and Metallica, the latter of whom were opening for Venom just a few years earlier. Mantas left the group in the wake of 1986\\'s live Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, making way for guitarists Matt Hickey and Jimmy Clare, both of whom made their studio debut on 1987\\'s Calm Before the Storm. Lineup changes would continue to plague the band into the next decade, with Cronos opting out before the release of 1989\\'s Prime Evil, and taking Hickey and Clare with him to mount a solo career. The album featured a crew consisting of Abaddon, ex-Atomkraft vocalist/bassist Tony \"The Demolition Risk\" Dolan, guitarist Al Barnes, and a returning Mantas. This new version of Venom -- minus Barnes, who was replaced by guitarist Steve \"War Maniac\" White -- cranked out two more albums, Temples of Ice (1991) and The Waste Lands (1992), both of which disappeared below the radar, due in large part to the burgeoning grunge and alternative rock scenes. The trio of Mantas, Abaddon, and Dolan continued touring throughout the middle of the decade, although no new studio recordings were forthcoming. The return of Cronos in 1996 caused fans to rejoice and Dolan to bolt, and yielded 1997\\'s Cast in Stone, the first Venom album in 12 years to feature the original lineup -- the group\\'s full-length return to action was heralded by the release of the EP Venom \\'96. The reunion was short-lived, however, as after a world tour in support of the LP, Abaddon left the group. Cronos enlisted his brother Antony \"Antton\" Lant to get behind the kit on album number ten, 2000\\'s Resurrection. Antton would stay on for 2006\\'s Metal Black and 2008\\'s Hell, but the departure of Abbadon, along with a rotating cast of guitarists, left Cronos the sole remaining founding member of the group. To make things even more complicated, in 2014 Jeff \"Mantas\" Dunn, Tony \"Demolition Man\" Dolan, and Tony \"Abaddon\" Bray'\n",

      "'Originally a progressive rock group, Europe didn\\'t achieve success until they reworked their sound into bombastic yet melodic pop-metal. In their first incarnation, the Swedish band was called Force. Featuring core members Joey Tempest (vocals), John Norum (guitar), Tony Reno (drums), and John Leven (bass), the band won a national talent contest in the early \\'80s, which led to a record contract. After changing their name to Europe and releasing two albums in Sweden (Europe and Wings of Tomorrow), the band landed an international deal with Epic Records. By this time, Reno had left the group and been replaced by Ian Haugland. Keyboardist Mic Michaeli had also joined the lineup.In 1986, Europe released The Final Countdown. On the album, Michaeli\\'s keyboards take a prominent role (they provide the main riff in the hit title track), which nicely complemented the band\\'s smoother pop melodies. The change in style proved successful, as the record became a Top Ten hit in the U.S. and U.K.; both \"The Final Countdown\" and \"Carrie\" became Top Ten singles as well. Norum left the band by the end of the year and was replaced by Kee Marcello. Released in 1988, Out of This World continued the formula of the previous record. It was also a success, although its numbers didn\\'t match those of The Final Countdown. Three years later, Europe released their fifth studio album, Prisoners in Paradise, which featured the hit title track as well as the midtempo ballad \"I\\'ll Cry for You,\" before calling it quits the following year. The band, including Norum, reunited for a New Year\\'s Eve performance in Stockholm in 1999, resulting in the announcement of an official reunion three years later. The band subsequently recorded and released their sixth album, Start from the Dark (2004), then followed it with Secret Society (2006) and Last Look at Eden (2009), the latter of which debuted at number one on the Swedish album chart. Bag of Bones (2012) had a blues-rock feel, while War of Kings (2015) was a heavy, doomy, faintly psychedelic affair strongly inspired by their childhood heroes Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin.After embarking on a 30th anniversary tour dubbed The Final Countdown, the Swedish rockers returned in 2017 with a brand new album. Walk the Earth was produced by Dave Cobb (Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell, Dolly Parton) and recorded at London\\'s Abbey Road Studios. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Many point to Billy Squier as early-\\'80s rock personified -- an era when he and many of his peers tempered hard rock with pop melodicism -- and by adding just the right amount of posing and posturing for the newly constructed MTV set, he scored a string of arena rock anthems and power ballads. But Squier did not enjoy overnight success -- it took many years and several failed bands before he hit paydirt as a solo artist. Born on May 12, 1950, in Wellesley, Massachusetts, Squier began playing piano and guitar at an early age, but didn\\'t become serious with music until discovering Eric Clapton (via the renowned British guitarist\\'s stints with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers and Cream) in the late \\'60s and deciding to pursue music full-time. After playing in several local bands in the Boston area, Squier spent the early \\'70s moving back and forth between Boston and New York City, during which time he contributed to a troupe that combined music with poetry (called Magic Terry &amp; the Universe), attended the Berklee College of Music, and played in a pair of rock groups (N.Y.C.\\'s Kicks, which included future New York Dolls drummer Jerry Nolan, and Boston\\'s the Sidewinders). But it wasn\\'t until Squier\\'s next band, Piper, that the singer/guitarist fronted a group that inked a recording contract, issuing a pair of underappreciated albums for A&amp;M (1976\\'s self-titled debut and 1977\\'s Can\\'t Wait), before splitting up. Undeterred, Squier soldiered on as a solo act, issuing his solo debut, Tale of the Tape, in 1980, which spawned a moderate rock radio hit with \"You Should Be High Love,\" setting the stage perfectly for his big commercial breakthrough. Looking to the bombastic rock of early Led Zeppelin for inspiration, Squier\\'s sophomore release, Don\\'t Say No, became a monster hit on the strength of the Zep carbon copy \"The Stroke,\" as well as such other rock radio staples as \"In the Dark,\" \"My Kinda Lover,\" and \"Lonely Is the Night,\" all of which enjoyed heavy rotation on the newly founded MTV, helping Squier expand his audience even further. Squier\\'s hit parade continued with 1982\\'s Emotions in Motion, another big release that spawned an additional monster radio/MTV hit with \"Everybody Wants You.\" He supported the album with a tour of U.S. arenas (with an up-and-coming Def Leppard opening). But on his next release, the 1984 Jim Steinman-produced Signs of Life, Squier hit a snag in his career. Although the album was another sizeable U.S. hit, the video for the album\\'s single, \"Rock Me Tonite,\" alienated some of Squier\\'s hardcore rock following, as the singer was filmed flamboyantly prancing around his apartment in time to the music (and in a moment of great delight, ripping off his shirt) -- resulting in the clip often being considered one of the most inadvertently hilarious videos of all time.Squier continued to issue albums throughout the \\'80s (including such titles as 1986\\'s Enough Is Enough and 1989\\'s Hear &amp; Now), but it wasn\\'t enough to prevent his audience from moving on to such younger, similarly styled acts as Bon Jovi and Mötley Crüe, as the hits eventually dried up. Squier continued to release albums in the \\'90s (1991\\'s Creatures of Habit, 1993\\'s Tell the Truth, and 1998\\'s Happy Blue), but the hard rock audience, who became more interested in such unpretentious rockers as Nirvana, had deemed the majority of \\'80s rockers passé. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'Dave Grohl has voiced his appreciation of heavy metal numerous times over the years, whether it be trying to convince his Nirvana bandmates to have Sepultura open shows on the In Utero tour or playing with the Foo Fighters alongside Slayer, Pantera, and Black Sabbath at Ozzfest 1998 in the U.K.. But he was never so exuberant about his metal fixation until he issued the all-star project Probot in the early 21st century. As a teen growing up in Washington, D.C., during the early \\'80s, Grohl and a friend became interested in such (then) cult metal bands as Iron Maiden and Motörhead, before discovering a mail order ad for a record service named \"End of the Rainbow,\" which specialized in tracking down the newest releases from the metal underground. Looking for bands that were \"fast and heavy,\" the duo found their gold mine when they heard such classics as Metallica\\'s Kill \\'Em All and Mercyful Fate\\'s Melissa. From there, Grohl continued to hunt down further releases from the metal underground, which led to an appreciation for such groups as Trouble and Celtic Frost, even though he was playing in hardcore bands at the time. As just about any rock fan knows, Grohl spent the \\'90s playing with two of the decade\\'s most successful alternative rock acts, Nirvana and the Foo Fighters. And while both acts included elements of hard rock/metal in their sound, Grohl started to feel that he was becoming too closely linked to the more melodic side of rock. So when he came into some free time shortly after the dawn of the 21st century, he constructed a plan. Grohl began writing, playing (almost entirely himself), and recording an album\\'s worth of metal tunes that harked back to the sound of the aforementioned bands of the \\'80s. When it came to laying down vocals, Grohl came up with another idea -- instead of handling the vocal duties himself, he would get the singers from his favorite metal bands of yesteryear to lend a hand (as well as contribute lyrics). A fine plan, but hunting down some of these MIA chaps proved quite difficult -- at least before Grohl\\'s pal, former Chavez/Zwan guitarist Matt Sweeney, offered to lend a hand in the \"location\" department. Soon after, Grohl was receiving confirmations from the likes of Cronos from Venom, Snake from Voivod, Eric Wagner from Trouble, and Wino from Obsessed, as well as such more renowned names as Lemmy and King Diamond (with former Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil supplying some additional riffs to the project). Despite the project getting press coverage from the get-go, it took a few years to finally see the light of day, as record label red tape halted its release (as well as the simple fact that no major labels would commit to backing an album showcasing cult metal singers of the \\'80s). But Grohl eventually found a taker with the indie doom metal label Southern Lord, which issued the self-titled album (as a CD and double vinyl record) in February of 2003. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'Fashion trends may come and go, but Florida\\'s Iced Earth have remained steadfastly committed to championing the cause of heavy metal through thick and thin. After years of laboring in obscurity and undergoing countless lineup changes, they slowly emerged as one of the greatest hopes for classic metal in America. Originally formed in 1984 as the Rose and later Purgatory by guitarist Jon Schaffer, the band spent five years in a constant state of flux while paying their dues on the Florida live circuit. They slowly honed their sound by combining \\'80s thrash influences with the classic metal approach of Iron Maiden. Their 1988 Enter the Realm demo was an underground favorite, and after changing their name to Iced Earth, the band recorded their eponymous 1990 album with a lineup consisting of guitarists Schaffer and Randall Shawver, singer Gene Adams, bassist Dave Abell, and drummer Mike McGill. Further personnel changes saw the arrival of singer John Greely and drummer Richey Secchiari for 1991\\'s Night of the Stormrider, an ambitious concept album which nevertheless fell on deaf ears. Disheartened, Greely decided to call it quits, but Iced Earth would re-emerge three years later with 1995\\'s Burnt Offerings, released on Century Media Records and featuring vocalist Matthew Barlow and drummer Rodney Beasley. Constant touring saw Barlow prove himself the band\\'s first reliable singer, and Iced Earth hit their stride with the following year\\'s The Dark Saga. Despite the arrival of a new rhythm section (bassist Keith Menser and drummer Mark Prator), the album showcased the ever-improving consistency and quality of Schaffer and Shawver\\'s songwriting, as well as excellent cover artwork from Spawn comic book creator Todd MacFarlane. Iced Earth were so happy with that lineup that they returned to the studio in 1997 to re-record the best of their early material with Barlow on vocals, resulting in the appropriately titled Days of Purgatory collection. Schaffer also decided to relocate Iced Earth to Indiana for \"strategic reasons,\" prompting the departure of longtime cohort Shawver before the first sessions of 1998\\'s Something Wicked This Way Comes. The album repeated the successful formula of its predecessors, and with new guitarist Larry Tarnowski and new bassist James MacDonough in tow, the band embarked on their most ambitious world tour yet. Their performances in Greece (one of the band\\'s largest markets) yielded the double-album Alive in Athens, released in 1999. Horror Show appeared in summer 2001. They issued the covers album Tribute to the Gods in 2002. After endless touring and the departure of Barlow, former Judas Priest vocalist Tim \"Ripper\" Owens took over the lead vocal chair. The band released their sprawling double-disc concept recording Glorious Burden in 2004 to glowing reviews. In 2007, Iced Earth released two recordings: Framing Armageddon: Something Wicked, Pt. 1, and Overture of the Wicked EP. Following suit in 2008, they released Crucible of Man: Something Wicked, Pt. 2, and the EP I Walk Among You, followed by a world tour. In 2010, the SPV/Steamhammer imprint released the five-disc Box of the Wicked, which contained both parts of Something Wicked, and the accompanying two EPs, all on separate discs. The fifth disc contained bonus material: a re-recorded version of \"A Charge to Keep\" and live versions of \"Dark Saga,\" \"Iced Earth,\" and \"Pure Evil.\" The following year, Barlow announced his second departure from the band -- after rejoining in 2008 -- with Into Eternity\\'s Stu Block taking over vocal duties. In October the group issued their tenth studio album, Dystopia, and embarked on a hefty world tour, taking in some 133 dates. By 2012, bassist Freddie Vidales had stepped down, replaced by Fury UK\\'s Luke Appleton, and the group issued Live in Ancient Kourion, which had been recorded on the Dystopia tour in Cyprus. At the beginning of 2014 the band -- which now featured Jon Dette on drums -- released their 11th studio album, Plagues of Babylon. After a year away -- while Schaffer recovered from cervical fusion surgery -- the band announced they would start to write and record their 12th studio album. The resulting Incorruptible was issued in mid-2017. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'Sammy Hagar sang \"There\\'s Only One Way to Rock\" on Standing Hampton, the 1982 album that established him as a solo superstar nearly a decade after he made his recording debut as the lead singer of Montrose. The fact that Hagar was already in the second act of his career proved that the vocalist known as the Red Rocker figured out more than one way to rock and he\\'d continue to disprove his hit over the years, first finding superstardom as David Lee Roth\\'s replacement in Van Halen in 1986, then playing in a variety of good-time heavy rock bands after he parted ways with the group in 1996. Hagar returned to his solo career before forming the Waboritas, a group which in turn became the gateway for the supergroup Chickenfoot, which featured guitarist Joe Satriani and Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony. The latter proved to be an enduring creative partner for Sammy, appearing in Sammy Hagar and the Circle, the outfit that brought the singer into the 2020s, playing rousing rock &amp; roll with a vigor reminiscent of Standing Hampton but sounding bigger and brawnier, proving that the singer has found many ways to rock over the course of a long career.After giving up a boxing career, Hagar began singing in the late \\'60s, performing with various California bands including Skinny, the Fabulous Catillas, Justice Brothers, and Dust Cloud. During this time, he built up a solid reputation in the California hard rock scene. Former Edgar Winter guitarist Ronnie Montrose asked Hagar to join his band, Montrose, in 1973. Hagar recorded two albums with Montrose before going solo in 1976, taking the group\\'s bassist, Bill Church, with him. Montrose\\'s drummer Denny Carmassi later joined Hagar\\'s band, along with keyboardist Geoff Workman. Hagar\\'s self-titled \"red album\" was his first chart entry; it eventually went gold. In 1979, he created a new supporting band featuring Workman, Church, guitarist Gary Pihl, and drummer Chuck Ruff. This lineup played on Hagar\\'s most popular solo album, 1981\\'s platinum Standing Hampton, plus 1982\\'s gold Three Lock Box with only one member missing -- drummer Ruff was replaced by David Lauser. After Three Lock Box and its number 13 hit single \"Your Love Is Driving Me Crazy,\" Hagar played several shows with guitarist Neal Schon, bassist Kenny Aaronson, and drummer Mike Shrieve; the group recorded a live album under the name Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve (HSAS), as well as a studio version of Procol Harum\\'s \"A Whiter Shade of Pale.\" His 1984 album VOA contained the hit single \"I Can\\'t Drive 55,\" which peaked at number 26.In 1985, Hagar replaced David Lee Roth in Van Halen; his first album with the group was 1986\\'s 5150. Hagar released his last solo album in 1987; the record was coined I Never Said Goodbye in an MTV contest. Hagar stayed with Van Halen throughout the remainder of the \\'80s and half of the \\'90s. During that time, the band had four other multi-platinum albums -- OU812 (1988), For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge (1991), Live: Right Here, Right Now (1993), and Balance (1995) -- before tensions began to surface between Hagar and the rest of the band. In the summer of 1996, Hagar either quit Van Halen or was fired; the band had Roth return to sing two tracks on Best of Van Halen, Vol. 1 before hiring former Extreme vocalist Gary Cherone as Hagar\\'s replacement. The entire incident became a media sensation, ensuring that Hagar\\'s 1997 solo album Marching to Mars -- his first in ten years -- would be greeted with much media-generated fanfare. It sold surprisingly well, peaking in the Top 20 and re-establishing Hagar as a viable solo act. With a backing band called the Waboritas in tow (consisting of guitarist Vic Johnson, keyboardist Jesse Harms, bassist Mona, and drummer David Lauser), Hagar followed the success with Red Voodoo two years later; it too sold very respectably on the strength of the single \"Mas Tequila,\" just missing the Top 20. Hagar\\'s resurgence continued with 2000\\'s Ten 13. Not 4 Sale arrived in 2003, followed by his first live album in 20 years, Live: Hallelujah. Livin\\' It Up! was released in 2006, while VOA was reissued the following year in deluxe format, courtesy of the newly launched American Beat Records. In 2008, Hagar released Cosmic Universal Fashion, his 11th solo album and first for Roadrunner imprint Loud &amp; Proud Records. That same year, he debuted a new band, Chickenfoot, after jamming with Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony, guitarist Joe Satriani, and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. The supergroup released its self-titled debut album in 2009. The debut went gold, which was good enough to guarantee a 2011 sequel called Chickenfoot III (despite its joking title, this was indeed their sophomore set). Hagar didn\\'t abandon his Chickenfoot brothers for the 2013 album Sammy Hagar &amp; Friends; each member, along with several other kindred spirits, showed up on this party-hearty 2013 LP. 2014\\'s Lite Roast saw the tireless Hagar and Wabos guitarist Vic Johnson gently tearing through some coffeehouse-ready versions of Hagar classics, while 2015 saw the release of the live album At Your Service, the first album to be released under the moniker Sammy Hagar &amp; the Circle, his newest touring incarnation featuring Michael Anthony on bass, drummer Jason Bonham and guitarist Vic Johnson. The Circle released their first studio album, The Space Between, in 2019; it debuted at number four upon its release. The group returned in 2022 with Crazy Times, which featured a cover of Elvis Costello\\'s \"Pump It Up\" as its first single. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'A blues-based hard rock band marked by clever songwriting and technical acumen, Tesla rose to fame during the pop-metal boom of the 1980s and early \\'90s. The band\\'s music is equally indebted to contemporary blues and \\'70s-style hard rock, a fusion that helped differentiate platinum-selling albums like Mechanical Resonance (1986), The Great Radio Controversy (1989), and Psychotic Supper (1991) from their contemporaries. Despite the refreshing lack of posturing, Tesla was hit just as hard as the rest of the metal world when grunge arrived in the early \\'90s, resulting in a six-year hiatus before reuniting in the 2000s. Since then, the band has remained active, touring, and issuing studio albums like Forever More (2008), Simplicity (2014), and Shock (2019) that combine no-frills classic rock with bluesy pop-metal. Although Tesla took shape in 1985 in Sacramento, California, the musicians (vocalist Jeff Keith, the underrated guitar tandem of Frank Hannon and Tommy Skeoch, bassist Brian Wheat, and drummer Troy Luccketta) had logged several years together under the name City Kidd. At their management\\'s suggestion, they renamed their group after the eccentric inventor Nikola Tesla, who pioneered the radio but was given only belated credit for doing so. After playing several showcases in Los Angeles, Tesla quickly scored a deal with Geffen and released the debut album Mechanical Resonance in 1986. It produced a minor hard rock hit in \"Modern Day Cowboy,\" reached the Top 40 on the album charts, and eventually went platinum. However, it was their 1989 follow-up effort, The Great Radio Controversy, that truly broke the band. The first single, \"Heaven\\'s Trail (No Way Out),\" was another hit with hard rock audiences and set the stage for a second single, a warm, comforting ballad named \"Love Song\" that substituted a dash of hippie utopianism for the usual power ballad histrionics. \"Love Song\" hit the pop Top Ten and pushed The Great Radio Controversy into the Top 20. Double-platinum sales figures followed as another single, \"The Way It Is,\" also enjoyed some degree of airplay. In keeping with their unpretentious, blue-collar roots, Tesla responded to stardom not by aping the glam theatrics of their tourmates, but by stripping things down. The idea behind 1990\\'s Five Man Acoustical Jam was virtually unheard of -- a pop-metal band playing loose, informal acoustic versions of their best-known songs in concert, plus a few favorite covers (\\'60s classics by the Beatles, Stones, CCR, and others). Fortunately, Tesla\\'s music was sturdy enough to hold up when its roots were exposed, and one of the covers -- \"Signs,\" an idealistic bit of hippie outrage by the Five Man Electrical Band -- became another Top Ten hit, as well as the band\\'s highest-charting single. Not only did Five Man Acoustical Jam reach the Top 20 and go platinum, but it also helped directly inspire MTV\\'s Unplugged series, both with its relaxed vibe and its reminder that acoustic music could sound vital and energetic. The studio follow-up to The Great Radio Controversy, Psychotic Supper, arrived in 1991 and quickly became another platinum hit. It didn\\'t produce any singles quite as successful as \"Love Song\" or \"Signs,\" but it did spin off the greatest number of singles of any Tesla album: \"Edison\\'s Medicine,\" \"Call It What You Want,\" \"What You Give,\" and \"Song and Emotion.\" Perhaps that was partly due to Tesla\\'s workmanlike hard rock, which didn\\'t sound ridiculous if it was played on rock radio alongside the new crop of Seattle bands. The winds of change were blowing, though, and by the time Tesla returned with their 1994 follow-up, Bust a Nut, few bands from the pop-metal era had maintained their popularity. Bust a Nut did sell over 800,000 copies -- an extremely respectable showing given the musical climate of 1994, and a testament to the fan base Tesla had managed to cultivate over the years. Yet all was not well within the band, and Tommy Skeoch\\'s addiction to tranquilizers resulted in his dismissal from the band in 1995. Tesla attempted to forge ahead as a quartet, but the chemistry had been irreparably altered by Skeoch\\'s exit, and they broke up in 1996. Most of the bandmembers began playing with smaller outfits, none of which moved beyond a local level. When Skeoch\\'s health improved, however, the band staged a small-scale reunion in 2000, which quickly became a full-fledged effort. In the fall of 2001, the group released a two-disc live album, Replugged Live, which documented their reunion tour. Into the Now, which was co-produced by Michael Rosen (Testament, AFI), appeared in March 2004. A collection of \\'70s covers called Real to Reel arrived in 2007, by which time Skeoch had left the band once more and been replaced by Dave Rude. 2008 found the revised band releasing its seventh studio album, Forever More, an all-new collection of songs that saw the musicians reuniting with producer Terry Thomas, who had previously helmed 1994\\'s Bust a Nut.Simplicity, the band\\'s seventh long-player, appeared in 2014. Between tour dates in the spring of 2017, Tesla teamed with producer Phil Collen. Together they spent two years working on a studio album. In March 2019, the full-length Shock was released by Universal, marking their return to a major label. The following year saw the release of the concert LP Five Man London Jam, which was recorded during an intimate performance at Abbey Road Studios. The title is a tip of the hat to 1990\\'s chart-topping Five Man Acoustical Jam. 2021 saw the release of the standalone single, \"Cold Blue Steel,\" with the party-starting \"Time to Rock!\" appearing in 2022. ~ Steve Huey &amp; Andrew Leahey, Rovi'\n",

      "'Vocalist Phil Mogg, guitarist Mick Bolton, bassist Pete Way, and drummer Andy Parker formed the British space metal outfit UFO in 1969. Originally known as Hocus Pocus, the group, which took the name UFO in honor of a London club, debuted in 1971 with UFO 1. Both the album and its follow-up, the same year\\'s Flying, found great success in Japan, France, and Germany, but was barely noticed in the band\\'s native country; as a result, their third effort, 1972\\'s Live, was released only in Japan.In 1974, Bolton left the group; after brief trial runs with ex-Pink Fairies guitarist Larry Wallis and future Whitesnake member Bernie Marsden, former Scorpion Michael Schenker stepped in as a permanent replacement in time to record 1974\\'s Phenomenon, which sported a harder-edged guitar sound. After 1975\\'s Force It and 1976\\'s No Heavy Petting brought UFO increased visibility with American audiences, keyboardist Paul Raymond joined for 1977\\'s Lights Out. However, after 1978\\'s Obsession, Schenker left the group, first to rejoin the Scorpions and later to form his own band. Despite the addition of guitarist Paul Chapman, the next UFO LP, No Place to Run, failed to match the success of its predecessors.In 1982, the band released Mechanix, notching a minor U.S. hit with \"Back into My Life\"; later that year, Way exited to form Waysted and was replaced by ex-Eddie &amp; the Hot Rods bassist Paul Gray. After 1983\\'s Making Contact, UFO dissolved, only to re-form two years later for Misdemeanor; however, the album was met with little response, and they again called it quits. In 1993, the group\\'s most popular lineup -- Mogg, Schenker, Way, Raymond, and Parker -- reunited and recorded the 1995 album Walk on Water; after a tour, the members yet again went their separate ways. Mogg and Way continued to work as Mogg/Way and released the albums Edge of the World (1997) and Chocolate Box (1999). Schenker rejoined in 2000 along with veteran drummer Aynsley Dunbar for the two-CD Covenant, which featured one disc of new studio recordings along with one disc of live recordings. Sharks came out in 2002; Schenker and Dunbar departed and were replaced by Vinnie Moore and Jason Bonham, respectively.

Bonham was the next to leave and was replaced by the band\\'s original drummer, Andy Parker, for 2006\\'s The Monkey Puzzle.

      "'Scottish hard rockers Nazareth dominated the airwaves in the late \\'70s with the biting rock anthem \"Hair of the Dog\" and the enduring proto-power ballad \"Love Hurts.\" Emerging in 1971, the band found mainstream success in 1975 with the release of their platinum-selling fifth album, Hair of the Dog. Despite numerous lineup changes, the group remained prolific and popular in Europe throughout the \\'80s and \\'90s, and continued to tour and record into the 2000s, with bassist and co-founder Pete Agnew serving as the sole constant member. In 2018, Nazareth celebrated its 50th Anniversary with the release of Tattooed on My Brain. Surviving the Law, the band\\'s 25th studio album, appeared in 2022. Formed in Dunfermline in 1968, Nazareth\\'s initial lineup featured vocalist Dan McCafferty, guitarist Manny Charlton, bassist Pete Agnew, and drummer Darrell Sweet. The band had relocated to London by 1970, and they released their self-titled debut album in 1971. Both Nazareth and 1972\\'s Exercises received favorable attention by British hard rockers, but it was 1973\\'s Razamanaz that moved them into the U.K. Top Ten (both \"Broken Down Angel\" and \"Bad Bad Boy\" were hit singles). Loud \\'n\\' Proud and Rampant (both 1974) followed the same formula, yet were slightly less successful.Released the following year, Hair of the Dog established Nazareth as an internationally popular hard rock band. Featuring their revamped version of the Everly Brothers\\' \"Love Hurts,\" the album sold over a million copies in the U.S. Until the end of the \\'70s, the band continued successfully as a quartet, releasing a series of Top 100 albums. In 1979, they added former Sensational Alex Harvey Band guitarist Zal Cleminson to their lineup; he left after recording two albums -- 1979\\'s No Mean City and 1980\\'s Malice in Wonderland -- and was replaced by former Spirit keyboardist John Locke. Following the 1981 live album \\'Snaz, guitarist Bill Rankin also joined the group; Locke left soon after his addition and Rankin switched to keyboards.By this time, their commercial appeal had dwindled in both the U.K. and the U.S. By the mid-\\'80s, Nazareth was left without a record contract, so the band went on hiatus for a few years. They returned in 1992 with No Jive, which charted in Australia and Switzerland. Guitarist Jimmy Murrison joined the band after the release of 1994\\'s Move Me. In 1999, Nazareth resurfaced yet again with Boogaloo. While touring the album, original drummer Darrell Sweet passed away at the age of 51 from a heart attack; bassist Agnew\\'s son Lee took over drum duties. After a ten-year break, the band returned with their 21st studio album, 2008\\'s The Newz, which was released in congruence with the band\\'s 40th anniversary. 2011 saw the release of the bluesy Big Dogz, followed by Rock \\'n\\' Roll Telephone in 2014. Citing ill health, longtime vocalist Dan McCafferty left the band shortly before the album\\'s release. With the retired singer\\'s blessing, Linton Osborne was chosen as McCafferty\\'s replacement. Osborne departed ahead of the band\\'s next studio effort, and was replaced by Carl Sentance (ex-Krokus, Persian Risk, Geezer Butler Band). Sentance made his debut on 2018\\'s Tattooed on My Brain, which coincided with the band\\'s 50th anniversary. That same lineup of Sentance, Pete Agnew, Jimmy Murrison, and Lee Agnew reconvened for 2022\\'s Frontiers-issued Surviving the Law, their 25th long-player. Founding guitarist Manny Charlton died on July 5, 2022 at the age of 80. Long-time vocalist Dan McCafferty died on November 8, 2022 at the age of 76. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "'Velvet Revolver began with a spring 2002 jam session that reunited ex-Guns N\\' Roses bandmates Slash (guitar), Duff McKagan (bass), and Matt Sorum (drums) on-stage. With the discovery that their chemistry was still going strong, the trio began pushing around some new music and auditioning singers for what became known as \"the Project.\" Early entries included ex-Buckcherry shouter Josh Todd and Neurotica\\'s Kelly Shaefer; both became acquainted with the cutting room floor. By early 2003, the existence of \"the Project\" -- and its quest for a singer -- was common knowledge, so much so that VH1 sent cameras to document the search. Dave Kushner (Wasted Youth, Dave Navarro) also joined up as second guitarist. Troubled STP-er Scott Weiland came on board next. He and the band clicked immediately and recorded a hyper piece of glitter metal for the Hulk soundtrack called \"Set Me Free.\" By June, \"the Project\" had been renamed Velvet Revolver, and Weiland was officially made its lead singer, though possession charges stemming from a May bust were still outstanding. The band signed a deal with RCA and spent the rest of 2003 fitting in gigs and recording sessions around Weiland\\'s court-ordered rehab. RCA next announced an April 2004 release for Contraband, Velvet Revolver\\'s full-length debut; the date was then pushed to May, and finally to June. That spring, Weiland labored through court dates and recovery as Slash and Duff did advance press for Contraband, and fan anticipation for the album grew. VR also released the single \"Slither,\" a rabid, ambitious rocker guided by Slash\\'s signature guitar sound. The single sidled steadily up the active rock charts, and when Contraband finally dropped, it was to general appreciation for its mix of STP and GNR signatures and its surprising turn toward hedonistic maturity. Velvet Revolver\\'s sophomore effort, Libertad, followed in 2007. In December 2015, Weiland was found dead in Bloomington, Minnesota, while on tour with his then-band, the Wildabouts. ~ Johnny Loftus, Rovi'\n",

Tribbett) (guitar), and Kud (Chad Gray) (vocals). The group's original bassist was replaced after two years by Ryknow (Ryan Martinie). During their development, the bandmembers began the practice of applying bizarre makeup. After self-releasing their first album, Kill, I Oughta, they were signed by Epic Records and recorded their major-label debut, L.D. 50, which was released in August 2000 shortly after the end of their first national tour opening for Slipknot. The album later went gold and earned Mudvayne the first-ever MTV2 Video Award at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. Mudvayne continued touring and reissued their self-released debut EP, Kill, I Oughta, in November 2001 as The Beginning of All Things to End. A year later the band returned with its official follow-up, The End of All Things to Come, which was recorded at Minneapolis' Pachyderm Studios with Tool producer David Bottrill. With a new album came new personas, this time as space aliens. The bandmembers changed their names accordingly, taking the new monikers of Chüd (Kud), Güüg (Gurrg), R-üD (Ryknow), and Spüg (sPaG). They embarked on a European tour, arriving back stateside in July to join the Summer Sanitarium shed tour, featuring such heavyweights as Metallica and Linkin Park. In 2005, the band released Lost and Found, their third album for Epic. In September 2007, Mudvayne announced they would allow fans to vote on the band's website to determine the track selection for the compilation By the People, for the People, released the following month.

      "'Drowning Pool is an alternative/nu-metal band that combines muscular drums, angry riffs, and dark themes. The group found mainstream success in 2001 with the release of their platinum-selling debut album, Sinner, which included the hit single \"Bodies.\" After the death of vocalist Dave Williams in 2002, Drowning Pool relied on a rotating cast of lead singers (Jason Jones, Ryan McCombs, and Jasen Moreno) to deliver hard-hitting efforts like Full Circle (2007), Resilience (2013), and Strike a Nerve (2022). Founded in 1996, Drowning Pool represented the vision of drummer Mike Luce and guitarist C.J. Pierce, who formed the band after relocating from New Orleans to Dallas and hooking up with bassist Stevie Benton. Although they initially performed as an instrumental trio, their sound coalesced with the arrival of Dave \"Stage\" Williams as vocalist. Drowning Pool experienced success from the outset. When a copy of their first demo reached members of Sevendust, they were invited to tour with the industrial metal group. Tours with Kittie and (hed) p.e. followed. Their second demo, recorded after two years on the road, reached the Top Ten on Dallas radio station KEGL and led to a contract with the Wind-Up Records label. Produced by Jay Baumgardner (Papa Roach, Godsmack, Coal Chamber), their first album, Sinner, became an instant hit. It was certified platinum within six weeks of its release, while their first single, \"Bodies,\" was one of the most frequently aired videos on MTV for a new band. They reached out to an even greater audience with dynamic performances at Wrestlemania XVIII and Ozzfest during the summers of 2001 and 2002. Unfortunately, their streak of success was not to last. Shortly after rousing the crowd at Ozzfest in Indianapolis, Indiana, on August 3, 2002, Williams was found dead of natural causes on the tour bus. In the wake of that tragedy, the band forged ahead. A concert film, Sinema, featuring more than two-and-a-half hours of footage, was released in late 2002. In January 2004, the band announced the addition of singer Jason \"Gong\" Jones, and their sophomore effort, Desensitized, followed several months later. In 2006, former Soil singer Ryan McCombs assumed the vocal duties, and a year later they released Full Circle, which was followed by live album, Loudest Common Denominator, in 2009. A self-titled album dropped in 2010, making McCombs the first DP singer to record more than one album with the group. However, it was not to last: he departed the following year, and was replaced by Suicide Hook vocalist Jasen Moreno, who made his official debut on 2013\\'s Resilience. Three years later, Moreno would match McCombs\\' record with the announcement of the second Moreno-led and sixth overall Drowning Pool album, Hellelujah. Produced by Jason Suecof (Deicide, Motionless in White), the release featured the uncompromising single \"By the Blood.\" Originally slated for release in 2020, the band\\'s seventh long-player, Strike a Nerve, was pushed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Billed as their heaviest effort to date, the 11-song set saw the band digging hard into their blue-collar Southern metal roots. ~ Craig Harris &amp; Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Fear: humanity's great divider, but also its most potent unifier. It's this very notion that lies at the beating core of Polaris's third album Fatalism; a record shaped by the sense of despair and dystopia that engulfed the world over the past few years, and the overwhelming accompanying sensation that we were powerless to change course. Equally steeped in angst and catharsis, an expanded thematic gaze and heavier sonic terrain, Fatalism organically builds on the bleak imagery and hard-hitting soundscapes permeating Polaris's ARIA Award-nominated 2020 release The Death of Me, galvanizing the Sydney five-piece's trademark blend of melodic metalcore, lush post rock, electronic flourishes and beyond. Across 11 tracks, Fatalism wields emphatic relatability and explosive arrangements, from its atmospheric, doom-laden opener Harbinger to the foreboding anthem Nightmare and the pummeling delights of The Crossfire, both dealing in elasticated riffs and the coruscating vocals of Jamie Hails. As a whole, Fatalism casts its gaze more outwardly than its 2020 predecessor The Death Of Me, by contrast a largely introspective record. And while strictly not a pandemic album, it was impossible not to be impacted and influenced by the events surrounding its making. The result is an album that combines Polaris's trademark melange of ferocity and melody with new sonic twists and a lyrical focus that, while far from easy listening, is as cathartic for the listener as it is the group.\"\n",

They hit their stride in 2012 with the release of their third full-length effort, Chasing Ghosts, which like subsequent outings This Could Be Heartbreak (2016), Everyone Loves You... Once You Leave Them (2020), and Not Without My Ghosts (2023), soared to the top of the Australian charts, and found international success as well. Brisbane post-hardcore act the Amity Affliction were formed in 2002 by Ahren Stringer and Troy Brady, a pair of longtime pals -- still high schoolers at the time -- who had been affected by the death of their friend in a road accident. The band -- a quartet rounded out by bassist Garth Buchanan and drummer Lachlan Faulkner -- released a demo in 2003 and an EP in 2004 but didn't start making waves in earnest until sometime later. In 2005, after unclean vocalist Joel Birch joined the fold, Amity Affliction went on a touring spell, working up a nationwide reputation as a powerful live band. In 2007, they added keyboard player Trad Nathan, switched drummers with Ryan Burt replacing Faulkner, and parted ways with Buchanan, with Stringer taking on bass duties. The newly formed group then hit the studio to record the EP High Hopes, followed in 2008 by the debut album Severed Ties, which peaked at number 26 on the ARIA charts. Amity Affliction toured Australia again in 2008 and 2009, both as a support and headlining act, and in 2010 they released their second album, Youngbloods, which confirmed that their efforts paid off, reaching number six on the ARIA charts. They would top that achievement just two years later when their third album, Chasing Ghosts, debuted at number one on the ARIA charts. A fourth album, Let the Ocean Take Me, arrived on Roadrunner in 2014 and was the band's second consecutive ARIA chart-topper. That year, Brady left the band, leaving Stringer as the only founding member. After months of touring Ocean, the quartet returned to the studio to record their fifth LP. This Could Be Heartbreak arrived in August 2016, topping the ARIA charts once again. The band toured Australia, the U.S., and Europe in support of the record, before Ryan Burt left in February 2018 owing to mental health concerns. Later that year, the Amity Affliction released their sixth album, Misery. Their first concept effort, it featured an overarching narrative chronicling the tale of three friends on a dark quest for vengeance. Two years later the band returned with weighty and depressive Everyone Loves You... Once You Leave Them, their first studio LP with new drummer Joe Longobardi. 2023's pummeling Not Without My Ghosts followed an over-arching theme of mortality and featured guest spots from late New Zealand rapper Louie Knuxx, Comeback Kid's Andrew Neufeld, the Plot in You's Landon Tewers, and Phem. ~ Alexey Eremenko &amp; Neil Z.

The two-time GRAMMY Award-nominated Pennsylvania quintet—JB Brubaker [lead guitar], Brent Rambler [rhythm guitar], Matt Greiner [drums], Jake Luhrs [lead vocals], and Dustin Davidson [bass]—have preserved this level of integrity since first emerging in 2003. Following the seminal Messengers [2007] and Constellations [2009], the band infiltrated the mainstream via 2015's Found In Far Away Places. Not only did the latter stand out as their second straight #9 bow on the Billboard Top 200, but it also garnered the group's first GRAMMY Award nomination in the category of “Best Metal Performance” for “Identity.” The momentum increased with the arrival of Phantom Anthem in 2017. Marking the group's fourth Top 20 debut on the Billboard Top 200, it paved the way for their second “Best Metal Performance” GRAMMY nod for “Invisible Enemy.” Between sold-out shows worldwide, they continued a 15-year tradition of holiday shows by launching the Christmas Burns Red Festival. Now, their 2020 eighth full-length, Guardians [Fearless Records], sees them not only preserve but perfect this definitive sound as evidenced by the likes of “Defender” and “Bones.”\"\n",

The release of their tenth studio album, Misery Made Me, finds the group spring boarding off the heights they've reached over the past handful of years; their latest album (2020's A Beautiful Place To Drown) adding 80 Million streams to a mind-numbing career total of 500 Million. Inspired by the past two years, Misery Made Me is a depiction of Silverstein – and world at large's – collective turmoil, frustration, and anxiety.  “I wanted to explore the meaning of ‘Misery' as a main theme throughout the album,” says vocalist Shane Told. “Despite the mountains climbed and boulders pushed during recent years, we were confronted by the weight and misery of staying relatively in the same place for a long period of time. Finding peace in the reality of this misery became important. The record is about the acceptance of a new reality and adapting to it.” It's both intriguing and inspiring that a band – who could have merely rested on the impressive legacy they've already cemented – would continue to dig deep and find the inspiration to reach people in meaningful new ways. Misery Made Me is a campaign hinged on Silverstein's reflection and gratitude for their roots, their honouring of their earliest fans, and their staunch desire to explore forward-thinking and adventurous ways to connect with new ones.

Named “Album of the Week” by Revolver, it yielded the signature anthem “Bloodlust,” which clocked over 2.6 million views and nearly 2 million streams. In 2016, they reached another level with Isolation, earning acclaim from outlets such as New Noise Magazine and generating millions of views between “Dragon” and “Disconnect.” However, the group's fourth full-length album, Geist, fully represents the actualization of the sound McBee envisioned nearly a decade before.“My goal for The Browning is to be industrial-electronic-rock-metal, For this new album, I knew there needed to be a massive change. That change had to come from the vocals. I've been working on finding the right voice for three years that's powerful and melodic, but still heavy. It was a long process, I documented most of it live on my Twitch channel.” As McBee faced myriad personal trials and tribulations, he simultaneously wrote countless songs and streamed the creative process on Twitch.

      "'Peterborough, Canada hard rock trio Thousand Foot Krutch made their debut in 1995 when Trevor McNevan, Joel Bruyere, and Steve Augustine started putting a praise &amp; worship spin on the nu-metal sound of the time. After building a buzz around Ontario with numerous shows and a strong demo titled That\\'s What People Do, Thousand Foot Krutch signed with Diamante and issued their debut LP, Set It Off, in 2000. The album featured a cover of EMF\\'s \"Unbelievable\" on a set that veered toward the sounds of P.O.D. and Papa Roach. TFK signed with Tooth &amp; Nail for September 2003\\'s Phenomenon. They\\'d developed considerably in the two years since Set It Off, and the new album reflected a more focused rock sound, much like Chevelle or Finger Eleven. During this era, McNevan and Augustine also formed a pop-punk side band dubbed FM Static. Released in 2005, The Art of Breaking adopted an even heavier rock sound, doubling down on the introspection, angst, and emotion. Produced by Arnold Lanni (Our Lady Peace, Finger Eleven), it was the band\\'s first album to break into the Billboard 200 (at number 67). From there, the band would continue to rise in the charts. In 2007, they released their fifth full-length, The Flame in All of Us, which was produced by Ken Andrews (Beck, Chris Cornell, Pete Yorn). Arriving in 2009, the aggressive Welcome to the Masquerade, which would be the band\\'s last release with Tooth &amp; Nail, entered the Billboard Top 200 at number 35, peaking at number two on the Christian rock chart. It was their most successful album to date and would spawn the band\\'s first live album, Live at the Masquerade. The group\\'s next studio album, The End Is Where We Begin, was issued in 2012. It was their first album released entirely independently. Continuing the upward chart trajectory with each subsequent release, The End debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, and claimed the top spots on both the hard rock and Christian charts. In late 2013, the band released Made in Canada: The 1998-2010 Collection, which included two new tracks. Thousand Foot Krutch remained independent into 2014, relying on crowd-sourcing for the release of the energetic Oxygen: Inhale, the first part of a pair of hard rock chart-topping LPs. The heavier Exhale followed in 2016, marking TFK\\'s third consecutive Christian number one. ~ Johnny Loftus &amp; Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'\n",

The very first single with him became by far the biggest hit in the band\\'s history: \"Hypa Hypa\" reached over 60 million plays in record time! The two following singles \"We Got The Moves\" and \"Pump It\", featured on the new album \"TEKKNO\", are also the talk of the world with their spectacularly funny videos.

So there is a guest feature of rapper FiNCH on the hit single \"Spaceman\", the song \"Fuckboi\" was created with the participation of the female post-hardcore band Conquer Divide and on the latest single \"Hurrikan\" the clichés of Ballermann Schlager are smugly made fun of, until the zombie apocalypse with a deathcore carnage answers any questions unmistakably.

Rather, the band—completed today by founding member and drummer Jake Smelley, vocalist Daniel McWhorter, guitarist/vocalist Tyler Riley and bassist Caleb DeRusha—kept stretching the boundaries of their sound to great acclaim and to increasing commercial success. 2011's debut album, Costs, established them as powerhouse of the metalcore scene, but that's something the band simultaneously pushed away from it, incorporating elements of melodic hardcore and hardcore punk into the fold of their songs, but always with an underlying sense of positivity and defiance.

Balancing their tenacity with sincerity, \"It\\'s this feeling of never being enough is what drives us forward right now,” vocalist Niko Vilhelm says. When forming back in 2013 in the city of Oulu, way up in the North of Finland, vocalists Niko and Joel Hokka, drummer Tommi Lalli, guitarist Joonas Porko and bass player Olli Matela, plus the later addition of DJ/Percussionist Aleksi Kaunisvesi - knew that it was all about going big or going home. When they were told to sing in their native tongue, they refused. It was simply never an option. The doors that closed only made them want to grab an axe to break through, The Shining style, to properly make themselves known. This is exactly what they did when they found their way onto the largest stage in Europe: Eurovision, after competing in the Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu (UMK), Finland\\'s annual contest to discover their entry. Winning the spot, by the largest landslide the competition has seen, Blind Channel captured and enamoured the continent with the fiery nu-metal charge of ‘Dark Side\\'. Be warned however, Eurovision isn\\'t the crux of Blind Channel\\'s story. This stepping stone that saw them take to that hallowed stage, was just that, a gambit towards the bigger picture.MANAGEMENTBackbone Managementantti (at) backbonemanagement (dot) fi'\n",

For UNEARTH's founding mainstays, Phipps and guitarist Buz McGrath, it feels like the beginning of a new chapter. “Buz took the entire pandemic to write these songs,” says Trevor. “He pushed himself to get out of his comfort zone and explore what UNEARTH is, both past and present.

Downtempo, slamming and now blackened variants of the style have dominated its scene at various points, with many bands jumping ship.Pittsburgh's Signs of the Swarm aren't just any band, though. They're a once-a-generation beacon that radiates the sounds that surrounded them, preserving history by reframing it. On fourth LP Absolvere, they're bleak without being blackened, smashing without being slam, and downtempo as a choice rather than a stylistic confine. And as many of their deathcore peers experiment with adding singing, often gruff in tone, they add a more ethereal style that soothes on “Dreaming Desecration” and “Death Whistle.”The band contrasts that with some of the most brutal moments in their eight-year career, with riffs more punishing than pensive and a rhythm section that frames them in creatively cacophonic ways. Above it all, they're utilizing vocalist David Simonich monstrous range in a much fuller capacity than on his debut, 2019's Vital Deprivation. That transitional album found the band experimenting to re-find their footing, which here lands on solid ground through the addition of guitarist Jeff Russo, a former bandmate of Simonich's fin Improvidence. The proof is in the placing, with Absolvere landing at #15 on “Current Hard Music Albums,” #21 on “Top New Artist Albums” and #139 on “Heatseekers.” …~ via Bradley Zorgdrager\"\n",

Less burn down a church and more take down religion as a whole.

So intense was Carcosa's devotion to death that the body was still warm when they started.Their June 2020 unveiling and release of the 'Absent' EP 2 months later took them from disregard of to mastery over death.Carcosa stare into the abyss—knowing everything happens in cycles but with the nihilistic knowledge everything ends. Their name, as well as the black, yellow and spiral-laden imagery, were inspired by 'True Detective.'One could argue their lyrics and sound came from the hopeless mind of Rust Cohle.

Across a handful of split EPs and other releases, including two full-length albums, the North Vancouver six-piece make their musical intentions clear. AngelMaker creates deathcore of the highest order, injected with blackened thrash, a smattering of power violence, and the urgent ferocity of underground hardcore. Like genre standard-bearers Black Dahlia Murder, Despised Icon, and Whitechapel, AngelMaker summon the most brutal elements of death metal and combine it with the coldest permafrost of black metal, without the theatricality sometimes clouding the genres. The brand-new music unleashed by AngelMaker in 2021, crafted in recent months with producer Tim Creviston (Spiritbox, Misery Signals), and mixed and mastered by Will Putney (Thy Art Is Murder, Knocked Loose), is the band's most confident and destructive yet. The band's dual-vocal and triple-guitar composition allows for new and diverse explorations of extremity, setting AngelMaker both inside and apart from the traditions of the deathcore subgenre. Beyond mere technicality and devastation, AngelMaker trade in emotion, eliciting unique feelings of sorrow, regret, anger, fear, and depression, taking listeners on immersive journeys within the songs.

      "\"Phoenix death/thrash metal act Cavalera Conspiracy, which also operates under the moniker Cavalera, was formed in 2007 by Brazilian metal legends and siblings Max Cavalera (vocals and guitar) and Igor Cavalera (drums), formerly of Sepultura. The group's sound reflects the punitive, blackened thrash of the brothers' flagship band, with added hardcore punk and groove metal elements. Between 2008 and 2017, Cavalera Conspiracy issued four studio albums (Inflikted, Blunt Force Trauma, Pandemonium, and Psychosis) before shortening their name ahead of the release of 2023's re-recording of Sepultura's 1986 debut, Morbid Visions. The formation of Cavalera Conspiracy marked the conclusion of a ten-year feud between the Cavalera brothers, who co-founded Sepultura in their native Brazil in 1984. Rounded out by guitarist Marc Rizzo (Soulfly) and bassist Joe Duplantier (Gojira), the band's debut for Roadrunner Records, Inflikted, arrived on March 25, 2008. Cavalera Conspiracy took a brief break as Max (Soulfly) and Igor (Nailbomb, Strife) returned to their respective bands, but they regrouped in 2009 for a European tour. The following year, Cavalera Conspiracy went back into the studio to begin work on their follow-up album. In 2011, the brothers released their second blast of groove metal heaviness, the appropriately titled Blunt Force Trauma, with the relentlessly brutal and more grindcore-oriented Pandemonium appearing in 2014. The similarly adrenaline-fueled Psychosis appeared three years later, marking the end of Marc Rizzo's tenure with the group. Now operating as a duo, the brothers elected to pare down their name as well, releasing 2023's Morbid Visions, a muscular re-recording of Sepultura's classic though decidedly lo-fi 1984 debut album, under the Cavalera banner. Later that year, the duo issued a re-recording of Sepultura's 1985 EP, Bestial Devastation. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi\"\n",

      "\"Archspire's 2017 Relentless Mutation was a cavalcade of speed and extremity — blasting, accelerating and, in partial reference to its title, “mutating” as each song unfolded, all the while rapid-fire, shotgun vocals blurred the lines between a man's throat and additional instrument. It was, unquestionably, an innovation of sound and technique — Archspire had broken the speed barrier while creating songs memorable as they were unabashedly extreme for extreme metal. Thus, the pressure was already there to top Relentless Mutation when the band started to compile new songs in 2018. The global pandemic heightened the situation (read: no touring, expanded free time) and caused Archspire to turn inward and apply additional rigor to their songwriting process, albeit painstakingly so. But by the end of the fraught calendar year that was 2020, the band emerged with their fourth studio album, Bleed the Future.According to the members of Archspire — vocalist Oli Aleron, guitarists Dean Lamb and Tobi Morelli, bassist Jared Smith and drummer Spencer Prewett — they originally went into the making of Bleed the Future under the idea they would finish the album in between the various tours scheduled for 2020. Of course, none of that happened, prompting the band to do more pre-production than at any time in their career. Archspire then subjected the album's eight songs to near-constant critiquing that ensured they came away with a product, that in their estimation, is their best to date!\"\n",

      "'East Coast metalcore/deathcore ensemble the Acacia Strain utilize a bone-crushing rhythm section, apocalyptic samples, and a unique triple-guitar assault to deliver their signature blend of hardcore, noise, and death and doom metal. Emerging in the early 2000s, the band found success in 2008 with their fourth full-length effort, Continent, which soared to the top of Billboard\\'s U.S. Heatseekers chart. Subsequent efforts like Death Is the Only Mortal (2012), Coma Witch (2014), It Comes in Waves (2019), and Step Into the Light (2023) continued to snap necks in the metal community with brutal efficacy.Formed in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 2001, the group consisted of guitarists Chris Daniele, Daniel Daponde, and Daniel Laskiewitz, vocalist Vincent Bennett, bass player Karrie Whitfield, and drummer Ben Abert. They released their debut, ...And Life Is Very Long, in 2002, followed by 3750 on Prosthetic Records in 2004. After 3750, the band lost Abert (who was replaced by drummer Kevin Boutot) and Daniele, and gained bassist Seth Coleman (Whitfield departed in 2003). In 2006, the Acacia Strain returned with their third full-length album, Dead Walk, on Prosthetic; subsequently, Coleman was replaced by bassist Jack Strong. Released in 2008, Continent found the group operating as a foursome, following Daponde\\'s departure, while 2010\\'s Wormwood introduced melodic hooks into the venomous mix of breakdowns and skull-splitting howling. The live CD/DVD Most Known Unknown arrived the following year. The Acacia Strain signed to Rise Records in 2012, releasing Death Is the Only Mortal by year\\'s end. Longtime member Laskiewitz left the band in 2013, and was replaced by Devin Shidaker and Rich Gomez, both of whom contributed guitar to the Acacia Strain\\'s seventh full-length album, 2014\\'s Coma Witch. In early 2017, the group issued \"Bitter Pill,\" the first single from their eighth studio long-player, Gravebloom, which arrived later that June. In late 2019, the band released the horror-themed It Comes in Waves, a doomy, taut, and atmospheric seven-song set with single-word song titles that, when put together, construct the sentence \"Our only sin was giving them names.\" The following year saw the Acacia Strain issue a series of pummeling 7\" releases (A, C, E, D, Y) that went on to form (and spell) the full-length Slow Decay, which reached no.1 on multiple Billboard rock charts. 2023\\'s Step Into the Light saw the band embrace the metallic hardcore sound of their early days with a set fueled by complex guitar work and rhythmic beatdowns. Failure Will Follow, a sludge/doom metal mini-album featuring collaborations with Full of Hell\\'s Dylan Walker, Primitive Man\\'s Ethan McCarthy, and industrial goth rocker iRis.EXE, appeared later that year. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

Then, with the pandemic causing a forced shutdown, the group simmered in a state of reflection. They took time to process the last few years and, for Sean McCulloch specifically, acknowledge and face some of the darker parts of life he had ignored. \"Stillness amplified some struggles I knew I had but hadn\\'t processed,\" notes McCulloch. \"For the first time, I had to deal head-on with fear and anxiety.\" Through therapy and self-realization, Phinehas—made up of McCulloch, Bryce Kelley, Daniel Gailey, and Isaiah Perez—embarked on their first record solely about themselves. \"It\\'s easy to write about things other people are going through,\" explains McCulloch, \"but it\\'s nearly impossible for me to write about myself.”The result of their efforts became The Fire Itself, a transparent outpouring of McCulloch\\'s internal thoughts. Intentional, painful, and wholly authentic, the album presses into what it\\'s like to be a broken human being. Instrumentally the album is just as thoughtful but with a sharper edge than records past. Focusing less on individual parts and more on how the songs operate as a whole, Phinehas created a record that cuts straight to the core of who they are.'\n",

      "\"Railing against its origins in sunny, affluent Orange County, California, Bleeding Through specialize in unapologetically dark and fierce metalcore, with elements of melodic death and black metal tossed in for good measure. Since debuting in 2002 with the ferocious Portrait of the Goddess, the band have expanded their traditional hardcore sound into something more versatile and malevolent via more death metal-forward outings like 2004's This Is Love, This Is Murderous and 2006's The Truth. The band ceased operations in 2014 with a farewell show in Anaheim, but surprised fans in 2018 with a brand-new album, Love Will Kill All. The band formed in the year 1999, featuring vocalist Brandan Schieppati, guitarists Brian Leppke and Scott Danough, bassist Ryan Wombacher, drummer Derek Youngsma, and keyboardist Marta Peterson. Unlike other Orange County bands, Bleeding Through didn't play pop, ska, hardcore, or even punk, but rather crushing aggro-deathcore popular among many post-millennial American post-screamo bands. Bleeding Through have ties to other area bands Eighteen Visions and Throwdown, as some members (past and present, like Schieppati and Marc Jackson) have logged time between acts. After debuting with 2002's Portrait of the Goddess, Schieppati chose to focus completely on Bleeding Through and the group signed with New Jersey-based Trustkill Records, unleashing two well-regarded albums in 2004's This Is Love, This Is Murderous and 2006's The Truth. As Bleeding Through worked on material for their next album, the first member change in three years occurred in spring 2007 when Danough was replaced by ex-I Killed the Prom Queen guitarist Jona Weinhofen. Released in 2008, Declaration, a concept album about the trials and tribulations of life on the road, ignited a public feud with Trustkill over unpaid royalties, lack of funding, and release schedules, culminating in a move in 2010 to Oregon-based Rise Records for the band's eponymous sixth album and 2012 follow-up, The Great Fire. In 2013 the bandmembers announced that their upcoming tour would be their last, with the group's final show occurring at Chain Reaction in Anaheim on August 3, 2014. Much to their fans' surprise, Bleeding Through reported in March 2018 that they had inked a deal with SharpTone, and would be releasing a new album.

Established by guitarists Love Magnusson and John Berg, the group eventually expanded into a five-piece with the additions of drummer Georg Härnsten Egg, bassist Joel Fox Apelgren, and powerhouse vocalist Nils Molin. 2009's Bring the Thunder served as the band's introduction, but it was 2011's Knock You Down and 2012's Sultans of Sin that caught the heavy metal community's attention, with the latter LP arriving in the midst of the group's almost-successful run on that year's Melodifestivalen, Sweden's annual Eurovision qualifying music competition. The group inked a deal with Spinefarm Records for their fourth studio effort, 2013's Renatus, which saw Dynazty leaning harder into the power side of the metal spectrum and featured a re-tooled lineup (Berg was replaced by new six-stringer Mikael Lavér and Jonathan Olsson took over bass duties from Apelgren).

      "'Kamelot is a shapeshifting, musically adept American, German, and Swedish hard rock unit that skillfully blends elements of classical and symphonic metal with gothic/doom metal and progressive rock. Founded by Florida-based multi-instrumentalist Thomas Youngblood, the band has endured numerous lineup changes since releasing their 1995 debut Eternity. From 1999\\'s The Fourth Legacy to 2007\\'s Ghost Opera, Kamelot established a core sound internationally recognized for juxtaposing metallic power and keen melodic sensibilities. 2015\\'s Haven charted globally. The band returned from the pandemic with 2023\\'s Awakening.Multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Thomas Youngblood and drummer Richard Warner formed Kamelot in Tampa, Florida in early 1991 with vocalist Mark Vanderbilt and bassist Sean Tibbetts. After writing and seemingly endless rehearsals, Kamelot issued its first demo late in the year and followed it with another in 1993 before signing to Noise Records. Keyboardist David Pavlicko joined the lineup as bassist Glenn Barry replaced Tibbetts for their debut full-length Eternity in 1995. The set was greeted by positive reviews in the U.S. Dominion followed a year later with the same lineup, but the band got to tour Europe and established a fan base there.The first major lineup changes occurred when Youngblood replaced Warner with Casey Grillo and vocalist Vanderbilt with singer/lyricist Roy S. Khan (ex- and future Conception) for 1998\\'s Siége Perilous. This lineup provided the musical, dynamic, and sonic foundations for the rest of their catalog, though Pavlicko left after the tour. 1999\\'s The Fourth Legacy saw the lineup as a trio, though Avantasia\\'s Michael Rodenberg (aka Miro Rodenberg) guested on keyboards, provided orchestrations, and co-produced the set with Avantasia\\'s guitarist Sascha Paeth. The personnel also included an operatic female chorus, a string quartet, and multiple drummers. The album\\'s release was received with global enthusiasm; many critics felt the group had evolved into a mature, adventurous unit whose music equally balanced power, prog, and symphonic metal with exotic arrangements. 2001\\'s Karma offered Kamelot as a replenished quartet with the addition of bassist Glenn Barry. Again co-produced by Rodenberg -- who also provided orchestrations -- and Paeth, the set\\'s instrumentation offered strings and multiple choirs, hooky lyrical melodies, powerful dynamics, and dazzling musicianship. 2003\\'s Epica was the band\\'s final offering for Noise. A concept album based on Faust, its dynamic, theatrical narrative was performed with assistance of a symphony orchestra arranged by Rodenberg who again co-produced with Paeth; the latter also guested on guitar. Male and female choirs were prominent in the execution as were exotic instruments, from an upright bass to Fabricio Alejandra\\'s bandoneón, Guitarist Luca Turilli also guested on the album. Epica won at least as many critical accolades as Karma and sold better. Critics remarked on the band\\'s ability to render a progressive, power metal concept that avoided genre tropes and redundancies. Paired with their incendiary stage presence, Kamelot signed a deal with SPV-Steamhammer to record their seventh long-player, and second concept album, The Black Halo. With a bigger recording budget, Kamelot pulled out all the stops. Co-producers Paeth and Rodenberg added a massive symphony orchestra, the biggest choirs yet, assistance from jazz pianist Jens Johansson, and guest vocal soloists who included Dimmu Borgir\\'s Shagrath and Epica\\'s Simone Simons. With extremely tight arrangements, an imaginative sonic and textural palette, and a winning concept, Black Halo was Kamelot\\'s finest work to date and guaranteed them higher profile gigs on both sides of the Atlantic. The 2006 live album One Cold Winters Night -- recorded in Oslo, Norway before an adoring crowd -- followed in 2006.Released in 2007, Ghost Opera showcased a new quintet roster with touring keyboardist Oliver Palotai added to the studio lineup. Simons and future Exit Eden lead vocalist Amanda Sommerville (also a vocal coach of considerable renown) were featured in the choir and as soloists. Produced by the team of Paeth and Rodenberg, the set was so well received it found its way into the U.S. Top 200. In December 2009, Youngblood announced that bassist Barry had left the band and was replaced by the touring bassist and returning member Sean Tibbetts. 2010\\'s Poetry for the Poisoned offered a startling change of direction. Recorded in a cabin in Norway, the 14-song set abandoned power metal for gothic metal balanced with prog metal and electronica with uncharacteristically polished production from Paeth and Rodenberg. Simons sang lead on three tracks while Soilwork\\'s Bjorn Strid and Savatage\\'s Jon Oliva and Chanty \"Fräulein\" Wunder sang lead on one track each. Sommerville appeared on backing vocals and Firewind guitarist Gus G (Konstantinos Karamitroudis) guested. It was Khan\\'s final outing with Kamelot. He fell seriously ill on the eve of their North American tour and was replaced by several singers including Simons, EdenEcho, and Tommy Karevik. After a long convalescence, Khan eventually returned to his first band, Conception. Kamelot\\'s Poetry for the Poisoned entered the top 200 at number 74 and peaked at 60.Karevik was hired as Kamelot\\'s permanent lead vocalist following the tour. His first studio outing with the band was 2012\\'s Silverthorn. Their third concept offering, the album\\'s central narrative centers on a little girl named Jolee during the 19th century. She dies in a tragic accident witnessed by her twin brothers. The story then relates how the girl\\'s affluent family behaves in the aftermath. It charted in 14 countries including the U.S., where it peaked at 79 in the Top 200, and at number nine on the Hard Rock Albums list. Paeth and Rodenberg appeared as well as co-produced. with the latter delivering his trademark orchestrations supplied by a string quartet, choirs (including a children\\'s choir), and a driving, symphonic power metal mix. They toured in 2013 and 2014 in Europe and North and South America. Palotai was replaced on tour by Epica keyboardist Coen Janssen. Kamelot signed with Napalm Records in 2014. Following an early 2015 North American tour, they released Haven in May. In addition to choirs, the Paeth/Rodenberg production credited both men as instrumental contributors; Palotai handled the lion\\'s share of orchestrations. The set boasted two guest vocalists in Arch Enemy\\'s Alissa White-Gluz and Phantasma\\'s Charlotte Wessels, and traditional Celtic musician Troy Donockley on Uillean Pipes. A week after its release, the album topped the U.S. Hard Rock charts. 2017 concluded the Haven World Tour with shows in Russia, Greece, and Israel.In February 2018, Kamelot announced that longtime drummer Grillo would be leaving the band after three decades. He\\'d already been replaced on select tour dates by Alex Landenburg (Luca Turilli\\'s Rhapsody). In April, they issued The Shadow Theory, their 12th studio album. Firewind drummer Johan Nunez served as replacement drummer. The Paeth/Rodenberg production included three choirs and guest vocalists Jennifer Harben (Beyond the Black) and Once Human\\'s Lauren Hart. The set peaked at number two on the Hard Rock Albums chart and topped streaming metal lists. The band hit the road with Delain and Battle Beast, but after only two shows, Nunez had to be replaced due to an injury. Landenburg once more filled the chair for the remainder of the tour across North America, Europe, and Australia. He was announced as the band\\'s permanent drummer in April 2019. They recorded the live album I Am the Empire: Live from the 013 in Tilburg, Netherlands in September with Wessels, Elize Ryd (Amaranthe, Raskasta Joulua), Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), the Burns to Embrace Children\\'s Choir, string quartet Eklipse, and Paeth as guests. The DVD/Blu-ray for the live release was later announced in June 2020 and released in August.During the pandemic, Youngblood, Karevik, and Palotai wrote intently, sharing files over the internet. They composed a total of 25 songs that they whittled down before recording. The Awakening was scheduled for a March 2021 release but was delayed for a solid two years, appearing in March 2023 as the band toured Brazil. The 13-song set was produced solely by Paeth and featured classical cellist Tina Guo, Simons, and Ad Infinitum\\'s Melissa Bonny as guests. ~ Thom Jurek &amp; James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

Emerging in 2005 with Nosferatu, the band\\'s dark image, which included corpse paint-style makeup, suggested a proclivity for black metal, but their sound hewed closer to anthemic power metal stalwarts like Helloween and Hammerfall. Bloodbound continued to explore the realms of epic fantasy metal on subsequent outings like Tabula Rasa (2009), Stormborn (2014), and Rise of the Dragon Empire (2019). Bloodbound were formed in the summer of 2004 by kindred metallic spirits Tomas Olsson (lead guitar) and Fredrik Bergh (keyboards), both of whom had cut their teeth with several bands over the years before first joining forces in the short-lived Street Talk. Looking to make a strong impression from the get-go, the duo convinced experienced frontman Urban Breed, formerly of Tad Morose, to join Bloodbound\\'s ranks, then completed the band\\'s lineup with drummer Pelle Åkerlind (ex-Morgana LeFay), bassist Johan Sohlberg, and Olsson\\'s brother Henrik as rhythm guitarist. This quintet recorded 2006\\'s well-received freshman LP Nosferatu, but their much-vaunted \"blood brothers\" kinship was sadly already dissolved by the release of 2007\\'s sophomore Book of the Dead, where Michael Bormann stepped in as vocalist and Bergh took over bass duties from the departed Sohlberg.

      "'THERION have always been a band that have challenged themselves to explore new paths, while remaining true to their musical core values. For their 17th studio album, mastermind Christofer Johnsson and his collaborator Thomas Vikström have created something that has been previously unthinkable to the guitarist and the singer. \"We have done the only thing that was left of all the different angles to explore\", explains Christofer. \"We have decided to give the people what they kept asking for. \\'Leviathan\\' is the first album that we have deliberately packed with THERION hit songs.When THERION came into being in 1988 by changing name from the already existing band BLITZKRIEG, which was founded a year earlier, Christofer had rather taken inspiration from SLAYER\\'s \"Reign In Blood\"among other classic metal albums. At the beginning, the Swedes were firmly rooted in death metal, a genre which they helped to define, as witnessed by their debut album \"Of Darkness....\"(1991). Yet even back then, there were hints of \"something else\" lurking beneath the rough surface.The use of female vocals is another core ingredient of THERION today, which developed gradually. CELTIC FROST had basically introduced the female element to extreme metal on \"To Mega Therion\"in 1985. THERION began with both a female and male vocalist emulating a church like choir already in their sophomore full-length \\'Beyond Sanctorum\\' (1992).'\n",

      "'Blind Guardian emerged from western Germany in the mid-\\'80s with a style that fused gothic- and fantasy-tinged European power metal with the velocity and technical precision of speed metal. Since debuting in 1988 with the thrashy and raw Battalions of Fear, the band has become an institution in power, progressive, and neo-classical metal circles, delivering genre classics Nightfall in Middle-Earth (1998), A Night at the Opera (2002), and A Twist in the Myth (2006), plus orchestral works such as Legacy of the Dark Lands (2019) that skillfully pair fantastical narratives with ace musicianship. God Machine, the band\\'s 20th full-length effort, was released in 2022. Forming in the small German town of Krefeld, members Hansi Kürsch (vocals, bass), Marcus Siepen (guitar), André Olbrich (guitar), and Thomen Stauch (drums) initially called themselves Lucifer\\'s Heritage, but elected to change it when a 1986 demo tape began to achieve underground popularity. They signed with the No Remorse label and issued the thrash-heavy Battalions of Fear in 1988, following it with the like-minded Follow the Blind a year later, which helped make a name for the band in Japan. Released in 1990, the still speedy but decidedly more power metal-influenced Tales from the Twilight World became an underground hit in Germany and led to a deal with that country\\'s division of Virgin Records. Their major-label debut, Somewhere Far Beyond, was released in 1992, and helped create the nickname \"bards\" -- taken from the two-part \"Bard\\'s Song\" -- for the group\\'s fans. After 1993\\'s live Tokyo Tales, Blind Guardian hooked up with former Metallica producer Flemming Rasmussen for 1995\\'s acclaimed Imaginations from the Other Side. Issued in 1996, The Forgotten Tales was a collection of covers and alternate versions, setting the stage for 1998\\'s breakout hit Nightfall in Middle-Earth, a grandiose, Tolkien-inspired concept album and the band\\'s first American release. Century Media began reissuing portions of the band\\'s back catalog in the U.S. the following year, and in 2002, the group released A Night at the Opera, their most progressive and sonically opulent outing to date. 2006\\'s A Twist in the Myth followed suit, administering copious amounts of guitarmonies and symphonic flourishes, and drawing lyrical inspiration from the likes of Stephen King\\'s Dark Tower series and Dante Alighieri\\'s Inferno. They issued their ninth studio album, At the Edge of Time, in 2010, followed by a compilation of re-recorded and remixed songs called Memories of a Time to Come in 2012. In 2015, the band returned with their tenth studio long-player, Beyond the Red Mirror, a concept album and sequel to 1995\\'s Imaginations from the Other Side. Around the time of the recording of Nightfall in Middle-Earth, guitarist André Olbrich and vocalist Hansi Kürsch began discussing how they could parlay their newfound power metal momentum into something a bit more ornate. The resulting Legacy of the Dark Lands, an ambitious and all-orchestral double album, was released in 2019 under the amended moniker Blind Guardian\\'s Twilight Orchestra. Returning to the epic power metal approach of past efforts, God Machine (the band\\'s first proper studio album since 2015\\'s Beyond the Red Mirror) was released in 2022. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Greece's SepticFlesh emerged in the early '90s with a visceral and uncompromising sound that looked as much to the cavernous halls of doom metal for inspiration as it did the icy vistas of black and death metal. The band's style has evolved over the years, taking on elements of neo-classical and symphonic metal, a theatrical and brutal approach that they perfected in the 2000s on stand-out LPs Sumerian Demons (2003), The Great Mass (2011), Codex Omega (2017), and Modern Primitive (2022). Formed in Athens in the early '90s by Sotiris Vayenas (guitar), Spiros Antoniou (bass and vocals), and Christos Antoniou (guitars), the band quickly released a debut EP, Temple of the Lost Race, in 1991. Their first official full-length, Mystic Places of Dawn, followed in 1994. From there, they released a handful of albums, notably taking on a female soprano vocalist (Natalie Rassoulis) for the recording of 1997's Ophidian Wheel and 1998's A Fallen Temple, both of which saw the group moving toward a more symphonic style of death metal. In 1999, the band was able to snag the services of legendary producer Fredrik Nordström (Opeth, At the Gates) for that year's Revolution DNA. With a number of albums receiving positive responses and a handful of successful tours, SepticFlesh soon signed to Hammerheart, which released their next album, Sumerian Daemons, in 2003. Although the band's star was on the rise, things were not what they seemed, and SepticFlesh decided to call it a day later that year. Christos went off to focus on work with Chaostar, late-arriving keyboardist Bob Katsionis worked with Nightfall, and Sotiris started a solo project under the moniker Aenaos. But, as with most bands, a little time and space were all that was needed, and in 2007 SepticFlesh announced a reunion appearance at that year's Metal Healing Festival in their native Greece. The band soon signed a new deal with French label Season of Mist, and released its seventh album, Communion, in 2008. The new-look SepticFlesh, rounded out by Fotis Benardo on drums, also featured an 80-musician/32-vocalist orchestra and choir. The Great Mass (2011) and Titan (2014) were similarly ambitious affairs that utilized the talents of the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, and Codex Omega (2017), the band's tenth studio long-player, was produced by extreme metal specialist Jens Bogren (Opeth, Dimmu Borgir). In 2020 the band released the epic and fully orchestrated live LP and concert film Infernus Sinfonica Mmxix. Two years later, SepticFlesh returned with their 11th full-length effort, the deeply melodic and cinematic Modern Primitive. ~ Chris True, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Avantasia is a symphonic power metal project founded and led by Tobias Sammet, lead singer of German power metal band Edguy. Since 2001\\'s debut, the fantasy-themed The Metal Opera, Sammet has enlisted a who\\'s-who of European and American metal musicians and singers for his albums. He crafted the name by combining the words \"avalon\" and \"fantasia,\" which he described as \"a world beyond human imagination.\" Each album in the Avantasia catalog offers a different concept and narrative articulated by a core group and a plethora of guests. The Avantasia sound signature offers extremely melodic symphonic power metal, delivered with high production values and stunning vocals and harmonies. 2008\\'s The Scarecrow charted in eight countries, while 2010\\'s The Wicked Symphony did so in a dozen. 2016\\'s Ghostlights was certified gold, while 2019\\'s Moonglow went to number one. Sammet and Avantasia returned in October 2022 with A Paranormal Evening with the Moonflower Society.Avantasia was originally conceived as a one-off studio project, an extension of Sammet\\'s work with Edguy but also completely separate from it. Their 11-minute title single was issued in 2000, followed by the full-length albums The Metal Opera and The Metal Opera, Vol. 2 in 2001 and 2002, respectively. He revived the project by popular demand for 2007\\'s The Scarecrow, and has kept up a schedule of intermittent recording and touring ever since. Avantasia\\'s always-sold-out tours are grand events utilizing not only a large cast of metal musicians, but also symphony orchestras and elaborate light and stage sets.Sammet spent a year composing the material for The Metal Opera, and recruited various vocalists to tell his story, including Gamma Ray\\'s Kai Hansen, Stratovarius\\' Timo Tolkki, and Within Temptation\\'s Sharon den Adel. The backing band featured guitarists Jens Ludwig (Edguy) and Henjo Richter (Gamma Ray), bassist Markus Grosskopf (Helloween), and drummer Alex Holzwarth (Rhapsody). The 2001 album was filled with fantasy themes and anthemic, progressive pomp-metal. It was followed by 2002\\'s The Metal Opera, Vol. 2 and a European festival tour. Sammet put the project on hiatus for nearly six years -- as he worked and traveled with Edguy -- before reassembling a new version of Avantasia for the EPs: Lost in Space, Pt. I and Pt. II in late 2007, all the while composing a trilogy of albums known as the \"Wicked Trilogy,\" comprised of 2008\\'s The Scarecrow, 2010\\'s The Wicked Symphony, and 2011\\'s Angel of Babylon. Given the success of the world tours organized around the latter two records, Sammet became even more ambitious as a composer and conceptualist, deciding to make Avantasia releases even more epic in scale.In 2013, Avantasia issued The Mystery of Time, a full-scale conceptual collaboration with the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg. The list of vocalists was impressive: Joe Lynn Turner, frequent collaborator and ex-Helloween frontman Michael Kiske, Saxon\\'s Biff Byford, and Magnum\\'s Bob Catley among them (sometimes two or three at a time). The album charted at number two in Germany, and in the Top Ten across Europe. It also entered the U.S. charts at number nine -- the first of the band\\'s recordings to make the Top Ten. The outfit undertook another five-month tour, playing three-hour shows and selling out venues, as well as appearing at festivals in Europe, South America, Japan, Russia, and Canada. The series culminated in a headline position at the Wacken Open Air Festival, a performance Sammet claimed was Avantasia\\'s last. (Granted, the claim was only in reference to live performances, as The Mystery of Time left an open-ended question in its narrative.)In January 2016, Avantasia released the sequel, Ghostlights. Many of the same singers returned and Sammet added to their numbers with appearances by Geoff Tate, Dee Snider, den Adel, and Ronnie Atkins, to name a few. The inevitable tour that followed pushed the album to number seven on the U.S. Hard Rock charts and to number 101 on the Top 200 as well as the Top 40 in a dozen other countries. (The first single, \"Mystery of a Blood Red Rose,\" was a German candidate in the 2016 Eurovision Song Contest.) The band\\'s tour concluded with a headline spot at 2017\\'s Wacken Open Air Festival. In the aftermath, Sammet worked live and in-studio with Edguy, but was also composing and recruiting for the next Avantasia offering. In March of 2018, he posted artwork for the project\\'s eighth album, Moonglow, that centered around'\n",

In their case, this vocalist is operatically trained soprano Floor Jansen, whose contributions bring bands like the Gathering, Tristania, and Nightwish to mind. Alongside guitarists Sander Gommans and Mark Jansen, bassist Luuk van Gerven, keyboardist Jack Driessen, and drummer Joep Beckers, she helped transform mid-\\'90s metal band Apocalyps into After Forever while most members were still in their teens. Signing with Transmission Records, the band issued their debut album, Prison of Desire to great acclaim in the year 2000, then quickly followed it with 2001\\'s more refined Decipher (featuring new keyboard player Lando van Gils, and drummer Andre Borgman). With their profile now rising fast (at least domestically), two singles, \"Emphasis\" and \"Monolith of Doubt,\" were extracted from the latter album to title E.P. releases, and Floor also found time to lend her talents to space-metal composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen\\'s vaunted Star One project. 2003 saw the release of an EP/DVD named Exordium &amp; Insights, and after replacing original guitarist Mark Jansen with Bas Maas, After Forever released their third full-length album in 2004\\'s Invisible Circles. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

Although clearly owing a debt to the pioneering melodic death metal bands of the ‘90s, guitarist Per Nilsson and his comrades were walking their own evolutionary path. But Scar Symmetry have been conspicuous by their absence since concluding touring in support of 2014's astonishing, cosmic odyssey The Singularity (Phase I - Neohumanity). The first in a planned trilogy, the album was widely praised for the sheer audacity of Nilsson's still-mutating vision. In 2023, Scar Symmetry unveil the second chapter in this intricate, intergalactic saga: The Singularity (Phase II - Xenotaph). Harder, darker, more complex and more joyously progressive than ever, it is more than worth the nine-year wait.Per Nilsson cheerfully admits that creating a follow-up to Phase I took longer than expected because, not unreasonably, he simply had other things to do, including touring the world with Meshuggah, as stand-in for the temporarily absent Fredrik Thordendal. Now that the world has largely woken from its Covid-induced stupor, Per Nilsson is looking forward to fully reactivating Scar Symmetry and taking the dramatic, pulverising events of Phase II to the people.

      "'Nasum, a Swedish grindcore band formed in 1992 by Necrony members Anders Jakobson (guitar) and Rickard Alriksson (drums and vocals), would develop into one of that country\\'s premier metal acts, but would be felled tragically by the events of the December 2004 tsunami that brought mass destruction to Thailand, ending the life of (eventual) vocalist and beloved member Mieszko Talarczyk. The original idea was to create a more pure Napalm Death-style grindcore act, based less on theatrics and gore and more on a straight-ahead political message, and although the band sort of let that concept fall to the wayside at the outset, the label that handled parent band Necrony offered Nasum a slot on a split EP. With the idea of recording for an actual release as motivation, Nasum took on a new member in guitarist Talarczyk and recorded six tracks, which would end up on the Blind World split EP, with the band Agathocles making up the remainder. A handful of compilation appearances followed, as well as a few more split 7\" appearances, which led to Nasum securing a deal to record an MCD (mini compact disc) of their own with Poserlsaughter Records in 1995. With the release of the MCD ready to roll, label Poserslaughter scored Nasum a gig in Germany, but founder and drummer Alriksson balked at the notion of live performance, and called it a day. Jakobson would eventually move into the vacant drummer\\'s position, and Talarczyk would take on vocal duties in addition to guitar in response to the sudden roster change. More recording -- for EPs, splits, and compilations -- followed over 1996 and 1997, and in 1998 Nasum released their first full-length album, Inhale/Exhale, on Relapse, an American label that had fallen in love with the band\\'s sound after hearing Nasum\\'s recent recordings. With momentum and popularity on the rise and an ever increasing performance schedule, Nasum opted to move past the days of the duo and added full-time bassist Jesper Liveröd (from Burst) in late 1998. The band finished up the millennium appearing at the Milwaukee Metal Fest as well as entering the studio to work on album number two. In April of 2000, Human 2.0 was released, and the band spent the lion\\'s share of the next two-plus years touring and performing in support of the work, including a stop in Japan. Released in 2003, Helvete, which featured the talents ofNapalm Death\\'s Shane Embury, was well received, and led to even more high-profile appearances, especially on the European festival circuit. During the development of Helvete, Nasum added second guitarist Urban Skytt and bassist Jon Lindqvist, who took the place of departing member Liveröd. In 2004, Nasum unveiled album number four, Shift, and followed the release with further touring. Plans for the new year were being laid out -- including new recordings and tours -- as the year wound down, and with a break in the action, vocalist and guitarist Talarczyk decided on a Thai vacation to celebrate his 30th birthday. After the tsunami hit that country -- a result from a massive earthquake in the Indian Ocean -- Talarczyk was listed as missing. Fearing the worst, the band decided to end Nasum, and on February 17, 2005, Talarczyk\\'s death was officially confirmed. To celebrate and honor the work of Talarczyk and Nasum, a two-disc compilation of all of the band\\'s non-album work was made available in 2006, entitled Grind Finale. A live album featuring a 2004 show from Osaka, entitled Doombringer, was released in early 2008.

      "'East coast grindcore band Pig Destroyer formed in the late \\'90s and quickly joined a wave of bands who would define the sound of extreme music over the following years. Playing without a bassist in their earlier phases, their sound was a noisy and unhinged take on grindcore elements, with short and complex songs, dual vocals, spazzy blastbeats, and occasional hints of metallic hardcore. The band quickly became highly active in D.I.Y. punk circles, touring and releasing splits with contemporaries like Orchid, Gnob, Converge, Isis, Drop Dead, and other highly respected grind and hardcore bands. Pig Destroyer\\'s output was prolific early on, with multiple lesser releases, 7\"s, and compilation appearances bridging more fully formed albums. In 2000 the band signed to Relapse Records, which would be their home for the next decade and beyond. 2001 brought Prowler in the Yard, a high-water mark for focus and intensity for the band. Lineup changes and stylistic shifts would mark later material, as the band moved from their grindcore beginnings into doomier sludge and even sound collage-like experiments on later releases like 2008\\'s Natasha and 2014\\'s Mass &amp; Volume.Pig Destroyer was formed in Alexandria, Virginia in 1997 by drummer John Evans, guitarist Scott Hull, and vocalist J.R. Hayes. All of the members had been in other extreme bands, Hull playing with Anal Cunt and Agoraphobic Nosebleed and the other members briefly collaborating in hardcore band Treblinka before forming Pig Destroyer. The band settled on their name after deciding \"Cop Killer\" or \"Cop Destroyer\" were too heavy-handed but maintained a staunchly anti-authoritarian political stance in their early material. The band quickly released a demo as well as a split 7\" with Orchid, touring the east coast months into their existence and releasing debut album Explosions in Ward 6 in 1998. Evans quit the band in 1999 and was replaced by Brian Harvey. The band signed to heavyweight metal label Relapse in 2000 and promptly released 38 Counts of Battery, a massive collection that compiled remastered versions of all their material to date including songs from split releases and their original demos. 2001 saw the release of Prowler in the Yard, the band\\'s most focused and extreme statement up to that point. They reached a much wider audience on the strength of this record and would tour more extensively, playing lager festivals and overseas dates. Their next album, 2004\\'s Terrifyer, was a more polished and defined production. In 2006 the band welcomed Blake Harrison on, taking their sound to more outlandish places with samples and electronics, and he made his debut on their 2007 album Phantom Limb. In 2011 Harvey quit the band and was replaced by Adam Jarvis, who had formerly drummed for Misery Index. Their sound began shifting somewhat as they passed through their first decade of existence, flirting with elements of noise, sludge metal, hardcore, and even experimental collage on releases like 2012\\'s Book Burner and the sharp left turn toward doom metal on 2014 EP Mass &amp; Volume. In 2013 things shifted monumentally in the band\\'s sound with the addition of their first bass player, John Jarvis. 2015 saw a deluxe reissue of Prowler in the Yard with completely remixed and remastered versions of the songs. In 2018 Pig Destroyer released their sixth album, Head Cage, the first full-length to include bass and heavy evidence that as the band entered their 20th year they were in no way mellowing with age. ~ Fred Thomas, Rovi'\n",

Exhumed formed in 1990 with a lineup consisting of Harvey (guitar, vocals), Col Jones (drums), Derrel Houdashelt (guitar), Jake Giardina (vocals), and Ben Marrs (bass). They made their first recordings in this formation, including the Excreting Innards 7\" for Afterworld Records. Giardina and Marrs left the band within the next few years, with Matt Widener (bass) and Ross Sewage (vocals) brought in as replacements. After recording the Horrific Expulsion of Gore demo (1994), Widener left and Sewage took over bass duties. This lineup eventually recorded a split-LP with the Ohio band Hemdale, In the Name of Gore, which came out on Visceral Productions in 1995 and featured an absolutely revolting album cover. Soon after, Houdashelt left and was eventually replaced by Mike Beams. With this lineup intact, they signed to Relapse Records and finally released their first official full-length, Gore Metal, in 1998, with guitarist James Murphy (Death, Obituary) at the production helm. Sewage left the band shortly after this record, leaving the trio of Harvey, Beams, and Jones to record the follow-up, Slaughtercult. The album was released on Relapse in 2000 and was enthusiastically received on the death metal scene. Exhumed supported the album with three coast-to-coast American tours and a European one, where they co-headlined the Fuck the Commerce Festival in Germany and the Obscene Extreme Festival in the Czech Republic. In 2003, they recorded the more progressively arranged -- and most critically acclaimed -- Anatomy Is Destiny, which was released by Relapse. Bassist Bud Burke left the band before their tour and was replaced by Leon del Muerte. Exhumed experienced another critical blow following their U.S. and European tours with the departure of founding member and drummer Col Jones. Rather than enter the studio without a permanent replacement, they chose instead to release the compilation Platters of Splatter and toured using fill-in drummers. The band also eventually lost guitarist Mike Beams before ax-man Wes Caley and drummer Matt Connell joined the band permanently. This version of Exhumed decided to follow Metallica\\'s concept of a covers album and issued Garbage Daze Re-Regurgitated in 2005; the band also assembled a concert film before disappearing from the scene for nearly five years. The quartet of del Muerte, Caley, Connell, and lone founding member Harvey (on guitar and vocals) spent a year writing and emerged with All Guts, No Glory on Relapse in the summer of 2011. Returning two years later in a completely different configuration, Harvey recorded the slow-grooved Necrocracy with a new rhythm section of Rob Babcock (bass) and Mike Hamilton (drums), and a former bassist, Bud Burke, playing guitar. In 2015, with early member Ross Sewage resuming his role as singer and bassist and Burke moving to guitar, Exhumed re-recorded their debut album and issued it under the title Gore Metal: A Necrospective 1998-2015. With the same lineup intact, they produced the band\\'s seventh effort, 2017\\'s Death Revenge, again on Relapse. Eighth album Horror arrived two years later. Recorded at the band\\'s home studio, the effort was raw and less complex than some of their earlier material. Harvey conscripted Mike Beams, Leon del Muerte, Matt Widener, and Bud Burke to help flesh out the gore metal veterans\\' unrelenting ninth LP, To the Dead. ~ William York &amp; Thom Jurek, Rovi'\n",

Their first effort came in the form of the 2010 EP Vold, which showcased the band's short blasts of ultra-violent grindcore with some black metal undercurrents. That EP was followed by Fear in 2011.

      "'Headed by guitarist/bassist/drum programmer Scott Hull (also of Pig Destroyer and formerly of A.C. as well), grindcore nut-cases Agoraphobic Nosebleed have existed in various forms since 1994. Their bleak, punishing sound mixes together caustic vocals, harsh (and inhumanly fast) drum-machine beats, and Hull\\'s Earache-schooled guitar riffing. Their songs are short and compact, in most cases clocking in at less than a minute long. Their lyrics are often as unorthodox and/or inscrutable as the band\\'s name and song titles (e.g., \"Chalking the Temporal God Module,\" \"The Fatter You Fall Behind,\" \"Lives Ruined Through Sex\") would seem to suggest. Topics such as crackpot apocalypse theories, homophobia and misogyny, drug conspiracies, mind control, rampant capitalism and consumerism, and bio-terrorism have all surfaced in their songs; and are often addressed in ambiguous, free-associative ways, interspersed with plenty of tasteless scatological outbursts, sometimes with a humorous slant and sometimes not. Following a few split and EP releases and a couple of lineup shifts, Agoraphobic Nosebleed\\'s first \"full-length\" -- the 26-song, 19-minute Honky Reduction -- came out in 1998 on Relapse Records and was recorded by the lineup of Hull and vocalist/electronics manipulator Jay Randall. The following year saw the release of a 6\" EP entitled PCP Tornado as well as a split CD with the Boston, MA, hardcore band Converge entitled The Poacher Diaries. For The Poacher Diaries, Agoraphobic Nosebleed\\'s lineup was expanded to include a second vocalist, J.R. Hayes (also the lead vocalist for Pig Destroyer). Agoraphobic Nosebleed\\'s second full-length, the long-promised Frozen Corpse Stuffed With Dope, finally came out in 2002, once again on Relapse. This time around, Hull and Randall were officially joined by vocalist Carl Schultz and bassist/vocalist Richard Johnson (of Enemy Soil and the Index, and also a member of Agoraphobic Nosebleed in their earlier days). The album also featured guest vocal appearances by Hayes as well as members of Benumb, Necrophagia, Cephalic Carnage, and Brutal Truth. ~ William York, Rovi'\n",

The band inked a deal with Southern Lord ahead of the arrival of the release of their acclaimed sophomore album, Abandon All Life, and made the lateral move to Nuclear Blast for 2016\\'s You Will Never Be One of Us. In 2019 the band issued the brutal single \"I Don\\'t Want to Know You\" before going on an indefinite hiatus the following year.

Both releases gained wider distribution through a Southern Lord reissue. A second proper album, the hyper-intense and ultra-compact Abandon All Life arrived on the label in 2013, and three years later, the band unleashed their third long-player, You Will Never Be One of Us, this time via Nuclear Blast.

      "'On one level, Brujeria are a brutally powerful rock band whose music walks the border of grindcore and death metal. On another, Brujeria are a street-level exercise in performance art. To take them at their word, the members of Brujeria are leaders of a Mexican cartel of drug smugglers, ruthless men who use mutilation and murder to protect their interests. The members of Brujeria perform in disguise, and their music is a reflection of their sociopathic embrace of violence, drugs, and Satanism. However, it\\'s an open secret that Brujeria aren\\'t really members of a cartel -- the band began as the side project of several noted metal and punk musicians using their collective persona for dramatic effect as well as dark satire, introducing their alter egos on 1993\\'s Matando Güeros. The busy schedule of the musicians and periodic turnover in the lineup often resulted in long gaps between albums, but 2016\\'s brutal Pocho Aztlan was followed in relatively prompt fashion by 2023\\'s furious and doomstruck Esto Es Brujeria. Brujeria (Spanish for witchcraft) were formed in 1989 in Los Angeles, California. The original lineup featured vocalist Juan Brujo (aka John Lepe), guitarist Asesino (aka Dino Cazares, best known as guitarist with Fear Factory), bassist Güero Sin Fe (aka Billy Gould of Faith No More), and drummer Fantasma (aka Pat Hoed, who is a pro-wrestling commentator and radio host). Dead Kennedys founder Jello Biafra also participated in Brujeria\\'s early shows as vocalist Pito Wilson; he soon dropped out of the lineup, but released several Brujeria singles through his Alternative Tentacles Records label. In 1990, Brujeria released their debut single, \"¡Demoniaco!\" A second single, \"Machetazos,\" appeared in 1992; by this time, Pinche Peach had joined the group, taking over the second vocalist role left by Biafra\\'s departure, and Greñudo (aka Raymond Herrera, like Cazares a member of Fear Factory) became the band\\'s new drummer as Fantasma became an additional vocalist. In 1993, Brujeria released their first full-length, Matando Güeros. The cover featured a gruesome and authentic photo of a severed head, confirming the band intended to create an image as extreme as their music. The album also marked the debut of guitarist Hongo (aka Shane Embury of Napalm Death). With 1995\\'s Raza Odiada, Brujeria upped the political commentary in their music, with the title song taking aim at California Governor Pete Wilson, who was widely seen as racist in the Mexican-American community for his policies on immigration. (The album featured a vocal cameo from Biafra, impersonating Wilson.) The album also featured the song \"La Ley de Plomo,\" which remarkably managed to score some late-night play on MTV. Up until this time, Brujeria had been exclusively a studio project, in part because the other commitments of the musicians made scheduling difficult. As the group\\'s notoriety grew, there was an increased demand for live shows, and in January 1997, Brujeria took the stage for the first time at the Whisky A Go Go in Los Angeles; three songs from the show would later appear on the EP Marijuana, released in 2000. In 2000, the group dropped their third album, Brujerizmo, which added new characters to the lineup, including female vocalist and guitarist Pititis (aka Gaby Dominguez), guitarist Cristo de Pisto (aka Jesse Pintado of Terrorizer and Napalm Death), and second drummer Hongo Jr. (aka Nicholas Barker, of Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir). The album received positive reviews in the metal press, and became their biggest commercial success to date. In 2001, the group released a collection of B-sides, rare tracks, and fan favorites titled Mextremist! Greatest Hits, but a follow-up to Brujerizmo failed to appear. Instead, the group launched their first proper tour in late 2003, beginning in Chicago, Illinois and ending in Guadalajara, Mexico. (2003 also saw the release of another \"greatest-hits\" collection, The Mexicutioner! The Best of Brujeria.) A second tour in 2004 took the band to South America for the first time, but the group was struggling with internal strife, and Asesino and Güero Sin Fe both left the group, with Fantasma becoming the band\\'s new bassist. The group went on hiatus, and while they resumed touring in 2007, work on a new album progressed slowly, with a few tracks appearing on independent singles. In 2016, Brujeria made a splash in the music press with the release of \"Viva Presidente Trump!\" a tongue-in-cheek \"tribute\" to the (then) Republican presidential candidate whose outrageous statements about illegal immigrants made him a pariah in Mexico. In September 2016, Brujeria finally released their long-awaited fourth album, Pocho Aztlan. The lineup for the album featured Juan Brujo, Fantasma, Hongo, Pinche Peach, Hongo Jr., and Pititis, along with new members El Cynico (bass and guitar; aka Jeffrey Walker of Carcass), and A. Kuerno (guitar; aka Chris Paccou, a onetime sound engineer for Napalm Death and Carcass). After Donald Trump was elected president, Brujeria once again made him the subject of a song on the 2019 single \"Amaricon Czar\" (a number about Vladimir Putin, \"Lord Nazi Ruso,\" appeared on the flip side), while the global pandemic that swept the world informed the track \"COVID-666,\" issued in 2020. That track and \"Lord Nazi Ruso\" were recycled for Brujeria\\'s fifth album, 2023\\'s Esto Es Brujeria, which found the band sounding as hard and relentless as ever 30 years on from their debut. It also included a sludgy version of J.J. Cale\\'s \"Cocaine,\" which became a hit for Eric Clapton in 1977. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "\"This eccentric ‘grindcore' outfit formed in Liverpool, England, in 1985. Specializing in low-technology studio techniques, they went on to issue a sequence of albums for Peaceville, and, later, Necrosis. In each case, a distorted, bass-laden barrage was overridden by stomach-churning vocals that consciously lacked both finesse and cohesion. The band's initial line-up featured Simon (drums), Bruno (bass), Andy (guitar) and Jeff Walker (vocals) After recording a split-single with Generic, Jeff and Bruno left the band, with the former joining Carcass. Bruno was replaced by Dom, with all three members assuming vocal duties. Chaotic and extreme, Electro Hippies used their platform to chastise the whole recording industry. Their mantle was upheld in the first case by Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, for whom the band recorded a July 1987 session comprising nine tracks. Titles such as ‘Starve The City (To Feed The Poor)' and ‘Mega-Armageddon Death Part 3' summed up both their appeal and limitations. The Electro Hippies split-up in 1989.\"\n",

      "'Merging the heavy guitar assault of metal with the frantic tempos and lyrical rage of hardcore punk, Trap Them is a band that thrives on creative extremity. The band was formed in 2002 by vocalist Ryan McKenney (Backstabbers Inc.) and guitarist Brian Vincent Izzi (December Wolves), who shared an enthusiasm for uncompromising acts such as Entombed, Disfear, and Black Flag. The two friends began writing songs together using a drum machine, self-releasing an EP that sold out its first pressing of 100 copies at the merch table during a Backstabbers Inc. tour. By 2004, both McKenney and Izzi had parted ways with their other bands, and Trap Them cohered into a steady lineup with Derek Black on bass and Mike Sharp on drums. In early 2007, the group joined forces with Trash Art Records to release a 7\" vinyl EP, Cunt Heir to the Throne, quickly followed by a full-length album, Sleepwell Deconstructor. Trap Them toured heavily behind the album, which earned rave reviews in the underground press, and in the spring of 2007, noted hardcore label Deathwish Inc. signed the band. Tours with Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror preceded their sophomore LP, Seizures in Barren Praise, which arrived in late 2008. Uncompromising in both sound and approach, the band continued to tour heavily, remaining prolific enough to deliver both a new EP, 2010\\'s Filth Rations, and a third LP, Darker Handcraft, a year later. The album was their first release for Prosthetic Records, which would also handle 2014\\'s unrelenting Blissfucker. It was notable for being the first record to include new bassist Galen Baudhuin (Infera Bruo) and drummer Brad Fickeisen (No Salvation, the Red Chord), and was produced, once again, by Trap Them\\'s longtime collaborator Kurt Ballou of the band Converge.

The group was formed in Italy in the late '90s by Turilli and Staropoli. They recruited Daniele Carbonera to serve as their drummer. The band was already working on a debut, 1997's Legendary Tales, before they connected with Lione (known as Joe Terry during his time in the band Labyrinth), phoning him from the studio to arrange for him to join them.

Although they were only 14 at the time, the young bandmembers worked on original material, and by 1994 they had released two demos. These early recordings were sent out to various record companies to no avail. Steadfast in their convictions, they self-released their debut album, Savage Poetry, in 1995. It wasn't long before a record company showed interest, and they signed with AFM. The label was keen to distribute their debut, but Edguy chose to forge ahead with their follow-up instead. The resulting record, Kingdom of Madness, was released in 1997, with Storch departing shortly thereafter. He was replaced by drummer Frank Lindenthal for 1998's Vain Glory Opera, and the album upped their profile thanks to some notable guest spots from Hansi Kürsch (Blind Guardian) and Timo Tolkki (Stratovarius). The addition of drummer Felix Bohnke and bassist Tobias Exxel freed up Sammet to focus on vocals.They continued to produce a record a year, with Theater of Salvation arriving in 1999, while Sammet also worked on a metal-opera project, Avantasia. While he was busy with Avantasia, the other bandmembers re-recorded their self-released debut, which had become quite a rarity. The year 2001 marked their last studio record for AFM, Mandrake, which they followed up with the live album Burning Down the Opera Live. Edguy then signed to the independent record label Nuclear Blast, which put out the King of Fools EP in 2004. They continued to churn out records regularly during the next few years, with Hellfire Club appearing later in 2004, the Superheroes EP in 2005, and Rocket Ride in 2006.Sammet returned to his Avantasia project in 2007, but it wasn't long until the band was back in the studio recording Tinnitus Sanctus. Their first DVD release, Fucking with Fire: Live, arrived in 2009, and in 2011 they put out their ninth record, Age of the Joker.

The release was succeeded by “Astronomy” released in 2006: part science fiction concept album, and part an eclectic journey through different cosmological themes.With the 2011 release “Under the Grey Banner”, DRAGONLAND returned once more to their Tolkienesque roots with an all-out fantasy concept album, making complete the trilogy that is “The Dragonland Chronicles” saga.As foretold long ago by mumbling sages gazing upon constellations carved into the firmament: DRAGONLAND have returned, twenty years since their inception and ten years since their last album! Now, prepare your mind to speed through the heavens, where you shall in awe discover \"The Power of the Nightstar!\"'\n",

      "\"Kai Hansen formed Helloween in 1984, playing guitar and singing on the speed metal band's first four albums. He left in early 1989, however, and founded Gamma Ray with vocalist Ralf Scheepers (formerly with Tyran Pace). The duo intended to record a one-off project that Hansen originated while in Helloween, so they recruited bassist Uwe Wessel, drummer Matthias Burchardt, and several other musicians. The album, Heading for Tomorrow, was released in 1990 and proved a hit with fans and critics, so much so that Hansen, Scheepers, and Wessel decided to tour the album with added members Dirk Schlacter (guitar) and Uli Kusch (drums). During the tour the Heaven Can Wait EP was released. By 1991, Gamma Ray produced another album of new material, entitled Sigh No More. Following 1993's Insanity &amp; Genius, vocalist Scheepers departed to try out for Judas Priest; he didn't get the gig, but opted to form a new band called Primal Fear rather than return to the fold, leaving Hansen to take over vocal duties on 1995's Land of the Free. Further recordings with Hansen as lead vocalist followed, including 1997's Somewhere Out in Space, 1998's Valley of the Kings, and 1999's Power Plant. Blast from the Past was released in 2000. Gamma Ray returned to a raging New Wave of British Heavy Metal style for 2001's No World Order, and followed that album with the live set Skeleton in the Closet. Gamma Ray returned in 2005 with Majestic, the release of which was accompanied by a world tour. In 2007, Gamma Ray released Land of the Free II (the sequel to 1995's Land of the Free), and went on tour with Helloween to promote the album. Three years later, the band released its tenth full-length album, To the Metal! In 2012, drummer Daniel Zimmermann left the group after 15 years. He was replaced by Michael Ehre. The band released their eleventh studio album, Empire of the Undead, which took the band's sound in a more thrash-oriented direction, in the spring 2014. ~ John Bush, Rovi\"\n",

      "'A versatile and energetic English singer, songwriter, and musician, Bruce Dickinson is best known for his long tenure as lead vocalist for the iconic heavy metal outfit Iron Maiden. Since making his debut with the band in 1982 with the genre classic Number of the Beast, he has established himself, alongside contemporaries like Rob Halford and Ronnie James Dio, as one of the most acclaimed and instantly recognizable vocalists to emerge from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. He left the group in 1993 to pursue a solo career, leaving seven gold and platinum-selling LPs in his wake, but returned to the fold in 1999, where he would spend the next two decades adding exclamation points to the Iron Maiden legacy via late-career highlights like Brave New World and The Book of Souls. In addition to his work in music, Dickinson is also an entrepreneur, scriptwriter, and avid fencer, and he has authored a pair of comedic books (Lord Iffy Boatrace and The Missionary Position) as well as an autobiography (What Does This Button Do?), hosted U.K. radio shows, and is a certified airplane pilot -- he flies Iron Maiden\\'s private plane. Born Paul Dickinson on August 7, 1958, in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, he adopted the first name Bruce as a youngster for reasons unknown. Shortly after relocating to Sheffield as a teenager, Dickinson became enamored of such \\'70s heavy metal bands as Deep Purple, and after an attempt at becoming a drummer didn\\'t work out, he began singing in local bands -- Styx (not the American band of the same name), Speed, and Shots. But none of these bands broke out of regional status, something that would change when Dickinson fronted his next band, Samson. During his tenure with Samson, Dickinson went by the name Bruce Bruce. The band issued a pair of albums with Dickinson, including 1980\\'s Head On and 1981\\'s Shock Tactics, and while the bandmembers were part of the aforementioned NWOBHM movement, they failed to gain the popularity obtained by such fellow acts as Def Leppard, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden. Citing \"musical differences,\" Dickinson left the band in the summer of 1981 shortly after Samson appeared at the summer\\'s Reading Festival. Almost immediately after his exit from Samson, Iron Maiden\\'s singer Paul Di\\'Anno left the band despite being in the midst of a meteoritic rise to stardom. A tryout was arranged with Dickinson, who was named Iron Maiden\\'s new vocalist in late 1981. Several months after joining the group, Maiden released The Number of the Beast -- not only one of the best albums of their career, but an undisputed all-time heavy metal classic. With his powerful operatic vocals, the new Dickinson-led Maiden stormed the charts and arenas worldwide for the remainder of the decade -- solidifying their standing with such further acclaimed releases as 1983\\'s Piece of Mind, 1984\\'s Powerslave, 1985\\'s Live After Death, 1986\\'s Somewhere in Time, and 1988\\'s Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Despite Maiden\\'s massive success, rumors always circulated about Dickinson often butting heads with Maiden founder/bassist Steve Harris, and the release of Dickinson\\'s first ever solo album in 1990, Tattooed Millionaire, only intensified the speculation. But Dickinson returned to Maiden shortly thereafter, lending his vocal talents to 1990\\'s No Prayer for the Dying and 1992\\'s Fear of the Dark. While the band remained extremely popular in just about every area of the world, Maiden began losing its footing stateside, and sensing that the band\\'s best days were behind them, Dickinson left the group in 1993 after a farewell tour (several Dickinson-era live albums were issued by Iron Maiden around the same time -- A Real Live One, A Real Dead One, and Live at Donnington 1992). Maiden would soldier on with replacement vocalist Blaze Bayley (formerly of Wolfsbane), while Dickinson resumed his solo career, resulting in 1994\\'s Balls to Picasso, 1995\\'s Alive in Studio A, 1997\\'s Accident of Birth, 1998\\'s The Chemical Wedding, and 2005\\'s Tyranny of Souls. But like Bayley-era Maiden, Dickinson\\'s solo career failed to reach as wide of an audience as \\'80s Maiden had. Dickinson and Maiden patched up their differences by the late \\'90s, as he rejoined the group for a successful reunion tour in 1999, and a year later, for the album Brave New World and supporting tour. While Maiden was once again his top priority -- subsequent albums like Brave New World, Dance of Death, Final Frontier, and The Book of Souls continued to result in packed arenas -- Dickinson continued to focus on his solo career, with the compilation The Best of Bruce Dickinson arriving in 2001, followed by the full-length studio album Tyranny of Souls in 2005 -- BMG reissued all five of Dickinson\\'s solo efforts on vinyl in 2017. In 2018 Dickinson released the concert film Scream for Me Sarajevo, which chronicled a 1994 solo concert that took place while the Bosnian War was still raging and Sarajevo itself was under siege. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'Named for a warrior god in Finnish mythology, Turisas are a heavy metal band whose music is an ambitious blend of symphonic metal, power metal, progressive rock, and Finnish folk music. Turisas were formed in Hämeenlinna, a rural community in southern Finland, by vocalist Warlord Nygård and guitarist/bassist Jussi Wickström in 1997. Eager to perform their songs that blended pagan folklore with bloody tales of warfare, Nygård and Wickström recruited three likeminded musicians, percussionist Tude Lehtonen, keyboardist Antti Ventola, and guitarist Georg Laakso, but the epic-scale sound they sought proved difficult to capture on tape, and Turisas\\' first attempt at recording an album, 1998\\'s Taiston Tie (aka \"The Battle Path\"), never saw release due to the group\\'s dissatisfaction with the results. In 2000, a demo CD, The Heart of Turisas, was distributed to fans, the press, and industry professionals, and coupled with the group\\'s storming live show, word spread about the unusual band and Century Media signed the group to a recording contract in 2003. Turisas\\' first proper album, Battle Metal, recorded at studios in France and Finland, was released in mid-2004, with the band supporting the album with appearances at a number of major European metal festivals. In the fall of 2005, Laakso was involved in a severe auto accident that caused major injuries to his spinal cord, forcing him to leave the band. Wickström took over all guitar duties for the recording of Turisas\\' next album, 2007\\'s The Varangian Way, while Hannes Horma (bass), Olli Vänskä (violin), Janne Mäkinen (accordion), and Antti Laurila (accordion), four musicians who had helped fill out the group\\'s sound during live concerts, appeared on the disc as full-fledged bandmembers for the first time. A few months before The Varangian Way was to be released in the spring of 2007, Antti Ventola announced he had left Turisas in a post on the group\\'s online forum. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'Marduk\\'s unswerving commitment to blasphemy and extreme music, a catalog of well-regarded recordings, and a relentless touring schedule established them as one of Scandinavia\\'s best known black metal acts. Though they began as a Swedish death metal outfit, by 1992\\'s Dark Endless, their atmospheric debut album, they were already evolving sonically. 1996\\'s iconic Heaven Shall Burn...When We Are Gathered firmly established them in black metal circles. 2002\\'s World Funeral offered a left turn toward accessibility, and 2004\\'s Plague Angel marked a return to form. The conceptual scope of 2007\\'s Rom 5:12 was critically proclaimed a creative successor to Celtic Frost\\'s classic To Mega Therion. 2012\\'s Serpent Sermon showcased the band\\'s maturity and a forceful new production style. 2015\\'s acclaimed Frontschwein and 2018\\'s Viktoria were each followed by multiple live outings, EPs, box sets, and singles. Marduk released Memento Mori in 2023.The group formed under the leadership of guitarist Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson in 1990 with vocalist Andreas Axelsson, bassist Richard Kalm, and drummer Joakim Grave rounding out the lineup. Their name is drawn from an ancient Mesopotamian deity and the patron saint of Babylon. They began as more of a standard death metal band with a black metal influence but have come to be known for their style of extreme black metal, which tends to focus on themes of warfare and anti-Christian sentiment and is characterized by relentlessly fast drumming and blurred walls of guitar noise. They released their controversially titled demo tape Fuck Me Jesus in 1991. Soon after, a second guitarist was added, Devo Andersson, while Bogge Svensson replaced Kalm on bass. Using this lineup, Marduk recorded their debut studio album, Dark Endless for No Fashion Records. Unhappy with No Fashion, the band jumped to the French Osmose Productions, releasing Those of the Unlight in 1993, this time with Grave on drums as well as vocals and new bassist in B. War. For 1994\\'s Opus Nocturne, Fredrik Andersson was brought in on drums, Devo Andersson left, and Grave was resigned to vocals. (Meanwhile, Osmose set about re-releasing the Fuck Me Jesus demo in 1995 -- at the time it was banned in seven countries.) Lineup changes continued with Grave\\'s subsequent departure; he was replaced by Legion (ex-Opthalamia). This lineup issued their iconic, Heaven Shall Burn...When We Are Gathered in 1996. Universally acclaimed, the band quickly followed it with a live concert recording from the tour titled Germania. Its claim to fame among fans and doubters was that it conclusively proved that Marduk could sustain the nonstop, roaring blastbeat intensity on their records without studio trickery. 1998\\'s Nightwing was partly inspired by the life of Vlad Tepes, aka Dracula. 1999\\'s Panzer Division was a war-themed concept album, their final release for Osmose. After leaving the label, Marduk set up their own label, Blooddawn (distributed in the U.S. by Century Media), to release the double-live Infernal Eternal and the full-length studio set La Grande Danse Macabre, in 2001.Emil Dragutinovic replaced Andersson on drums in 2002. The following year Marduk released the more midtempo World Funeral. It was perceived by some fans, as well as critics, as an attempt to break into the mainstream. Devo returned to the band in 2004 as bassist; he played on Marduk\\'s blasphemous Plague Angel, a theme the band would continue on their 2007 follow-up, Rom 5:12. Following its release, critical and popular response to the latter album was unprecedented; many proclaimed it the aesthetic successor to Celtic Frost\\'s 1985 black metal classic, To Mega Therion.Wormwood, Marduk\\'s 11th album, appeared in 2009, followed shortly by Serpent Sermon in 2012. Both albums showcased a new, more dynamically forceful -- though far from polished -- production style, amplifying the band\\'s more extreme musical tendencies. The overt military themes on 2015\\'s Frontschwein harkened back to 1999\\'s Panzer Division. The following year, the band was forced to postpone their U.S. tour after being denied entry visas. Their militaristic lyrics and anti-Christian themes were cited as reasons. To fill the gap, Marduk -- on their Blooddawn Productions label -- issued two live albums (Strigzscara Warwolf and World Panzer Battle 1999), two studio EPs (Ancient Evil, The Sun Turns Black at Night) and two singles (\"Werwolf\" and \"Equestrian Bloodlust\"). When they were finally allowed to continue their tour in North America, a 2017 Oakland, California show was cancelled after the venue was targeted by Antifa protestors who opposed the band\\'s alleged sympathies for fascism. Undeterred, they soldiered on and returned to the studio. In May 2018, they released the 7\" single \"Panzer Division Live\" b/w \"Baptism by Fire,\" followed by the long-player Viktoria in June. The studio outing was a raw, back-to-basics black metal album that was more old-school than ever. 2019 saw the limited issue of The Official Bootleg Series, Vol. 1, a four-cassette boxed set containing two early albums and two EPS. They released Winged Death 1993, 7\" EP containing live versions of \"Wolves\" and \"On Darkened Wings.\" Bassist Devo left the band again in 2020 and was replaced by Joel Lindholm. Stalled by the pandemic\\'s rampage the world over, Marduk issued the live World Funeral: Jaws of Hell MMIII as a limited edition in October. In 2021, they released another archival concert date in Totentanz 2001. Marduk toured but were anxious to get back into the recording studio. In May 2023, during the band\\'s performance at Incineration Fest, bassist Lindolm was captured on a fan\\'s video giving a Nazi salute from the stage. The band fired him immediately and brought back Devo. In August they released Memento Mori. Produced and recorded by the band at Endarker Studios between September 2022 and March 2023, it marked Marduk\\'s first studio offering in five years. ~ William York &amp; Thom Jurek, Rovi'\n",

Its current lineup includes Mario Miron (guitar), Tia Vincent-Clark (bass) and Leo Didkovsky (drums). Celebrated for their fusion of sincere emotion, compositional complexity, stylistic daring and intense live energy, the band is simultaneously a medium and platform for drama and theology. It was founded in the context of Brooklyn DIY as a solo project by Hunt-Hendrix in 2005 while she was studying philosophy and classical composition at Columbia. After expanding to a quartet they made waves globally with their 2011 sophomore album Aesthethica for introducing the style of Scandinavian black metal into the world of experimental art rock. Their ambitious 2015 album The Ark Work was controversial for its incorporation of IDM and trap production into their musical language. In fall 2019 released their highly acclaimed fourth studio album H.A.Q.Q., which is tied to an ongoing philosophical YouTube lecture series.

      "'Swiss extreme metal group Samael quickly evolved from a run-of-the-mill black metal band into one of the most daring and eclectic sonic explorers of their generation; eager to tamper with their sound by introducing industrial, electronic, and gothic music elements into their formative black and death metal foundations. Formed in the late \\'80s by brothers Vorphalack (vocals/guitar) and Xytras (drums/programming/keyboards), along with bassist Masmiseim, Samael were initially influenced primarily by first-generation black metal bands such as England\\'s Venom, Sweden\\'s Bathory, and Swiss compatriots Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, as evidenced by their exceedingly raw, self-financed Medieval Prophecy EP. This brought them to the attention of France\\'s Osmose Productions, which offered to release the band\\'s first full-length album, Worship Him, in 1991. Characterized by spirited but unremarkable black metal graced with only minimal production values, the record did little to advance the band\\'s cause, but a shift into slower-paced, almost doom-like domains for the next year\\'s Blood Ritual better showcased Samael\\'s fast-expanding songwriting range, as well as their first experiments with synthesizer backdrops. After signing with the Century Media label and adding keyboard player Rodolphe H., the group entered the studio with up-and-coming producer Waldemar Sorychta and came away with their most accomplished and distinctive effort yet, 1994\\'s impressive Ceremony of Opposites, which was filled with evil atmospherics and keyboard melodies swirling around churning guitars to create what Samael themselves aptly called \"macabre operettas.\" The stakes were raised even higher on 1996\\'s groundbreaking Passage, where Xytras (by then simply known as Xy) took over keyboard duties as well as the daunting task of programming all his frequently hyperactive drum tracks. This unconventional mix of black metal brutality and synthesizers resulted in one of the decade\\'s most original extreme metal releases, and was followed by extensive touring, including the band\\'s first American shows. Such was Samael\\'s repute at the time that Xy was called on to produce two albums by labelmates Rotting Christ; but when the drummer rejoined his Samael bandmates to record 1999\\'s Eternal (featuring additional guitarist Kaos), inspiration seemed to be lacking. As would be the case with 2004\\'s belated follow-up, Reign of Light, Samael\\'s increasing obsession with electronic genres like house and trip-hop left little room for the balancing extreme metal elements of yore, and alienated both their record label (which released them from their contract) and primary fan base. But the members of Samael still made only a few concessions to guitar-driven heavy metal on their 2007 return to form, Solar Soul, and it wasn\\'t until their astonishing reversal into pure black metal blasphemy for 2009\\'s Above (initially recorded for release as a side project) that their original supporters had their longtime loyalty vindicated. In 2010, the band issued the single \"Antigod\" in anticipation of the release of their ninth studio long-player, Lux Mundi, which arrived the following year via Season of Mist. They made the move to Napalm for their tenth full-length, 2017\\'s Hegemony. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'Black Metal from Nannestad, Norway. More towards the ambient side of things. On the 15th of April 2009, Posthum released their self-titled debut album. The album was actually recorded twice, and though the first recording sounded very good, there was something unsatisfying about the energy within the album, resulting in a second recording, which became the actual release. Folter Records released the album, and 8 months later the band did their first European tour. «Lights Out» was released by Indie Recordings on September 21st, 2012. This album is the most experimental and ambient release from the band, and is considered the odd one among their albums. Two years later «The Black Northern Ritual» hit the shelves, a raw and more brutal sounding album, stripped of the ambient and more mellow parts of their latter release. On the 12th of April 2019, ten years after their debut was released, they release their 4th album «Like Wildfire», which is highly acclaimed by many reviewers and listeners. Posthum is trying to keep things interesting and unique with each release, and they have, from the very beginning, focused on full-length albums.

Led by vocalist/guitarist Helmuth Lehnerl, the band issued their debut album, The Last Supper, in 1995. Their overtly Satanic, European-style black metal eventually found favor overseas, resulting in a string of internationally charting efforts like Walpurgis Rites: Hexenwahn (2008), Blood Magick Necromance (2010), Conjuring the Dead (2014), and Totenritual (2017). Belphegor released their 12th studio album, Devils, in 2022.

They adopted the name Belphegor (one of the seven princes of Hell) in 1993 and issued a demo, Bloodbath in Paradise. Maxx left the group shortly after that, allowing Helmuth to take over vocal duties.

Blutsabbath (1997) and Necrodaemon Terrorsathan (2000) were released via Last Episode Records, and in 2003 Belphegor inked a deal with Napalm for their fourth studio long-player, Lucifer Incestus. Arriving in 2005, Goatreich-Fleshcult would be the band\\'s last outing for the label, as the following year saw them move to Nuclear Blast and issue Pestapokalypse VI –- by this time, Helmuth was the last original member remaining.

Both albums appeared on the German and Austrian charts, with the latter effort racking up sales in the U.S. Blood Magick Necromance (2011) followed a similar narrative path and was the first Belphegor release to chart in the United States. 2014\\'s acclaimed Conjuring the Dead, which Erik Rutan recorded at Mana Recording Studios in Florida, became the band\\'s highest-charting effort to date. The merciless and bludgeoning Totenritual appeared in 2017, followed by the equally unrelenting Devils, the extreme metal veterans\\' 12th long-player, in 2022. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia &amp; James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "\"One of the Czech Republic's first extreme metal bands, Maniac Butcher was formed in 1992, before Czechoslovakia's peaceful splintering, and went on to release a handful of albums and even more singles and mini-releases before crumbling toward the end of the decade. All of these contained only minor deviations from the misanthropic, obscure, and decidedly lo-fi black metal blueprint favored by many European underground metal bands of the '90s (Darkthrone, early Mayhem, etc.), and saw numerous part-time musicians collaborating with ever-present, corpse-painted duo, Barbarud Hrom (vocals) and Vlad Blasphemer (guitar, bass, drums). ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

      "'When attention first focused on Norway\\'s almost cartoonishly violent black metal scene in the mid-\\'90s, Mayhem were dubbed its godfathers, but most of the critical accolades were bestowed upon Emperor, whose musical innovations have had more impact on the genre than any other band. Norwegian black metal was rife with anti-Christian sentiment, but Emperor found novel ways of expressing it in their music; while their music could be furious and violent, the group was also influenced by the darkly majestic melodies of Norwegian folk and classical music, which very effectively supported their lyrical subject matter (even if it was frequently unintelligible). Emperor evoked not only Satanic horror, but also the frigid loneliness of bleak Scandinavian winters; additionally, images of pagan nature worship recalled an ancient, idealized pre-Christian past in which Scandinavian culture was one of the world\\'s most dominant (resulting in the sound being tagged \"Viking metal\" by some). However, even as Emperor\\'s music garnered world-wide acclaim in the heavy metal community, legal difficulties and lineup shifts ensued when a number of bandmembers became involved in the anti-Christian activism and general violence that characterized Norway\\'s underground metal scene at the time. Emperor\\'s original lineup featured vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist Ihsahn, bassist Mortiis (who has been credited with the band\\'s initial interest in Norwegian folk), and drummer Samoth; this trio recorded a demo, Wrath of the Tyrant, in late 1992, and soon added drummer Faust (born Bard G. Eithun), with Samoth switching to guitar. The quartet recorded a split EP with the band Enslaved titled Hordanes Land, after which Mortiis was forced to leave the group -- and the country -- for unspecified reasons; he moved to Sweden and pursued a solo career, often appearing costumed as an elf. New bassist Tchort signed on for Emperor\\'s full-length debut, In the Nightside Eclipse, which earned critical praise and an international cult following upon its release in 1994. However, around the same time, Samoth was convicted of arson after burning down a historical wooden church; Tchort was sentenced for burglary, knife assault, and desecration; and Faust was locked up for arson, burglary, and murder, stabbing a homosexual acquaintance 14 times outside the Olympic Park in Lillehammer after the man made a pass at him.After Samoth\\'s parole, Emperor regrouped with new bassist Alver and former Enslaved drummer Trym. A three-track EP, Reverence, was recorded in late 1996 as a precursor to 1997\\'s acclaimed Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, which refined and expanded on the accomplishments of the debut. Alver departed afterwards, leaving Ihsahn and Samoth to split bass chores on record; session bassist Tyr and keyboardist Charmand Grimloch began touring with the group to fill the holes. Emperor\\'s third album, IX Equilibrium, followed in 1999, and the following year the group issued its first concert recording, Emperial Live Ceremony. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Guitarists Infernus and Tormentor are the center of the Norwegian black metal outfit Gorgoroth, which took its name from the work of J.R.R. Tolkien. Despite numerous lineup changes, especially in the revolving-door rhythm section, Gorgoroth's basic, few-frills take on the trademark Norwegian sound remained fairly steady, and the group eventually managed to land an international deal with Nuclear Blast. The band's origins date back to 1993, the year its first demo was recorded; the original lineup featured vocalist Hat, bassist Kjettar, and drummer Goat Pervertor. Samoth, of Norwegian black metal legends Emperor, played bass on the group's official debut, Pentagram, which was released on the small Malicious label later that year. As the follow-up Antichrist was being recorded, various personnel turnovers ensued; by the time the dust settled and the album was released in 1995, vocalist Pest had joined up, Frost of Satyricon had temporarily taken over the drum post, and bassist Storm became part of the live lineup. For 1997's Under the Sign of Hell, bassist Ares (of Aeturnus) and drummer Grim (also of Borknagar) joined, and the latter was quickly replaced by another member of Aeturnus, Vrolok. Destroyer, Gorgoroth's first album for Nuclear Blast, appeared in 1998, featuring another guest appearance by Frost plus new bassist T-Reaper and guest synth player Daimonion. Nuclear Blast reissued the band's first three albums internationally in 1999; the following year, Gorgoroth returned with Incipit Satan, featuring vocalist Gaahl, bassist King Ov Hell, and drummer Sgt.

      "\"The story of Këkht Aräkh started at the end of 2018, in Mykolaiv, the southern city of Ukraine. However, the roots of the project take us back to Aug 2014 when the sole mastermind behind the project — Dmitry Marchenko — finished his very first song for his very first black metal act called Yokai.Although he had always been a huge fan of the genre, he felt like the version of black metal that he wanted to hear didn't exist yet. Even his favorite black metal songs he felt were lacking in some aspects. That is why he decided to try it for himself, excluding some aspects of the genre and replacing it with something else - an approach that would help the project that is Këkht Aräkh become original in its own right.After dozens of songs recorded as Yokai, Dmitry felt like taking the project to a new level, making it public and more meaningful. This was the point where some rebranding was needed and Këkht Aräkh came to be. Këkht references the Irish god of healing, Dian Cécht, and Aräkh references the Cambodian poisoning god, Arak Kol, with the word arak itself standing for evil spirit (usually female) in Cambodian mythology.His first release as Këkht Aräkh was Through the Branches to Eternity EP (2018), then debut album Night &amp; Love (2018) and sophomore Pale Swordsman (2021) all of which put a spotlight on the project as an exciting new form of black metal - raw and aggressive yet melancholic and tender with romantic gothic sensibilities throughout.\"\n",

And now, the ever-productive duo of Nocturno and Fenriz continue their own metallic saga with a new selection of fine, vintage sounding headbanging classics in the making.Carried on the brisk wind of eager rock, with foundations in black, thrash, doom and heavy metal, ‘Astral Fortress' is the latest album of stellar, eclectic old metal in the Darkthrone odyssey.

      "\"Burzum is the one-man project of Varg Vikernes (born Christian Vikernes, aka Count Grishnackh), perhaps the most notorious figure in Norwegian black metal. Although Burzum had an unpredictably experimental bent -- encompassing black metal, industrial, electronic, and dark ambient music -- Vikernes will forever be associated with his conviction for the 1993 murder of former Mayhem bandmate Euronymous. It wasn't the first time Vikernes had run afoul of the law; he had been a suspect in arsons directed at historic Norwegian churches in Bergen, a perception not helped by his use of a post-fire photograph of the Fantoft Kirke church on the cover of Burzum's 1993 Aske EP. Coupled with Vikernes' racist, virulently anti-Judeo-Christian beliefs was a sort of nationalistic pride, a longing to return to the pre-Christian pagan culture and religion that had marked the glory days of the Vikings; this paganism became a frequently recurring theme in black metal circles, and led to the Norwegian metal sound being tagged Viking metal in some quarters.As for his recording career, Vikernes issued the eponymous Burzum debut in 1992 under his Count Grishnackh alias (taken from a J.R.R. Tolkien book); it was largely a typical black metal record, although it featured a few synth dabblings and slower passages, neither of which had yet found much favor on the scene. Released in 1993, Det Som Engang Var expanded on those innovations while retaining an overall metal flavor. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss (If the Light Takes Us), issued in 1994 shortly after Vikernes' imprisonment, integrated synthesizers more fully into the Burzum sound, and the all-electronic closing track foreshadowed Burzum's later move into dark ambient. The well-received industrial/electronic-tinged Filosofem appeared in 1996, although it had been recorded (but not mixed) prior to Vikernes' incarceration.With the vaults thus exhausted, Burzum's future appeared to be in doubt, but Vikernes managed to begin recording entirely instrumental synthesizer albums while in prison. A concept work recounting a well-known Norse myth, Daudi Baldrs (Balder's Death), was released in 1997 as the first installment of a planned trilogy. The second portion, the mythology-themed Hlidskjalf, appeared in 1999, featuring an equipment upgrade and a correspondingly fuller sound. This would be the last Burzum release for nearly a decade until, in 2009, Vikernes was paroled after serving 15 years of a 21-year sentence. He began working on new material, and made a return to a more metal sound with 2010's Belus. Staying productive, Burzum went in a more experimental direction, releasing Fallen early in 2011 before following up later that year with From the Depths of Darkness, which featured re-recorded versions of songs from his early albums Burzum and Det Som Engang Var. The spring of 2012 saw the release of Burzum's Umskiptar. He followed the next year with the increasingly courtly and ambient Sôl Austan, Mâni Vestan, and again in 2014 with the similarly styled The Ways of Yore. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Norway\\'s Ulver took their name from the Norse word for \"wolf.\" As a unit, they are one of the most diverse groups in North European music. Though initially regarded as a black metal band, they have worked in numerous genres -- all dependent on predetermined concepts -- rendering them an entity unto themselves. Active since 1994, early recordings like Bergtatt -- a ferocious, blasting, buzzing, blackened masterpiece -- they immediately shifted gears with the completely acoustic Kveldssanger and the recorded-in-a-field Nattens Madrigal, confounding fans and critics, but enthralling them simultaneously. In the 21st century, they experimented with electro-acoustic music on Perdition City, ambient soundtracks such as Lyckantropen Themes, Svidd Neger, and Riverhead, large-scale works such as Messe I.X-VI.X (with the Tromsø Chamber Orchestra), extrapolations of Krautrock (ATGCLVLSSCAP), and gothic-influenced pop on The Assassination of Julius Caesar.Led by vocalist Garm (Kristoffer Rygg), Ulver recorded three albums that created a trilogy and spawned a global reputation for stylistic unpredictability. The first, 1995\\'s Bergtatt, was a black metal offering that detailed a Norse legend in which maidens are abducted by denizens of the underworld. Their second offering, Kveldssanger, issued a year later, employed classical guitars, strings, and a chamber choir as they performed original folk and classical dirges. Ulver made their international debut with the final entry in their trilogy: 1997\\'s Nattens Madrigal. An album about wolves, it brought them full-circle. It was intentionally under-produced and performed in traditional Norwegian black metal style.In late 1997, Garm began working with keyboardist, sound conceptualist, and composer Tore Ylwizaker, who formally joined the band. Together they created the strategy for Themes from William Blake\\'s the Marriage of Heaven &amp; Hell, which was issued in 1998. The album initially proved a head scratcher for fans since it transcended black metal\\'s aesthetics and employed everything from ambient and classical sounds to industrial, prog metal, and art rock, but was eventually regarded as one of their finest moments.The Metamorphosis EP, the first of their electronic \"ambient soundtracks\" works, was released in 1999, followed by four records of the same type in quick succession: their fifth album, Perdition City (Music to an Interior Film) in 2000, and three EPs: Silence Teaches You How to Sing and Silencing the Singing, both in 2001, and 2003\\'s A Quick Fix of Melancholy.In 2005, Ulver released Blood Inside, their sixth full-length, and an album that marked a return to standard rock instrumentation, combined with orchestral instruments and arrangements. Their seventh studio album, Shadows of the Sun, saw another sonic sea change. Ulver enlisted guitarist and producer Christian Fennesz and Theremin master Pamelia Kurstin as collaborators. The release received the Album of the Year Award at the Oslo Awards.In 2009, Ulver announced they would become a quartet. Their three extant members -- Garm, Ylwizaker, and multi-instrumentalist Jørn H. Sværen -- enlisted British composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O\\'Sullivan, who joined the group. The first album to feature the quartet was 2011\\'s Wars of the Roses, followed by a thoroughly reimagined collection of \\'60s cover versions on 2012\\'s Childhood\\'s End, and an EP from the Roadburn Festival, as well as a DVD of a performance at the Norwegian National Opera. Also that year, Ulver received a commission for a new work from the KulturHuset Tromsø in Norway, in cooperation with the Arctic Opera and Philharmonic Orchestra. Entitled Messe I.X-VI.X, it was performed and recorded by the band (with new member Ole Alexander Halstensgård replacing O\\'Sullivan) with the Tromsø Chamber Orchestra. The original recordings underwent post-production work with orchestral arranger Martin Romberg, and were finally released in the fall of 2013. Also in 2013, Ulver collaborated on a full-length recording with Sunn 0))); it was released as Terrestrials in February of 2014. That same month, the band played a series of shows that consisted \"...of partly new and improv-based material, likely to revolve around motifs already familiar to our familiars.\" The following year, they announced that O\\'Sullivan -- under the nom de plume \"12\" -- had taken the multi-track tapes of those shows and massively edited them. Rygg, Ylwizaker, Sværen, and Anders Møller added new studio material to them during subsequent months. The full project, titled ATGCLVLSSCAP, was issued in 2016 on House of Mythology. An original score and soundtrack for the film Riverhead appeared in December 2016 and continued along the improvisational path. In March 2017, Ulver managed to shock fans and critics yet again by heading into radical directions with the release of the dark synth pop single and video for \"Nemoralia.\" In an interview, Rygg called the full-length The Assassination of Julius Caesar \"Ulver\\'s pop album.\" Issued in April, it preceded the band\\'s appearance at the annual Roadburn Festival. The set included guest spots by saxophonist Nik Turner (ex-Hawkwind) and guitarist Stian Westerhus. The following year, Ulver released the Sic Transit Gloria Mundi EP, comprised of two recently completed songs whose original demos were left on the cutting-room floor during The Assassination of Julius Caesar sessions, and a cover of Frankie Goes to Hollywood\\'s \"The Power of Love.\" In June of 2020, Ulver announced the release of full-length The Flowers of Evil, and the imminent publication of Wolves Evolve: The Ulver Story, a hardbound 336-page biography. An aesthetic follow-up to The Assassination of Julius Caesar, it showcased a deeper move into the \"doom dance\" sound of its predecessor, with return production from Michael Rendall and Martin \"Youth\" Glover. The album and the book were released in August. ~ Thom Jurek, Rovi'\n",

      "\"In true Enslaved fashion, the Bergen voyagers' 16th album, Heimdal, is both a departure and a communion with roots forged over three decades ago in the turbulent birth throes of Norway's black metal scene. Founded in 1991 by the then precociously young Ivar Bjørnson and Grutle Kjellson, Enslaved were determined to set out on a different course from their Satanic, church-burning peers, turning their attention towards Viking lore and writing the majority of the lyrics for their 1994 debut album, Vikingligr Veldi, in Icelandic for its proximity to Old Norse.2020's Utgard album was the beginning of a new phase for the band, delving deeper into the esoteric nature of Nordic mythology, but finding more precise jump-off points for a leap into the unknown. More streamlined than its multi-layered predecessors, In Times and E, if only to prise open new expanses to explore, its ruminations on the shadowy, titular land of the Norse Jotun ice giants found parallels with the psychological states of the unconscious, and the pilgrimage into our own hearts of darkness that's the start of the route to all self-knowledge. Heimdal offers another tangential act of discovery, another embarkation point for a solemn, expectant and exhilarating passage through the realms of the senses. It's a reflection of paths travelled, a promise of a new beginning, and a rite of passage between the two. Truly an album for all times.\"\n",

      "'Hailing from Norway\\'s Sogndal region, Windir (meaning \"Primal Warrior\") combined the vicious fury of black metal with Scandinavia\\'s rich folk music, history, and mythology. Masterminded in 1994 by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Terje \"Valfar\" Bakken, Windir issued a couple of demos before debuting with 1997\\'s Sóknardalr, on which Steingrim played drums and Steinarson provided clean vocals sung in the Sognamål dialect. Unveiled two years later, their second effort, Arntor, was a full-fledged concept album inspired by a local warrior legend of the same name, but unlike its predecessor, compositions were now sung in English, with an eye for the international market. Following its release to generally rave reviews, Valfar decided to properly flesh out Windir for the purpose of performing live, and guitarists Strom and Sture, keyboardist Righ, and bassist Hvàll were added in time for 2001\\'s 1184. Clean vocals were handled by one Cosmocrator this time out, and though still thematically steeped in regional Norse subject matter, Windir\\'s folk music leanings also took a noticeable back seat here, making way for a return to more cohesively metallic direction -- also utilized on the band\\'s fourth effort, 2003\\'s formidable Likferd. The latter, especially, was termed an unmitigated triumph by the worldwide press, and the future seemed incredibly bright for Windir, but on January 14, 2004, Valfar set out on foot for his family\\'s secluded cabin at Fagereggi and never arrived.

Needless to say, this tragic event sadly spelled the end for Windir, whose remaining members solemnly organized a benefit concert to celebrate their lost leader, as well as a final CD (2004\\'s Valfar, Ein Windir) containing Windir outtakes and leftovers meant to raise funds for Valfar\\'s family. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Finland's Beherit (the Syriac name for Satan, incidentally) was spawned in 1989 by spectacularly named vocalist/guitarist Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance. Along with bassist Black Jesus and drummer Sodomatic Slaughter, his express purpose was to perform the most primitive, savage, hell-obsessed black metal imaginable (no Viking themes to be found here). Clearly influenced by the blunt, unrefined sonic standards heard on Bathory's early efforts, Beherit's heavily traded demo tapes provided the bulk material for their 1991 debut, The Oath of Black Blood. Arguably Finland's first full-fledged black metal album, it preceded their by now far more legendary peers Impaled Nazarene by a year. Like other lo-fi black metal outfits, Beherit's commercial intractability, frightening visuals, and outrageous live performances (including the occasional goat on-stage) begat a small but extremely dedicated cult following, which readily snapped up subsequent releases such as Werewolf, Semen and Blood, Messe des Morts, and Drawing Down the Moon. 1994's enigmatic H418ov21.C inaugurated a wholly different phase for the band (now whittled down to a lone Holocausto), characterized by the ambient synth collages of darkwave and leading to 1996's similar Electric Doom Synthesis. Beherit quietly vanished soon thereafter, but 1999's Beast of Beherit compilation was eventually released to commemorate the band's important contributions to the black metal field. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

      "'First formed as \"Dolmen\" in 1989 by Shaftiel (vocals/guitar/bass) and Equitant Ifernain (lead guitar, bass), the black/death metal band Absu hails from the least likely of extreme metal watering grounds: Dallas, Texas. By 1991, the name change to Absu (borrowed from ancient Mesopotamian beliefs) had taken effect, two demos, \"Immortal Sorcery\" and \"Return of the Ancients\" were in the can, and independent Gothic Records was showing interest in the self-proclaimed \"mythological occult metal\" group. Drummer/vocalist Proscriptor (a.k.a. Russ R. Givens) joined shortly after the release of the following year\\'s The Temples of Offal E.P., and his academic lyrics and songwriting began to dominate the band, starting with 1993\\'s full-length debut Barathrum. Absu then signed with France\\'s famed Osmose Productions, which issued their subsequent efforts, Sun of Tiphareth (1995), ...And Shineth Unto the Cold Cometh (E.P., 1995), The Third Storm of Cythraul (1997), and In the Eyes of Ioldánach (E.P., 1998). Each of these displayed increasingly elaborate studies of obscure mysticism (Sumerian, Gaelic, you name it!), and, and led to tours with the likes of Impaled Nazarene and Enslaved, helping Absu carve a position of huge respect within black metal circles. 2001\\'s long-awaited Tara focused on Celtic legend and obtained even greater acclaim, but was the last to feature longtime member Equitant. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'The unholy Austrian black metal combo Abigor was formed in 1993 by T.T., P.K., and Tharen. After recording several demos, Tharen was replaced by Silenius with whom the band recorded yet another demo entitled \"Hate &amp; Sin\" just prior to being signed by Napalm Records. In 1994, their debut album Verwustung / Invoke the Dark Age was released. This powerful debut quickly established Abigor as serious and credible black metal, separating them from the truckloads of bands that were popping up all over the world in the wake of the antics and hype of the Scandinavian scene. Abigor has been a very prolific band over the years, releasing eight CDs between 1994 and 2000. Highlights include the 1995 album Nachthymnen (From the Twilight Kingdom), and the 1996 two-part epic Opus IV, which is a combination of two chapters, \"Horns Lurk Beyond the Stars\" and \"Blut Aus Aeonen,\" recorded in late 1995 and early 1996. The band\\'s lineup remained stable up until the 1999 release, Channeling the Quintessence of Satan, on which the vocals of Silenius, who went on to form Summoning, were replaced with Thurisaz. Then in 2000 T.T. left the band due to personal differences with the other members and was replaced by Moritz Neuner. The trio went on to record an EP entitled In Memory as well as the album Satanized (A Journey Through Cosmic Infinity) which was released in March of 2001. ~ Kevin Odle, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Inspired by Scandinavian one-man black metal entrepreneurs like Bathory's Quorthon, Burzum's Count Grishnackh, and the ubiquitous Mortiis, San Francisco native Jef Whitehead adopted the nom de guerre Wrest in 1998 and soon began self-recording and releasing demos under the Leviathan heading. Within five years, these already numbered more than a dozen and were partly compiled on 2002's Verräter collection; but Leviathan continued to favor short-form demos, EPs, and split releases (with the likes of Crebain, Xasthur, and Sapthuran) in the years that followed, only committing to full-length efforts with 2003's The Tenth Sub-Level of Suicide and 2004's Tentacles of Whorror. Wrest has also contributed his undead vocal talents to albums by Sunn 0))). In 2005, Wrest formed Twilight, a black metal supergroup, with members of other iconic bands (Xasthur, Krieg, Isis, Nachtmystium, and Sonic Youth), releasing three albums (2005's self-titled, 2010's Monument to Time End, and III: Beneath Trident's Tomb in 2014). At the same time Twilight was formed, Wrest released an album under the Leviathan moniker: the collection of demos Howl Mockery at the Cross. The next year, he released a two-EP combo -- Speed of Darkness and The Blind Wound -- the latter of which was a re-release of a split album with Sapthuran. Fourth album Massive Conspiracy Against All Life came in 2008. In 2011, inspired by events surrounding a sexual assault and domestic violence charge, Wrest released True Traitor, True Whore. Afterward, he moved to Portland, Oregon, started his own label (Profound Lore), a tattoo business, and a family. Four years later, his critically acclaimed sixth album, Scar Sighted, birthed another dose of darkness into the music world. In 2016, Dutch label Hammerheart offered deluxe reissues of Leviathan's first four albums along with the 2005 compilation A Silhouette in Splinters. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia &amp; Neil Z.

      "'Musically and visually, Oslo\\'s 1349 have roots deeply implanted in the second wave of Norwegian black metal. Their sound, complete with buzzing (rather than roaring) guitars, abundant blastbeats, Satanic lyrics, unclean vocals etc., is appended by ghastly corpse-paint, leather, spikes, fire breathing, and more on-stage. Early recordings, such as Liberation, and Beyond the Apocalypse, were drenched in lo-fi production, but won fans due to a sometimes-overwhelming physicality and aggression. Though hardly prolific -- they\\'ve issued less than ten albums in 22 years -- they are one of the few surviving entities from the era who continue releasing material and touring, while remaining -- with only two exceptions -- close to their sonic and aesthetic origins, as evidenced by 2014\\'s Massive Cauldron of Chaos. 1349 took their name from the year in which the black death epidemic arrived on Scandinavian shores. Born in 1997 from the remains of black metal quartet Alvheim, 1349 featured vocalist and drummer Olav \"Ravn\" Bergene, guitarist André \"Tjalve\" Kvebek, and bassist Tor Risdal \"Seidemann\" Stavenes. Second guitarist Idar \"Archaon\" Burheim would join two years later, in time to perform on 1349\\'s second demo (titled \"Chaos Preferred\") in 2000, and the ensuing eponymous 2001 EP, which established the band\\'s sound as a single-minded throwback to the devastating style of black metal that made Norway the movement\\'s focal point in the early \\'90s. 1349 made another connection to that seminal period when they recruited Satyricon drummer Kjetil Vidar \"Frost\" Haraldstad -- to allow vocalist Ravn to roam free on-stage -- which contributed to the band\\'s burgeoning reputation both as players and as performers, thanks to the usual black metal accoutrements. A trio of career-affirming albums followed, namely 2003\\'s Liberation, 2004\\'s Beyond the Apocalypse, and 2005\\'s Hellfire, paving the way for a U.S run (with a different drummer since Frost was denied entry due to a criminal record) supporting the reunited Celtic Frost, and a few years of dedicated touring and major European festival appearances. In 2006, Tjalve left the band to pursue other projects. After several years off, 1349 got back to the business of recording via 2009\\'s Revelations of the Black Flame album. It marked a radical departure in their sound. Produced in partnership with Celtic Frost icon Thomas Gabriel Fischer, he replaced much of the band\\'s old-school black metal with slower ambient and semi-industrial sounds, outraging most fans. The band added guitarist Secthdamon for the purpose of touring. The following year\\'s Demonoir, with only the original quartet, made only token efforts to redress the situation (with numerous atmospheric pieces sprinkled amid the more typical black metal songs) and further polarized 1349\\'s audience, leaving many unanswered questions as to the band\\'s future prospects. Secthdamon returned as a touring member in 2016, and remains part of the live outfit, as does drummer Nils Fjellström, who replaces Frost for U.S. tours. After four years of working on concert and festival stages, they returned to the studio and issued the Dødskamp EP in April of 2019, followed by a second EP in August, Through Eyes of Stone. Both recordings were back-to-basics affairs and were greeted by fans with enthusiasm. That October 1349 released their seventh full-length, The Infernal Pathway. Engineered by Jarrett Pritchard, the set contained guest lyrics by Kenneth \"Destroyer\" Svartalv, (Nocturnal Breed\\'s bassist/lyricist S.A. Destroyer) on all but one song. The album was celebrated by critics and fans alike as a welcome return to traditional form. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'Originally formed as a duo in 2010, Deafheaven, now a quintet, are a restless and experimental metal band from San Francisco. Often referred to as black metal, the group finds the term limiting, and sees the metal subgenre as a prime inspiration. Their ever-evolving sound includes elements of black metal, shoegaze, post-rock, and even accessible -- but musically challenging -- arena rock, as evidenced by albums such as 2013\\'s Sunbather and the punchier, more dynamic New Bermuda two years later. 2018\\'s Ordinary Corrupt Human Love wed somewhat gentler and more experimental and cinematic songwriting to their established black metal roots. Their fifth studio album, 2021\\'s Infinite Granite, was their least metal-influenced record yet, leaning closer to dream pop, ambient, and alternative rock.Initially made up of George Clarke (vocals) and Kerry McCoy (guitars), the band has a sound that blends black metal with elements of shoegaze, adding a layer of warmth to the genre\\'s typically icy sound while expanding the emotional range outside of the typical themes of death, despair, and hopelessness. As a duo, Clarke and McCoy wrote and recorded a demo on their own that would get the attention of Converge frontman Jacob Bannon\\'s label, Deathwish Inc., which released the untitled EP in 2010. The pair expanded the lineup to include guitarist Nick Bassett, bassist Derek Prine, and drummer Trevor Deschryver, who appeared on Deafheaven\\'s 2011 full-length debut, Roads to Judah, before parting ways with the band the following year. Looking to get back to their roots a bit, McCoy and Clarke worked on the writing for their follow-up album as a duo again, though they would recruit drummer Daniel Tracy to join them in the studio for the recording process. The result was their sophomore effort, Sunbather, which was released to critical acclaim in the summer of 2013. Recruiting new bassist Stephen Clark and guitarist Shiv Mehra, Deafheaven toured across the globe extensively as a quintet, including gigs with Between the Buried and Me, Pallbearer, No Joy, and many others. In 2015, Deafheaven signed to Anti- for the release of their highly anticipated third album, New Bermuda. Produced by frequent collaborator Jack Shirley, it arrived in early October. The set reached number 16 on the Top Rock Albums charts, and was supported by lengthy international tours. Its critical and commercial success brought it to the ears of listeners not normally enamored of heavy metal. In late 2017, Deafheaven de-camped to 25th St. Recording in Oakland with Shirley again listed as producer. By their own admission, they expanded their heavy, kinetic sound by adding psychedelia-inspired vocals, jazzy percussion, and intricate organic piano melodies to juxtapose against their trademark black metal-inspired and post-hardcore trademark sonics. Ordinary Corrupt Human Love took its title from Graham Greene\\'s novel The End of the Affair, reflecting a theme of yearning romanticism. The set\\'s first single and video, \"Honeycomb,\" was issued in April of 2018, and clocked in at nearly 12 minutes. While the video images showed glimpses of Deafheaven in the studio and wandering around San Francisco, the song\\'s lyrics actually referenced the work of Argentine novelist Julio Cortázar. The full-length was released in May. The singer/songwriter Chelsea Wolfe guested on the track \"Near.\" In 2020, the band planned a ten-year anniversary tour that had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To celebrate the occasion anyway, Deafheaven released 10 Years Gone (Sargent House) in December, a live-in-studio recording of their planned touring set. In addition to revitalizing long-established crowd favorites such as \"Vertigo\" and \"Kettle,\" they also included a recording of \"Daedalus,\" the first song the band ever wrote together. Infinite Granite, the band\\'s fifth studio album, arrived in 2021. A departure from their previous albums, Infinite Granite featured barely any screaming or metal riffs, instead featuring swirling guitars and clean vocals reflecting influences including Radiohead, Ride, Tears for Fears, and Chet Baker. ~ Gregory Heaney &amp; Thom Jurek, Rovi'\n",

      "'Maintaining a certain sense of mystery in black metal is hardly a novel idea, but even the Ukraine\\'s Drudkh (Sanskrit for \"wood\") take it to a somewhat more puzzling extreme, not printing lyrics in a majority of their released work, being shown in photos, or granting any interviews at all. Formed in Kharkiv in 2002, the project was begun by Hate Forest and Dark Ages member Roman Saenko (guitars and bass), fellow Hate Forest member and Astrofaes vocalist and keyboardist Thurios, and Lucifugum member Yuriy Sinitsky (drums and keyboards). The band drew some criticism from some quarters for embracing arguably \"nationalistic\" causes, but Drudkh argued that they were merely acting in a politically and culturally \"conservative\" manner -- however that may be interpreted is up to the beholder. Political leanings aside, the band surely was responsible for furthering the ideals of Ukrainian culture and mythology through a atmospheric black metal filter, featuring folk-based music with direct and indirect lyrical inspiration from some of their nation\\'s most prominent poets, such as Taras Shevchenko. Their first album -- Forgotten Legends -- first emerged from the band in early 2003. An expansive record, it acted as the blueprint for album number two, Autumn Aurora, which was released in 2004. The main difference this time around, however, was the use of markedly less traditional instruments, such as electronic keyboards and synthesizers. While Drudkh were notorious for not printing their lyrics, as mentioned above, they did make the texts of their next album, 2005\\'s The Swan Road, available, due in all probability to the fact that all of the album\\'s words were taken -- in some measure -- from the poet Shevchenko. More Ukrainian poets -- in addition to more Shevchenko -- were featured on album number four, 2006\\'s Blood in Our Wells, which -- like much of the band\\'s work -- was released on the Supernal label. While releasing two albums in one year may seem like a relic from rock &amp; roll days past, Drudkh managed exactly that in 2006, pairing the more progressive black metal-leaning Blood in Our Wells with October of that year\\'s next collection, the decidedly Ukrainian folk record Songs of Grief and Solitude. There was no need to raise a fuss about the lack of lyrics on the latter album of 2006, as it had no lyrics. Featuring a myriad of wind instruments and minimal percussion, the album marked a departure from the more traditional aspects of even a genre as malleable as black metal. A limited (999 copies) edition EP followed in 2007 -- entitled Anti-Urban -- which marked for the band a return to more \"metal\" territory, and 2007 also saw the release of a full-length album, Estrangement. Again, the band, which kept a fairly steady and full work schedule, was back in the studio soon after the album\\'s release to work on album number seven. ~ Chris True, Rovi'\n",

      "'France\\'s Blut aus Nord offer an idiosyncratic vision of black metal at once loud, dissonant, and intense, as well as gloomy, haunting, and melodic. Their constants are musical experimentation and evolution. They employ everything from medieval liturgical music and gothic folk to noisy progressive metal, industrial electronics, and more. That experimental approach was taken for 1996\\'s Memoria Vetusta I: Fathers of the Icy Ages and garnered an international fan base. 2003\\'s The Work Which Transforms God ecstatically proved to be the first wholly industrial black metal album. 2008\\'s Memoria Vetusta II: Dialogue with the Stars and 2014\\'s Memoria Vetusta III: Saturnian Poetry offered striking stylistic variances to their earlier output, while the 2011-2012 trilogy 777: Sect(s), 777: The Desanctification, 777: Cosmosophy stood apart conceptually. 2018\\'s Deus Salutis Meæ engaged with post-punk and 2019\\'s Hallucinogen connected melodic black metal to futurist psychedelia. 2022\\'s Disharmonium: Undreamable Abysses offered an aesthetic return to vanguard black metal and industrial sonics. Its sequel, Disharmonium: Nahab, arrived in 2023.Blut aus Nord is the creation of Vindsval, a singer/guitarist who got the ball rolling in Mondeville, France in 1993. At first, it was known as Vlad -- as in Vlad the Impaler -- and for a few years, Vindsval was more of a project than an actual band. Thanks to technology and a thing called overdubbing, Vindsval was able to record two demos by himself as Vlad (In the Mist in 1993 and Yggdrasil in 1994) and function as a \"one-man band\" in the studio. After about a year, Vindsval changed his project\\'s name from Vlad to Blut aus Nord, and when labels started showing some interest, Vindsval began to employ some other musicians, gradually turning the project into an actual band. After working with various session players on Blut aus Nord\\'s albums, Vindsval ended up with a regular lineup that consisted of himself on lead vocals and guitar, Ghost on bass, and W.D. Feld on drums and keyboards.Ultima Thulle, Blut aus Nord\\'s first official full-length album, was released in 1995 on Impure Creation Records (a small French label that later changed its name to Velvet Music International). Subsequent European releases included 1996\\'s Memoria Vetusta I: Fathers of the Icy Age (ICR) and 2002\\'s The Mystical Beast of Rebellion. None of those \\'90s or early-2000s discs were released in the United States -- they were only sold in North American stores as imports -- but in 2004, Blut aus Nord finally enjoyed North American distribution when The Work Which Transforms God, which had come out in Europe a year earlier, was released in the U.S. by Candlelight, a British label with an office in the Philadelphia suburbs. Due to critical and commercial success (relative to black metal, of course), Blut aus Nord\\'s back catalog was reissued in the United States in 2004 and 2005. Beginning with 2005\\'s Thematic Emanation of Archetypal Multiplicity mini-album, their material became increasingly experimental, relying on layers of textured, industrial, and ambient sounds as well as a more open musical environment. Indeed, 2006\\'s MoRT was considered -- even by many fans -- to leave the realm of black metal entirely and become alternative with its elongated dissonant tones, shimmering backdrops, murky vocals, and deliberate absence of blastbeats. While the album was heralded by many for its innovation, it was considered too far off the beaten path for some. They furthered their experimental reputation with the decidedly heavier Odinist: The Destruction of Reason by Illumination in 2007 and with 2008\\'s near-progressive Dialogue with the Stars. In 2009, the band re-released Dialogue as a double-disc package with a brand-new record, a follow-up of sorts to Memoria Vetusta I, simply entitled Memoria Vetusta II. Listening to both recordings, it\\'s easy to hear that Blut aus Nord had created a new, all but trademarked form of extreme avant-rock. The band began to issue experimental EPs in their \"Existential Series\" scheduled to run parallel to their main body of work. The first one, What Once Was... Liber I, initially appeared as a limited edition in 2010. The idea was taken to the next level with a trilogy of album-length recordings set around the number 777. The pummeling 777 Sect(s) (allegedly the long-rumored sequel to The Work Which Transforms God) was issued in April of 2011, followed in November by 777: The Desanctification, a much more atmospheric and ambient -- yet no less blackened -- series entry in November of that year. What Once Was... Liber II appeared in the spring of 2012, as did 777: Cosmosophy, the final chapter of that album series, in October of 2012. The next entry in the EP series, What Once Was... Liber III, was issued in November of 2013, as were the reissues of its first two volumes. As a next step, the group issued Triunity in June of 2014, a split with French industrial doom metallers P.H.O.B.O.S. In October, Vetusta III: Saturnian Poetry arrived on Debemur Morti. The following year saw two separate retrospective volumes called The Candlelight Years. Codex Obscura Nomina, a split album with American blackened death metal band Ævangelist, appeared in the early summer of 2016. BAN\\'s half featured a four-track suite entitled \"Sonic Waves (The Sound Is an Organic Matter).\" In early 2018, the band released the doomy full-length Deus Salutis Meæ (God of My Salvation). In the fall of 2019, Blut aus Nord issued the post-psychedelic Hallucinogen, their most melodic, progressively realized record to date. Despite its wildly experimental nature, fans and critics embraced it uniformly. In May 2022, just after the band\\'s 28th anniversary, Debemur Morti released the full-length Disharmonium: Undreamable Abysses. The seven-track set re-engaged with vanguard industrialized black metal, shot through with bleak, maximalist harmonic dis-ease. In 2020, Debemur Morti and Blut Aus Nord began a collaboration. Called \"The Order of Outer Sounds,\" it was a subscriber-based forum that ran for over two years -- between 2020 and 2022. The Order provided an inventive new playground for experimentation. Lovecraftian Echoes, recorded/mixed by Vindsval at Earthsound studio, was completed in installments for subscribers, and issued between April 2021 and February 2022 before being released digitally to the general public later that year. The band went to great pains to explain that Lovecraftian Echoes was not a Blut aus Nord album per se, but a compilation of custom-made pieces continuing the musical exploration started with 2003\\'s The Work Which Transforms God. Blut aus Nord issued Disharmonium: Nahab, a \"new\" album that continued the musical and production ideas first asserted on Disharmonium: Undreamable Abysses. ~ Alex Henderson, Rovi'\n",

      "'Emerging like ghoulish demons out of the depths of Norway\\'s darkest woods (at least, that\\'s how they would have dreamed it), Carpathian Forest centers around the fearsome duo of Nattefrost (vocals/guitar/bass) and Nordavind (guitar/bass), who first teamed up to compose their dark musical sorcery in the early \\'90s. A textbook example of so-called \"true\" black metal in the old-school Scandinavian definition (serious devil worship, pagan rituals, corpse face paint, criminal record recommended), Carpathian Forest recorded a set of fittingly appalling early demos, beginning with 1992\\'s notorious Bloodlust &amp; Perversion tape (reissued on CD in 1997). Quickly becoming a hot item on the underground tape-trading network thanks to its incredibly primitive, lo-fi contents, the demo garnered the new group almost instant cult status, starting them on their path to black metal infamy. After showing a vast technical improvement with the next year\\'s Journey Through the Cold Moors of Svarttjern, the duo scored a deal with the Avant Garde label, for whom they recorded 1995\\'s Through Chasm, Caves and Titan Woods with the help of some local scene friends. The release couldn\\'t have arrived at a more propitious time, as the recent imprisonment of Burzum\\'s Varg Vikernes for the murder of the legendary Mayhem and \"Inner Circle\" leader Euronymous had left thousands of black metal fans searching for new heroes to worship. Carpathian Forest was as poised to capitalize on the situation as anyone, but the band vanished from sight instead, not be heard from again for nearly three years. The reasons behind this disappearance remain as mysterious as the band itself, but 1998\\'s Black Shining Leather proved to be a surprisingly powerful comeback, making it seem like the band had never been gone at all and featuring a stunning cover of the Cure\\'s \"A Forest.\" Nordavind left the band under reportedly amicable circumstances shortly after the recording of 2000\\'s Strange Old Brew, but Carpathian Forest still plans to forge ahead with its career. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

Black Metal has been the keyword since inception.The first demo \"Reality Is In Evil...\" briefly saw the moonlight in \\'95; the second demo \"Eternal Realm\" surfaced in \\'97; and the third demo \"Blessed Be The Darkness\" followed in ‘98. At this point, Reaper left the band and BEHEXEN recruited Gargantum on guitar and Lunatic on bass in order to perform live rituals. \"Blessed Be The Darkness\" brought forth an ill-fated deal from Sinister Figure and the debut album \"Rituale Satanum\" was recorded in the summer of 1999. Due to countless problems, the band drifted away from this rip-off label and waited three years for that deal to expire. During this period, Veilroth joined as second guitarist.In May 2003, BEHEXEN signed with Finnish label Woodcut Records and recorded their second full-length album \"By The Blessing Of Satan\" which was unleashed the following year.In 2008, fresh from the Tour Of The Blackmoon with ARCHGOAT and HELL MILITIA, the band unleashed its third album, “My Soul For His Glory” on Hammer Of Hate.BEHEXEN has now inked a deal in blood with Debemur Morti Productions to deliver the fourth full-length, the two parties having conspired previously on a reissue of the BEHEXEN / HORNA split.BEHEXEN, with original members Torog and Horns, is and always will be Black Metal in its blackest and rawest form.'\n",

      "\"Taking their name from an ancient Norse battle cry, Norway's Kampfar employ a punishing -- and at time victorious -- blend of icy black metal, neoclassical, and rousing Viking folk-metal. Initially begun as a solo project for ex-Mock frontman Dolk (Per Joar Spydevold), it eventually developed into a group effort, with Dolk serving as the sole constant member. Beginning with 1997's Mellom Skogkledde Aaser, the band unleashed a string of acclaimed albums, including 2006's Kvass and 2015's Profan, the latter of which brought home a Spellemann award (the Norwegian version of a Grammy).Dolk founded Kampfar alongside guitarist Thomas Andreassen in 1994 after leaving fellow Norwegian black mettallers Mock. The duo's demo was issued later that same year via Season of Mist. They inked a deal with German label Malicious for their 1997 debut album Mellom Skogkledde Aaser. Friction between Dolk and the label resulted in a move to Hammerheart, for whom Kampfar recorded the EP Norse in 1998. That same year the band issued the full-length Fra Underverdenen, which saw them moving in a more neoclassical black metal direction. Kampfar went on hiatus shortly thereafter, but reconvened in 2003 as a quartet with the additions of bassist Jon Bakker and vocalist/drummer Ask Ty Arctander. Up until then, Kampfar had enjoyed underground success, but had never played live. They made their concert debut the following year at the Moshfest festival in Halden, and began developing material for a new album. The resulting Kvass arrived in 2006, and marked the group's debut outing for Napalm Records. It also signaled a shift in timbre that looked to classic Norwegian black metal for inspiration, evoking names like Enslaved, Behemoth, and Emperor. 2008's Heimgang adopted a similar tone, as did 2010's Mare, though the latter LP was recorded without longtime guitarist Andreassen, who left the fold shortly before its creation. Guitarist Ole Hartvigsen joined in 2011, and made his studio debut on 2014's Djevelmakt, which saw the band move from Napalm to Indie Recordings. Just a little over a year , Kampfar issued their seventh full-length effort, Profan, which earned a Spellemann award for best achievement in the metal genre. A period of personal struggles within the group preceded the release of 2019's epic Ofidians Manifest, which featured guest vocal spots from Agnete Kjølsrud (Djerv, Animal Alpha) and Ask Ty's sister Marianne Maria Moen. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi\"\n",

      "\"According to some gospels, when Jesus Christ referred to Hell, he often used the word Gehenna, which was actually the name of Jerusalem's garbage dump -- where fires were constantly kept burning to cope with the city's refuse. Fast forward roughly 2,000 years and the name was adopted by one of Norway's most influential black metal bands, which formed in the town of Stavanger, in January 1993, in the wake of local forefathers Mayhem's ascendance, and integrated a now heralded generation also including such contemporaries as Emperor, Enslaved, Darkthrone, and Ulver. Initially comprising vocalist/guitarist Sanrabb, guitarist/bassist Dolgar (real name Steffen Simenstad), and drummer Sir Vereda, the initially nameless project that would become Gehenna recorded a pair of demos, Black Seared Heart and Ancestors of the Darkly Sky, in their first year, before earning their Scandinavian black metal stripes in dubious fashion when the drummer joined several other more prominent scene members behind bars. Even so, by the following year, Sanrabb and Dolgar had drafted bassist Svartalv, keyboardist Sarcana, and drummer Dirge Rep (aka Per Husebø), played their first local shows, and recorded a debut mini-album entitled First Spell for Head Not Found Records. Still widely regarded to be their definitive work, First Spell showcased a unique style of black metal, both somber and melodic in nature, and earned the group a new recording contract with Cacophonous Records, which also released subsequent efforts Seen Through the Veils of Darkness (1995) and Malice (1996) to serious acclaim in the underground metal world. But Gehenna almost came to a grinding halt in 1997, when internal tensions led to Svartalv's departure to found thrash band Nocturnal Breed, Dirge Rep's defection to Enslaved, and Sarcana's retirement from the scene. Sanrabb and Dolgar would re-emerge the following year with a new album entitled Adimiron Black for Moonfog Productions, and new members E.N. Death (bass), Blod (drums), and Damien (keyboards), but the latter would soon be dismissed due to Gehenna's distinctly more aggressive sound. In fact, by the release of 2000's Murder, Gehenna had reinvented themselves as a death metal band, leaving many observers puzzled. Come 2005's WW, they'd once again returned to their haunting black metal roots, but time has yet to tell whether their fans returned to it with them. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Following in the footsteps of Sweden\\'s Bathory, who were among the first European groups to utilize their own national legends as inspiration for their songwriting themes (Norse and Viking tradition, in their case), Negura Bunget combine Romanian history and folklore into a mystical sonic adventure, quite literally inspired by their homeland of Transylvania. Emerging in the mid-\\'90s with the regionally successful Zîrnindu-Să, the group caught fire in 2006 with the release of their double concept LP OM, which crystallized their unique blend of folk and black metal. Despite enduring numerous lineup changes over the years, the band managed to release a string of well-regarded albums like Vîrstele Pămîntului (2010) and Zi (2016), the latter of which proved to be their final outing in the wake of the 2017 death of co-founder and drummer Negru (Gabriel Mafa). Formed in 1995 by Hupogrammos Disciple (vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Negru (drums, xylophone) under the name Wiccan Rede, the group recorded their first demo, appropriately entitled \"From Transylvania Forest\" at Bucharest\\'s Magic Sound Studios, with the help of keyboard player Aiwazz Valah Disciple. After adopting the Negura Bunget name the following year, the group began performing regularly and recorded their full-length debut, Zîrnindu-Să in October 1996 -- all the while delving ever deeper into elements of their ancestral ideology in order to concoct a unique black metal perspective. The Sala Molksa EP followed two years later, after which bassist Vampir and keyboard player Daniel (replacing Aiwazz) joined the band\\'s live performance lineup. Third album Maiastru Sfelnic emerged in the year 2000, and led to extended touring engagements and a new deal with Italy\\'s Code 666 label. The \\'N Crugu Bradului LP arrived in 2002 and counted new guitarist Sol Faur Spurcatu and bassist Ursu among its fold. The album, nearly an hour in length, contained only four tracks (all conceptually oriented around the number four and its place in the order of nature, the universe, and even the expansion of consciousness. It built on the band\\'s critical reputation and attracted the more progressively oriented metal and post-rock fans. Negura Bunget followed it with the Inarborat Kosmos EP and undertook extensive touring, previewing material for what would become its magnum opus during the first decade of the new century. OM, issued in 2006 on Code 666, confounded and excited fans with its construction and ambition. Weaving noise, raw and atmospheric black metal, folk metal, and progressive sounds both industrial and ambient in an hour-long suite -- artificially divided into tracks -- it was regarded by metal critics as one of the year\\'s best albums. They undertook a European tour in the spring of 2007, played more y40 concerts throughout Europe, and played another one in the late fall. After a short break, they toured the European festival circuit again during the latter half of 2008, performing at Wacken OpenAir, Summerbreeze, Artmania Festival, Kaltenbach Open Air, Rockmania Festival, and Paalisare Rock Fest. It was during this period that drummer Negru began a side project called Din Brad. The band splintered into two factions in 2009. Negru kept the band\\'s name and began recording with the first of several lineups, while Hupogrammos and Sol Faur formed Dordeduh. Before that break, however, they finished Măiestrit, a re-interpretation of their original album Măiastru Sfetnic. It was released by Prophecy Productions in January 2010, followed by Vîrstele Pămîntului, released by Code666 in March. The newer lineup under Negru undertook extensive touring throughout the spring and summer, and after a brief break, went out again in the fall. They played 72 shows that year in addition to releasing two albums.In 2011, Negura Bunget\\'s 15th anniversary was marked by a flurry of intense release and concert activity: The concert film/album, Focul Viu, was released. It was recorded and documented in Bucharest in January 2008 and featured the classic trio lineup with backing musicians. It was followed by the Poarta de Dincolo EP (their final work for Code 666). They toured Romania and Europe throughout the rest of the year. The band played their first Canadian and American tours in the spring of 2012 and toured Europe again in the summer. That same year, Negru\\'s Din Brad issued its debut album, Dor.After more extensive road work and a short break, the EP Gînd A-Prins appeared in the fall of 2013 and was followed over the next year with even more pervasive touring. The band issued TĂU, the first part in their \"Transilvanian Trilogy\" in 2015. An elaborate production, it included a 72-page booklet, and some pressings contained a bonus disc. It set them up for a second North American tour as well as festival headline performances in Europe over the summer. They re-entered the studio in early 2016, and emerged with ZI, the second volume in the Transylvanian Trilogy. It was released in September of 2016. On March 21, 2017 Negru suffered a heart attack at the age of 42 and passed away, leaving the group without any original members. While Negura Bunget was effectively no more, they planned on releasing the third installment of the trilogy, which was left largely unfinished, in 2019. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "'A punishing German depressive black metal group united by a morbid, almost pathological fascination with suicide, madness, sickness, and death, Bethlehem emerged in the early 1990s with a style that hewed closely to the frosty tenets of doomy European black metal. Debuting in 1994 with the uncompromising and aptly named Dark Metal, the band would add elements of industrial and post-metal to their sonic arsenal on later offerings like A Sacrificial Offering to the Kingdom of Heaven in a Cracked Dog\\'s Ear (2010), before returning to the icy miasma of earlier offerings with Bethlehem (2014) and Lebe Dich Leer (2019). Having grown tired of the thrash-based aggressions of their earlier joint project, Dark Tempest, bassist Jürgen Bartsch and guitarist Klaus Matton (who as a boy lost his father to suicide and mother to cancer) founded Bethlehem in 1991. Along with vocalist Andreas Classen and drummer Chris Steinhoff, they proceeded to channel their rampant negativity into the moody, atmospheric brand of dark/black metal (punctuated by tortured shrieking) presented on 1994\\'s Thy Pale Dominion 7\" EP and 1995\\'s seminal full-length debut Dark Metal. Their spirits did not improve on subsequent, despair-drenched outings like 1996\\'s Dictus Te Necare (translation: \"Kill Yourself\"), 1997\\'s S.U.I.Z.I.D. (full title: Sardonischer Untergang Im Zeichen Irreliogiosen Darbietung), and 1998\\'s Reflektionen Auf\\'s Sterben EP, and various vocalists, drummers, and keyboard players sifted through their ranks as well. Bethlehem also ran into quite a bit of trouble with German authorities over their perceived glorification of death and, among many tasteless self-promotion stunts, claiming that former singer Classen had \"offed\" himself. The band managed to stay a few steps ahead of the law, however, and even endured the departure of leader-in-misery Matton to complete 2001\\'s ambitiously avant-garde industrial-tinged double-disc set Schatten Aus der Alexander Welt. Heading into 2002, the Bethlehem lineup consisted of founder Bartsch, Guido Meyer de Voltaire (vocals), Olaf Eckhardt (guitar), Reiner Tiedemann (keyboards), and Steve Wolz (drums), and was hard at work on an interactive release under the disturbing title Suicide Radio. The following year saw the release of the group\\'s fifth full-length studio effort, Mein Weg, with the punitive A Sacrificial Offering to the Kingdom of Heaven in a Cracked Dog\\'s Ear arriving in 2009. Bethlehem continued to explore new sonic territories on 2014\\'s industrial-tinged Hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia, which means fear of the number 666, but reverted back to their bleak, doom-laden black metal past on 2016\\'s eponymous Bethlehem. They continued in that suicidal black metal vein on 2019\\'s Lebe Dich Leer, which marked the debut of frontwoman Onielar, formerly of Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

Bassist Kai Lie replaced Infernus for their second album, The Olden Domain, in 1997; the album featured English lyrics and shifted to a more pagan/folk metal sound. The following year, Borknagar undertook a full-scale European tour in support of In Flames. With new vocalist I.C.S. Vortex (aka Simen Hestnaes) and guitarist Jens F. Ryland, Borknagar immediately jumped back into the studio to record and release 1998\\'s progressive The Archaic Course without any breaks in between. Unfortunately, Grim died of a sleeping-pill overdose in October 1999; he was briefly replaced by Justin Greaves, followed by Asgeir Mickelson. For 2000\\'s even more progressive Quintessence album, Vortex took over bass duties, and new keyboardist Lasare signed on. After the album\\'s release, Vortex left the band to join Dimmu Borgir. Vintersorg (Andreas Hedlund) became the group\\'s new vocalist, and Tyr (Jan Erik Tiwaz) joined on bass. This lineup recorded Empiricism, which was released in October 2001. The album became one of the group\\'s most popular releases and was nominated for major music awards in Norway. Halfway through the recording of the band\\'s next album, Tyr left the group, and Mickelson assumed bass duties. Ryland also left the group. Despite the stripped-down lineup, the aptly titled Epic was the group\\'s most ambitious work to date, and the 2004 album was another success. Tyr rejoined Borknagar for 2007\\'s Origin, which was a primarily acoustic effort. The group signed to Indie Recordings at the end of the year, and Century Media released the compilation For the Elements (1996–2006) in 2008. At this point, Ryland had rejoined Borknagar, and the group was hoping for an early 2009 release for its next album. However, Asgeir left the band (on good terms) in May 2008, and American drummer David Kinkade joined the group; they announced their eighth full-length, Universal, in April 2009, with a projected September release date, but the album was delayed until February 2010. Vortex provided guest vocals on the song \"My Domain,\" and soon after replaced Tyr (who left again) on Borknagar\\'s live dates before rejoining them full-time. Their deal with Indie Recordings fell through in early 2011, and they re-signed with Century Media. Their Norse mythology-themed ninth album, Urd, appeared on the label in March 2012. The full-length was the last Borknagar album to include Kinkade, who left to concentrate on his role as drummer for the band Soulfly; he subsequently retired from music to devote more time to his family. Baard Kolstad became Borknagar\\'s new drummer in February 2012. The group spent much of 2014 and 2015 recording its next album, which was set back due to injuries suffered by Vintersorg. Winter Thrice finally appeared in early 2016, and the album included a guest appearance by the group\\'s original vocalist, Garm. Vintersorg left the group amicably in early 2019, as did drummer Baard Kolstad, the latter of whom was replaced by Bjørn Dugstad Rønnow. Vortex rejoined the group on vocals for their 11th studio long-player, True North, which was released later that fall. ~ Mike DaRonco &amp; Paul Simpson, Rovi'\n",

Enthralled with all things satanic and evil, Ragnarok debuted with 1995\\'s Nattferd (meaning \"A Journey Through the Night\") and later brought in Dimmu Borgir\\'s Shagrath as a guest keyboardist on 1997\\'s Arising Realm.

      "'Founded by Chicago musician Blake Judd and aided by a rotating cast of backing players, Nachtmystium took black metal\\'s extremity to more psychedelic places, often experimenting with structure, production and stylistic approach. From the beginning of 2000 until their 2014 dissolution, the project evolved from traditional raw black metal into more progressive and boundary pushing territory, changing incrementally over the course of prolifically released albums and building their fan base with standout releases like 2006\\'s Instinct: Decay and 2010\\'s Addicts: Black Meddle, Pt. II. Judd struggled with heroin addiction during the band\\'s initial run, and developed a bad reputation for ripping off fans by taking money for Nachtmystium albums with no intention of ever delivering or refunding the unfulfilled orders. These troubles reached their apex in 2013 when he was arrested for theft amid being called out en mass by the metal community for his scams. Judd announced the band would be breaking up before the release of 2014\\'s The World We Left Behind, but he reactivated the project in 2017.Nachtmystium first took shape in the late \\'90s when Judd and drummer Pat McCormick began recording demos in the basement of Judd\\'s parent\\'s house. Still in their teens, the two had played together in other bands but took inspiration from black metal acts like Darkthrone when they began work on the raw, lo-fi recordings that eventually led them into forming a full-time band. Judd made up the word \"Nachtmystium\" by joining the German word for \"night\" with the made-up word \"mystium.\" Throughout the band\\'s lifespan, Judd would be the only consistent member, joined in the studio and on-stage by an ever-changing cast of supporting players. The band began playing live around 2000 and the first widely distributed recordings came with 2002\\'s Reign of the Malicious. At this time the band was fashioned closely after traditional black metal, with intentionally crude recordings, an illegible logo, and a corpse paint-adorned Judd going by stage name Azentrius. 2004\\'s Demise followed a similar stylistic path, but with 2006\\'s Instinct: Decay, Nachtmystium began to incorporate more psychedelic influences and experimental production into their sound. Judd had been a longtime fan of both studio boundary-pushers Pink Floyd and live explorers the Allman Brothers, and with this album he began expanding Nachtmystium\\'s sound with those reference points in mind. 2008\\'s Assassins: Black Meddle, Pt. I took this departure from black metal even further. This would be the first album where Judd was credited with his real name and apart from stylistic turns towards stoner metal as well expanded instrumentation with saxophone and electronic elements, Judd nodded to the influence of Pink Floyd both in the album\\'s title (citing their 1971 album Meddle as the inspiration for Black Meddle) as well as with album-opener \"One of These Nights...,\" a reply to Pink Floyd\\'s \"One of These Days.\" At this point, Nachtmystium was extremely popular, touring internationally and considered by many to be one of the more important black metal-related bands to come out of the United States. 2010\\'s Addicts: Black Meddle, Pt. II continued the band\\'s stylistic experimentation, leaning more toward industrial influences and the use of programmed drums and electronics within an extreme music framework. A return to black metal roots defined 2012\\'s Silencing Machine. Judd began struggling with a heroin addiction sometime after getting hooked on opioids he was prescribed for a leg injury in 2009. Troubles with addiction and Judd\\'s increasingly sketchy reputation began to plague the Nachtmystium name, with many fans paying Judd for records that he never delivered or issued refunds for. Controversy grew and things reached a boiling point in 2013 when Judd was arrested for stealing his roommate\\'s guitar and selling it so he could buy heroin. This came in conjunction with a barrage of public complaints for his scamming fans and in late 2013, Judd announced he would be disbanding Nachtmystium after completing work on their next album. That album, The World We Left Behind, was released to mixed reviews in 2014 and Judd focused on other projects as well as trying to clean up his life and seek help for his addiction. In 2016, Earache Records acquired the rights to the band\\'s catalog of studio albums and also released a collection of rarities, demos, and remixes entitled Retox in 2017. Also in 2017, a now sober Judd re-formed Nachtmystium to play two exclusive gigs and began work on an EP of new material called Resilient, slated for release at the end of 2018. ~ Fred Thomas, Rovi'\n",

      "'One of the Czech Republic\\'s first black metal bands, Master\\'s Hammer was formed in Prague in 1983, and spent the first half of their career operating in obscurity behind the Iron Curtain, but working on demos that slowly spread their cult into the West, as they were circulated by resourceful heavy metal fans trading tapes across the globe. In fact, tape-trading and illegal imports were just as instrumental in providing the members of Master\\'s Hammer with their mostly contrabanded source of inspiration, which evidently included the works of primal English BM godfathers Venom, theatrical Danes Mercyful Fate, and Swiss mavericks Hellhammer, among others. By the time what was then still Czechoslovakia broke free of Communism and the Soviet Union\\'s control, in 1989, Master\\'s Hammer had come into their own as a band, and, just two years later, their stunning debut album, Ritual, revealed a surprisingly contemporary and intense brand of black metal, featuring rampant savagery wed to well-crafted arrangements and keyboards, akin to rising Norwegian powers like Mayhem, Emperor, and Darkthrone. The group -- which at this time was comprised of vocalist/guitarist Franta Storm, keyboardist Vlasta Voral, guitarist Tomás \"Necrocock\" Kohout, bassist Tomás \"Monster\" Vendl, drummer Mirek Valenta, and percussionist Honza \"Silenthell\" Pøibyl -- also had a backlog of material, apparently, because they wasted little time before recording their sophomore full-length, The Jilemnice Occultist, which emerged through France\\'s Osmose Productions, in 1992 (it is also rumored that said album was recorded prior to their debut). Unfortunately, Master\\'s Hammer lost most of their membership a short time later, and after a few years of inactivity, Storm and Voral decided to record a farewell album entitled Slagry (1995), whose progressive experiments and numerous obscure cover songs had very little to do with metal, or the band\\'s previous output, thereby signaling the end of Master\\'s Hammer. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

The Swedes have long enjoyed a massive cult status within underground circles, yet also gained strong acclaim and recognition by mainstream metal media and critics.CRAFT were spawned by guitarist Joakim, who was joined by a friend on drums late 1994. Lead guitarist John was added to the roster in 1996, but left in 1998 only to return about a year later. A demo entitled 'Total Eclipse' hit the world in 1999 and quickly led to a first record deal. During the recording of their crushing debut ‘Total Soul Rape' (2000), the Swedes were reinforced by vocalist Nox. This misanthropy dripping album captured the ear of SHINING's Niklas Kvarforth, who released the sophomore 'Terror Propaganda' in 2002 on his label Selbstmord Services. With this extremely dark piece of music the group gained much acclaim by critics and fans alike. CRAFT followed up in their typical hateful and destructive style by adding 'Fuck the Universe' (2005) and 'Void' (2011) to the list of their albums.

Richly layered, it is also their most textured release, and they dive ever deeper into the themes they have been exploring since dropping their debut full-length in 2010, Towards The Blaze Of Perdition. “I would say the new record is to 2017′s ‘Conscious Darkness‘ what [2011's] ‘The Hierophant‘ was for ‘Towards The Blaze Of Perdition‘ – a continuation of the initial idea, but in more energetic and catchy form. Perhaps more approachable and listener-friendly, but it's not up to me to decide,” states vocalist Sonneillon. “Although some gothic rock influences could be heard on ‘Conscious Darkness‘, here we took them out of the shadows and let them shine in the spotlight. It's also our most collectively written effort so far, with every band member throwing something meaningful to the whole.”Working with the same producer they've been teaming with since 2013 and with artwork designed by Izabela Grabda, every aspect of The Harrowing Of Heartshas come together as intended, and with Metal Blade now behind them, the band are now ready to work their asses off to spread their name ever further.

Their debut album Potestas Magicum Diaboli, released by KVLT Records in 2017, reaped widespread acclaim across the world, garnering attention, largely because it was the work of two women – a rarity in black metal – who quickly rendered gender an irrelevant argument. Dawn of Infinite Fire sees ASAGRAUM burning with equally intensity in songwriting, execution, and atmosphere, staying true to their original aims whilst pushing their classicist sound further into the present. Granted, that blast-from-the-past classicism is inescapable – this is pure, traditional BLACK METAL above all – but not once across\\xa0Dawn\\xa0of\\xa0Infinite\\xa0Fire\\xa0does that hinder their timeless expression. If anything, this is the sound of ASAGRAUM at their most anthemic and triumphant, marching forward with obsidian austerity, reflecting their prolific presence on the live front: tangibly physical black metal, played with passion and authenticity and not augmented by cheap studio trickery.

As a result, PUSH PULL nails the group's underappreciated sweet spot - large-scale, muscular ‘80s-‘90s alternative rock of U2, Duran Duran and even Tears for Fears, whose “Heads Over Heels” gets a brawny, Bowiesque take on the album. Hoobastank approached PUSH PULL with the swagger and confidence of a band whose first three albums all went either gold, platinum or multi-platinum. “The Reason” garnered GRAMMY nominations for “Song of the Year,” “Best Rock Album” and “Best Pop Performance” for a Duo or Group. Album highlights include the title track “Push Pull,” and focus track “More Beautiful,” while the funky R&amp;B feel is a tribute to DAN's early, late--‘90s penchant for Chic and “groove-based” dance music. Songs like “True Believer” and “Buzzkill (Before You Say Goodbye)” show Hoobastank maturing from adolescent to adult relationships. “We stopped attempting to recreate any formula,” DOUG says. “We did what made us happy and played to our strengths.

      "'It has been said that first impressions last a lifetime. Luckily for Staind, some only last for about 45 minutes. After a volatile disagreement with Limp Bizkit\\'s Fred Durst over some of Staind\\'s early cover art, it seemed their big break had walked out the door. Fortunately, by the time Durst had witnessed Staind\\'s intense live show, he was ready to exchange phone numbers. Staind\\'s story began in the New England area when vocalist Aaron Lewis and guitarist Mike Mushok met at a Christmas party in 1993. Mushok was able to bring drummer Jon Wysocki into the fold, and Lewis\\' connection with a bass player (who later left) completed the early lineup. Establishing themselves took time, and extensive touring of the Northeast with other established metal acts helped them sell over 2,000 copies of their self-released debut in just over a year. They were primed for their big break, and on October 23, 1997, the hard work paid off.At a show in Hartford, Connecticut, Staind were all set to open for Limp Bizkit when Bizkit singer Durst raised a stink over cover art on Staind\\'s self-released CD. After a heated conversation over whether or not Staind were Satan worshipers, Durst forcefully returned the disc to the band, and walked away. But 45 minutes later Durst was back, not to further the argument, but to make sure he kept in contact with Staind. Blown away by their live show, Durst exchanged phone numbers, and loved their demo tape when they gave it to him. He convinced them to travel to Jacksonville, Florida, to work on the new songs.After reworking the new material and a successful live show, Durst contacted the head of Flip Records and arranged a meeting for Staind with the label. While in Los Angeles, a three-song sampler was recorded, and by the time February rolled around in 1998, the band had a record deal. After playing the Vans Warped Tour, they began work on their first album, Dysfunction. The album was produced by Terry Date (Deftones, Pantera, Soundgarden) and was released April 13, 1999. A tour with Kid Rock followed that spring and later the band reunited with good friends Limp Bizkit for a summer tour. Their follow-up, Break the Cycle, enjoyed a prolonged visit at the number one spot on U.S. charts in 2001. Smash hits like \"It\\'s Been a While,\" \"Fade,\" \"For You,\" and \"Epiphany\" catapulted Staind into the mainstream, leaving their 2002 DVD MTV Unplugged to go gold. Staind released 14 Shades of Grey in spring 2003, and after a two-year break returned with the chart-topping Chapter V, named to include their self-released debut in the Staind canon. A Singles and Videos compilation arrived in 2006, followed by the all-new studio album Illusion of Progress in 2008, the latter of which debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The band\\'s eponymous seventh studio album, which saw the departure of longtime drummer Jon Wysocki, arrived on September 13, 2011. Later that year, the band recruited drummer Sal Giancarelli and hit the road, documenting the tour with 2012\\'s Live from Mohegan Sun, which captured the tour\\'s first show. ~ Chris True, Rovi'\n",

      "'Max Cavalera has been delivering punishing, neck-snapping riffs since the 1980s, first as a founding member of influential Brazilian thrash legends Sepultura, and later as the ringleader for the more cerebral, yet similarly punitive Soulfly. Emerging in the late \\'90s, Soulfly\\'s sonic attack is built on a foundation of multiple subgenres of metal and worldbeat, drawing heavily from groove, thrash, nu-metal, and Brazilian tribal music. The band\\'s eponymous 1998 debut was certified gold, and paved the way for efforts like Conquer (2008), Archangel (2015), Ritual (2018), and Totem (2022), all of which garnered both critical and commercial acclaim. Throughout the group\\'s two-decade run, there have been multiple personnel shifts, with Cavalera being the only constant member. Upon his exit from Sepultura in late 1996, Cavalera almost automatically set out to form his next musical endeavor. Besides leaving one of the most popular heavy metal bands in the world, which he\\'d co-founded in the early \\'80s, he also had to deal with the death of his best friend and stepson Dana Wells. Using music as therapy to overcome his depression, Cavalera put together a band that included Roy \"Rata\" Mayorga on drums (ex-Thorn) and Jackson Bandeira on second guitar (ex-Chico Science), while former Sepultura roadie Marcello D. Rapp rounded out the quartet on bass. Their Roadrunner-issued self-titled debut album was released in the spring of 1998, and eventually went gold. Soulfly\\'s second album, 2000\\'s Primitive, was their highest-charting LP to date, and featured guest spots from Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, Sean Lennon, Chino Moreno of Deftones, and Tom Araya of Slayer, among others. Cavalera handled the production for 2002\\'s III, which marked the studio debut of guitarist Marc Rizzo and featured the ballad \"Tree of Pain,\" a heartfelt tribute to Dana Wells. 2004\\'s Prophecy featured a completely re-tooled lineup and adopted a more spiritual tone. 2005\\'s Dark Ages took a more brooding and savage approach, fueled in large part by the deaths of Cavalera\\'s eight-year-old grandson and close friend Dimebag Darrell. In 2007 Cavalera began collaborating with brother and former Sepultura drummer Igor on a project called Cavalera Conspiracy. The duo made its live debut that August as the opening act for Soulfly, and went on to release an album, Inflikted, for Roadrunner in 2008. Soulfly\\'s sixth full-length offering, the punitive Conquer, arrived in July 2008, and included guest appearances by Morbid Angel\\'s David Vincent and Throwdown\\'s Dave Peters. Omen, the band\\'s seventh studio long-player, arrived in 2010, followed by Enslaved in 2012, the latter of which saw the group leaning into their death metal influences with the help of special guests Dez Fafara of Coal Chamber and Travis Ryan of Cattle Decapitation. Throughout that year, the band toured their own \"Maximum Cavalera\" package, featuring three bands all fronted by members of the Cavalera family: Soulfly, Incite, and Lody Kong. For the next album, the band moved from their longtime home of Roadrunner Records to Nuclear Blast, and Cavalera\\'s youngest son Zyon took over on drums. The effort, entitled Savages, was produced by Terry Date and released in October 2013. The band began recording a follow-up almost immediately with producer Matt Hyde. The finished product, Archangel, was issued in 2015. Their shortest record at just over 36 minutes, it was also their last with longtime bassist Tony Campos, who left to join Fear Factory shortly after the album\\'s completion. The band returned to the heavy, groove-laden sonic punch of past efforts like Primitive and III on their 11th full-length effort, 2018\\'s hard-hitting Ritual. Max and Zyon spent two years writing the band\\'s 12fth groove-metal opus, the sonically brutal yet vibrant and life-affirming Totem. The first Soulfly effort since 2002 to not feature longtime guitarist Marc Rizzo, who left the fold in 2021, Totem appeared in 2022. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'Evanescence will release their first album of new original music in nine years, The Bitter Truth (BMG) over the course of this year, beginning with the first song and video, \"Wasted on You,\" out now. The video for “Wasted on You” was shot by each band member on their iPhones while currently in isolation. As Amy explains, “We were recording this music right up until we couldn\\'t go into the studio anymore, and finished it remotely through file sharing and phone calls. Tweaking mixes, adding background vocals, creating the video and album art all from home has been like water in the dessert for me, my light in a dark time. We are still writing and have a lot more work to do on this album, but this time we wanted to release the songs individually, as we create, to live more in the moment with our fans and our music.  Wasted On You wasn\\'t the song we were planning to release first, but when the whole world went into indefinite lockdown and everything changed, so did the feeling and meaning of what we wanted to say right now. I didn\\'t write these lyrics about what we\\'re all now going through, but somehow that\\'s exactly what they are.'\n",

Welcome, the band's first with producer Toby Wright (Alice in Chains, Korn) which Rolling Stone called, “a self-preserving transition from new metal to art metal”, went on to sell over 500,000 copies, spawning the hit Rock singles “Poem”, and “Mine”, and propelling Welcome to over 50 million digital streams. The band continued heavy touring with Alien Ant Farm, Disturbed, on the 2004 Music As A Weapon Tour, and Linkin Park. Vocalist Stephen Richards would also appear on the track “P5hng Me A*wy” on Linkin Park's 2002 remix album REANIMATION.2005's Blue-Sky Research, also helmed by Wright, was the band's final Atlantic release, ft. the hit single “Calling”, co-written with FAR vocalist Jonah Matranga, and saw the band collaborate with Billy Corgan, Nick Hexum (311), and Stephen Carpenter (Deftones), with heavy touring again, with the likes of Chevelle, Staind, POD, &amp; Flyleaf.

      "'Crazy Town\\'s music and image reflected one of the most dynamic and volatile sociocultural environments on the planet -- Los Angeles -- where the urban squalor of the South Central district exists just minutes away from the glitz of Beverly Hills. Spearheaded by a team of producers/vocalists, Seth \"Shifty Shellshock\" Binzer and Bret \"Epic\" Mazur, Crazy Town combined hip-hop\\'s lyrical attitude and rhythmic sass with the muscle of live rock instrumentation. The combination yielded the group a number one hit in 2001, when \"Butterfly\" topped the Billboard 100 and helped push the band\\'s debut effort, The Gift of Game, to platinum status.Bret Mazur and Seth Binzer were both surrounded by music while growing up in Southern California. Mazur\\'s father was Billy Joel\\'s manager, while Binzer\\'s father was an artist and filmmaker who directed the Rolling Stones\\' live movie Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones. The two boys preferred a different style of music, however, listening instead to rap acts like N.W.A., Cypress Hill, and Ice-T, as well as alternative rock bands like the Cure. Originally from New York, Mazur started crafting beats and cutting tracks at an early age and found himself working on records by MC Serch (of 3rd Bass), Eazy-E, and MC Lyte; he was also House of Pain\\'s DJ for a short period. Meanwhile, Binzer had come across a copy of the Beastie Boys\\' Licensed to Ill while in Mexico, and discovered a side of hip-hop that inspired him to start making demo recordings on his own. Binzer and Mazur initially came together as the Brimstone Sluggers, and while the pair recorded plenty of music, their contributions to other hip-hoppers\\' projects prevented them from completing a full album of their own. They also each ended up in rehabilitation clinics, where the two began writing letters that helped hatch the plan to form Crazy Town: a hip-hop band featuring a full instrumental lineup to complement the rapping vocalists. The group was to be rooted in classic rap-rock miscegenation like Run-D.M.C.\\'s \"Rock Box,\" or Public Enemy and Anthrax\\'s collaborative effort \"Bring Tha Noize.\" Doug \"Faydoedeelay\" Miller (bass), Rust Epique (guitar), Anthony \"Trouble\" Valli (guitar), DJ AM (turntables), and drummer James \"JBJ\" Bradley -- a former session player who played on the Beastie Boys\\' Check Your Head album -- were recruited to join the group, and Crazy Town was officially born. The band\\'s debut album, The Gift of Game, was produced by close friend Josh Abraham and featured appearances by KRS-One, dancehall toastmaster Mad Lion, and Dirty Unit. The album spawned a world-wide hit with \"Butterfly,\" an ode to attractive women, and put the band on the road to success. After 2002\\'s Howard Benson-produced Darkhorse failed to receive similar accolades, the band broke up in 2003. Crazy Town\\'s members pursued production projects and solo careers as the decade progressed, but between Binzer\\'s myriad bouts with drug addiction and the death of DJ AM (2009), attempts to reunite the band never truly took hold. That all changed in 2013 when the Mazur and Binzer let fly in an interview that they were currently in the studio working on new material. The resulting Brimstone Sluggers -- the moniker that the duo operated under before becoming Crazy Town -- dropped in the summer of 2015. ~ Ed Nimmervoll, Rovi'\n",

      "'The SoCal alt-metal foursome Alien Ant Farm formed in 1996 with the raging singer/songwriter Dryden Mitchell, guitarist Terry Corso, bassist Tye Zamora, and drummer Mike Cosgrove. All were bored with their day jobs and sought something else to break them from corporate norms. Music allowed them to freely express themselves, and a friendship was born. They independently released their quirky debut, Greatest Hits, toward the end of the \\'90s and soon enough noise surrounded the band. It won the award for Best Independent Album at the 1999 L.A. Music Awards and Alien Ant Farm found themselves striking a deal with Papa Roach\\'s New Noize, which is partners with DreamWorks. Two years later they made their major-label introduction with ANThology, issued in March 2001. Debut single \"Smooth Criminal\" was a funky metal mix of Michael Jackson\\'s original song, and pop kids of the TRL generation loved it. The song hit number one on the modern rock charts, and the album eventually went platinum. A year later, between tours of Europe, the band was back in the studio recording new music. Their new song \"Bug Bites\" was featured in the Tobey Maguire flick Spiderman in May 2002. But while traveling in Spain to a gig in Portugal that same month, the band\\'s bus collided with a truck, killing their driver, Christopher Holland. The band and crew members suffered various injuries as well, most seriously Mitchell, who fractured his C2 vertebra. Thankfully, he came out of surgery able to walk, though suffered some nerve damage and a slight loss of motion. Committed to getting back to work and pushing the incident aside, Alien Ant Farm hit the studio to record their follow-up record. truANT was issued in May 2003, right as Dreamworks was dissolving as a label. As a result, the album barely made a splash on the U.S. charts, though the single \"These Days\" managed to crack the Top 30. Guitarist Corso subsequently exited the group and was replaced by Joe Hill. Zamora next left for college after recording of the band\\'s fourth effort wrapped. Up in the Attic appeared in July 2006 on New Door Records, as hardcore vet Alex Barreto (Chain of Strength, Inside Out) entered on bass. Alien Ant Farm simultaneously released the DVD BUSted, which included music videos, live footage, and a candid documentary.Up In The Attic didn\\'t perform especially well and the group entered a period of uncertainty. Bassist Tye Zamora departed to attend college--he was replaced by Alex Barreto--but he came back along with Terry Corso in 2008. However, progress was not linear for AAF: there were sideprojects abound until they started to play shows in 2009 (the same year as their first live album, Alien Ant Farm: Live in Germany). The original lineup reunited in 2010 and played shows with regularity over the next three years. As they started recording a new album, Zamora left once again. He was replaced by Tim Peugh and with the new bassist aboard, they set out to record a new album. Called Always And Forever, the record came out in February 2015. ~ MacKenzie Wilson, Rovi'\n",

      "'The members of alternative metal outfit Finger Eleven grew up in Burlington, Ontario, and came together in high school as a funk-styled band named Rainbow Butt Monkeys. Originally comprising vocalist Scott Anderson, bassist Sean Anderson, drummer Rob Gommerman, and James Black and Rick Jackett on guitars, they won a rock band search contest on local radio and used the prize money to record their first album, 1995\\'s Letters from Chutney. Gommerman left the band soon after, making way for drummer Rich Beddoe. Now named Finger Eleven, the quintet released Tip on Mercury Records in Canada, which marked the band\\'s turn to a heavier sound. It was re-released by the New York City-based label Wind-Up Records in September 1998. The album made minor waves on MuchMusic, videos for \"Above\" and \"Tip\" increasing their profile at home, but it would still be several years before U.S. audiences really paid attention to the band. The Greyest of Blue Skies appeared in the summer of 2000, followed three years later by Finger Eleven\\'s self-titled third album. The latter record eventually went gold, driven by the success of their brooding Top 40 hit \"One Thing.\" After various rounds of touring, the guys got to work collectively writing their next album for Wind-Up. March 2007\\'s Them vs. You vs. Me featured much more varied instrumentation and influences -- including dance, funk, and country -- than just the chugging metallic guitars of Finger Eleven\\'s past efforts. The band subsequently hit the road in support with U.S. shows alongside Evanescence and Chevelle. Back home in Canada, Them vs. You vs. Me wound up winning the Juno for Rock Album of the Year in 2008, raising expectations for the band\\'s next album, the Juno Award-nominated Life Turns Electric, which appeared in the fall of 2010. Five Crooked Lines, the band\\'s seventh studio long-player, was released in 2015 and preceded by the single \"Wolves and Doors.\" ~ Roxanne Blanford'\n",

      "'Incubus became one of the most popular alt-metal bands of the new millennium, setting themselves apart from a crowded field with a tireless touring ethic and a broad musical palette. Employing a versatile blend of heavy metal, funk, jazz, hip-hop, techno, post-grunge, and alternative rock, the band hit the mainstream in 1999 with their multi-platinum third album, Make Yourself, which featured the chart-topping single \"Drive.\" They continued their reign over the ensuing decade, issuing a string of gold- and platinum-selling records: Morning View (2001), A Crow Left of the Murder... (2004), and Light Grenades (2006), culminating in the release of a greatest-hits LP in 2009. Incubus spent the next decade focusing on playing live but also issued two more studio albums (2011\\'s If Not Now, When? and 2017\\'s 8) plus a handful of singles and EPs that continued to expand their sonic oeuvre.Formed in 1991 in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Calabasas, California, the band\\'s early lineup comprised tenth-grade classmates Brandon Boyd (vocals, percussion), Mike Einziger (guitar), Alex Katunich (aka Dirk Lance; bass), and José Pasillas (drums). Their early funk-metal sound was heavily influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but broadened over the next few years to incorporate thrash, rap-metal, post-grunge rock, and grinding alt-metal à la Korn or the Deftones. By the time the musicians had graduated from high school, they had already been playing all-ages shows around Southern California on a regular basis. In 1995, Incubus added hip-hop turntablist DJ Lyfe (aka Gavin Koppel) to their lineup and recorded the independently released album Fungus Amongus. That, coupled with a strong local following, helped the band earn a deal with the Epic Records subsidiary Immortal.Incubus\\' first major-label release was the six-song EP Enjoy Incubus, which was released in early 1997 and consisted of previous demos that were revamped in the studio. Their full-length debut album, S.C.I.E.N.C.E., followed before the year\\'s end. Incubus then hit the road with a vengeance, opening for bands like Korn, Primus, 311, Sublime, and Unwritten Law. They had amassed enough of a following by 1998 to land a slot on that summer\\'s Ozzfest tour, and they rounded out the year with a stint on Korn\\'s inaugural Family Values tour, by which time DJ Lyfe had departed and been replaced by DJ Kilmore (first name Chris). With their momentum and exposure slowly building, Incubus returned to the studio and delivered their follow-up album, Make Yourself, in late 1999. The group went right back out on the road, and their stint on the 2000 Ozzfest helped cement the new audience that the band\\'s new single, \"Pardon Me,\" was pulling in. Although Make Yourself barely broke the Top 50 on the album charts, it was a tenacious seller that eventually pushed past the double-platinum mark. The second single, \"Stellar,\" was a smaller-sized hit on rock radio, but the album\\'s biggest song didn\\'t hit the airwaves until 2001, when \"Drive\" became their first Top Ten hit on the pop charts. Incubus expanded their audience by playing Moby\\'s Area:One package tour that summer, and with \"Drive\" still fresh in the public\\'s mind, they released Morning View during the fall of 2001. It entered the charts at number two, confirming that Incubus had diligently worked themselves into stardom. \"Wish You Were Here,\" \"Nice to Know You,\" and \"Warning\" were all popular on rock radio, and the band naturally toured heavily in support, this time as a headliner. In early 2003, Incubus became embroiled in a contract dispute with Sony and filed a lawsuit to have their deal terminated under California labor laws. In April, the band announced the departure of bassist Dirk Lance. Within days, fellow Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger called upon his Time Lapse Consortium mate Ben Kenney (who had also played with the Roots) to be Lance\\'s permanent replacement. The group remained a part of the Sony empire, however, and released A Crow Left of the Murder... on Epic/Immortal in early 2004, which hit number two on the Billboard Top 200. Touring dates followed before Incubus headed home in November to take a well-deserved break. The guys spent the next two years individually exploring things outside of the band -- including music, art, film, and literature -- though they also remembered to work on and finish their sixth album, which was recorded over a year\\'s time in both L.A. and Atlanta. The resulting record, Light Grenades, debuted atop the charts upon its release in November 2006. The musicians then returned to their individual endeavors, with Boyd announcing in early 2008 that the group had taken a loose hiatus. Nevertheless, the following year found them issuing the double-LP hits compilation Monuments and Melodies and returning to the road for a summer tour. By 2010, they\\'d returned to the studio with longtime collaborator Brendan O\\'Brien, who helped them compose one of their darker albums to date, 2011\\'s If Not Now, When? The album debuted at number two on the Billboard charts upon its July 2011 release.As promotion for If Not Now, When?, Incubus rented a storefront on LaBrea Avenue in Los Angeles and launched a multimedia retrospective of their career, highlighted by four nights of live music by the band. Selections from those four nights were compiled for the 2012 live album Incubus HQ Live, released in August of that year. In early 2015 the band released a new single called \"Absolution Calling,\" which would appear on Trust Fall (Side A), the first of two planned EPs. February 2017 saw the release of a new single, \"Nimble Bastard,\" in anticipation of their eighth studio album. Aptly named 8 and co-produced by Skrillex, it dropped in April, preceded by a further single, \"Glitterbomb.\" The following year saw the band issue the single \"Into the Summer\" and celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Make Yourself with a massive U.S. tour. A second single, \"Our Love,\" arrived in early 2020. Both of these tracks landed on the sequel to their 2015 EP, Trust Fall (Side B), which was released that April. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "'Texas-bred outfit Flyleaf broke onto the hard rock circuit in the late 2000s with potent anthems that grappled with the struggle between despair and hope. Though their lyrics sometimes hinted at their faith-based backgrounds, the messages were universal, delivered with howls, screams, and the soaring vocals of Lacey Sturm. Into the 2010s, their albums dominated the U.S. alternative, hard rock, and Christian charts, with their 2005 debut Flyleaf earning platinum certification. After the release of their third set, 2012\\'s New Horizons, Sturm left the group to focus on family and a brief solo career, with Kristen May taking vocal duties for just one album, 2014\\'s Between the Stars. In 2022, after an extended hiatus, Flyleaf returned with Sturm in tow, issuing a deluxe edition of their hit debut and charting a series of reunion shows.The band formed in 2000 in Belton, Texas when Sturm (née Mosley) played a string of the dark, hard-edged songs she wrote as a teen for drummer James Culpepper. After a brief period of playing together, they recruited guitarists Sameer Bhattacharya and Jared Hartmann, members of a local outfit that had recently called it quits. In 2002, bassist Pat Seals joined, and the band, initially known as Passerby, was born. The road to Flyleaf\\'s 2005 self-titled debut on Octone Records was dotted with more green lights than red: the band played wherever they were invited around their home state at first, gradually building the kind of fan base that allowed them to open for acts such as Bowling for Soup, Fishbone, and Riddlin\\' Kids. By 2003, with word of Mosley\\'s arsenic-laced lyrics and blowtorch-style delivery spreading through Texas and beyond, Flyleaf earned a spot at the annual South by Southwest Music Conference. A contract from Octone was rushed into the signing stages by 2004. An EP, issued in early 2005 and also called Flyleaf, benefited from the production team of Rick Parashar (Pearl Jam, Blind Melon) and Brad Cook (Foo Fighters, Queens of the Stone Age). Key tracks such as the roiling \"Cassie\" and the emo-tinged \"Breathe Today,\" both of which appear on the full-length, furthered Flyleaf\\'s reputation, as did raging live shows alongside Saliva, Breaking Benjamin, 3 Doors Down, and Staind. For the late 2005 full-length release, producer Howard Benson (My Chemical Romance, Papa Roach, the All-American Rejects) joined Flyleaf in Los Angeles. A batch of 20 songs was winnowed down to 12, with Mosley\\'s searing vocals and Bhattacharya\\'s and Hartmann\\'s storming guitars offsetting each other to affect a sound by turns morose, compassionate, hopeful, and bitter.Following the release of Flyleaf, the band toured heavily on the festival circuit. They hit the main stage on Korn\\'s 2006 and 2007 Family Values Tour, as well as the Soundwave Festival and Disturbed\\'s Music as a Weapon III tour. They also made a jump to the world of video games when their breakthrough single \"I\\'m So Sick\" -- also a hit on MTV -- was put in the first installment of the Rock Band series and their single, \"Tina,\" debuted in Guitar Hero 3. Meanwhile, \"All Around Me\" was certified platinum and remains their lone song to chart on the Hot 100 to date.After taking some time out of their hectic touring schedule to record, Flyleaf released their sophomore album, Memento Mori, in 2009. The LP topped the Alternative, Hard Rock, and Christian charts in the U.S. and entered the Top Ten on the Billboard 200; singles \"Again,\" \"Chasm,\" and \"Arise\" all topped the Christian singles chart. The following year, Flyleaf delivered the EP Remember to Live, featuring stripped-down, reworked versions of some of the group\\'s early songs. In 2012 the band released its third studio album, the Howard Benson-produced New Horizons, after which Sturm and the band amicably parted ways. Kristen May, former lead singer for the band Vedora, was recruited as vocalist, and the May-fronted version of Flyleaf recorded a single, \"Something Better,\" for their 2013 EP Who We Are. Between the Stars, the band\\'s fourth long-player and first outing for Loud &amp; Proud Records, arrived the following year. It would be May\\'s lone full-length with the group; after four years with the band, she announced her departure in August 2016.Without a vocalist, Flyleaf went on an extended hiatus, with the individual bandmembers pursuing other musical ventures. Five years passed before anything was heard from the crew, but the wait was worth it for longtime fans. Hinting at the return of Sturm, Flyleaf officially announced their reunion in 2022. In addition to the release of a deluxe version of their debut -- which included B-sides and acoustic versions of their big singles -- they also revealed plans for a return to the live circuit, billed as \"Flyleaf with Lacey Sturm.\" ~ Neil Z.

      "'A platinum-selling country rap-rocker, Detroit native Kid Rock shot to superstardom in 1998 with his fourth full-length LP, Devil Without a Cause. Known for hits like \"Cowboy,\" \"Picture,\" \"Bawitdaba,\" and \"All Summer Long,\" Rock had recorded his first demo ten years prior, been booted off major label Jive following his 1990 debut, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast, and toiled for most of the decade in obscurity, releasing albums to a small, devoted, primarily local fan base. He persevered, and by the time rap-metal began to attract a substantial audience, he had perfected the outlandish, over-the-top persona that gave Devil Without a Cause such a distinctive personality and made it such an infectious party record. Subsequent efforts like Cocky (2001), Rock N Roll Jesus (2007), and Sweet Southern Sugar (2017) saw him continue to blur the lines between rock, hip hop, country, and heavy metal. In 2021 he released the confrontational single \"Don\\'t Tell Me How to Live\" ahead of the arrival of his 12th studio album, Bad Reputation, which appeared in 2022. Bob \"Kid Rock\" Ritchie (born Robert James Ritchie, January 17, 1971) grew up in Romeo, Michigan, a small rural town north of the Detroit metro area. Finding small-town life stiflingly dull, Ritchie immersed himself in rap music, learned to breakdance, and began making the talent-show rounds in Detroit. Inspired by the Beastie Boys\\' Licensed to Ill -- white performers fusing rap and hard guitar rock -- Kid Rock recorded his first demos in 1988, and eventually scored an opening slot at a Boogie Down Productions gig. That performance, in turn, led to a contract with Jive Records, which issued Kid Rock\\'s debut album, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast, in 1990. Produced by Kid Rock, Too $hort, and D-Nice, the album was heavily derivative of Licensed to Ill. Rock briefly became notorious when a New York college radio station aired the album\\'s profanity-laced ode to oral sex, \"Yodelin\\' in the Valley,\" and was fined over $20,000 (a judgment later rescinded). However, despite a tour with Too $hort and Ice Cube, Jive didn\\'t see much of a future for Kid Rock and dropped him from their roster.Moving to Brooklyn, Rock hooked up with the small Continuum label, and moved his brand of rap further into hard rock with The Polyfuze Method, released in 1993. Reviews were mixed, with some critics praising the record\\'s humor and eclecticism while others dismissed it as awkward and forced. The EP Fire It Up followed in 1994, appearing on Rock\\'s own Top Dog imprint (which was still distributed by Continuum). Rock eventually returned to the Detroit area and began work on another album; recorded on a shoestring budget: Early Mornin\\' Stoned Pimp was released in 1996. Although sometimes forced to sell bootleg dubs of his own records to pay the rent, Rock set about forming a full-fledged backing band, which he dubbed Twisted Brown Trucker. While its membership fluctuated early on, rapper Joe C. (born Joseph Calleja) was one of the first to join; a longtime fan and frequent concert attendee, Calleja caught Rock\\'s eye in 1994, partly because of his diminutive stature (due to a digestive condition known as celiac disease, which required both dialysis and extensive medication) and partly because of his encyclopedic knowledge of Rock\\'s song lyrics. The rest of the lineup settled around mostly Detroit-area musicians: guitarists Kenny Olson and Jason Krause, keyboardist Jimmy Bones (born Jimmy Trombly, he handles the basslines himself), drummer Stefanie Eulinberg, DJ/turntablist Uncle Kracker (born Matt Shafer, who had been with Rock since the early \\'90s), and backing vocalists Misty Love and Shirley Hayden.As rap-metal acts like Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Rage Against the Machine began to dominate the hard rock landscape, Atlantic Records decided to take a chance on signing Rock. Devil Without a Cause didn\\'t do much upon its initial release in August 1998, but a big promotional push from the label and MTV helped make the album\\'s second single and video, \"Bawitdaba,\" a nationwide smash. The follow-up, \"Cowboy,\" achieved similar success, and suddenly, after a decade of trying, Kid Rock was a superstar with a Top Five, seven-times-platinum album and a gig at Woodstock 1999. While pondering how to follow up Devil, Rock acquired the rights to his indie label recordings and remixed or re-recorded the best material for The History of Rock, which was released in the summer of 2000 and featured some new songs as well. Sadly, after being forced to take a break from touring a year earlier by his medical difficulties, Joe C. passed away in his sleep on November 16, 2000.Even with a tragedy like this in his life, Rock continued work on his follow-up to Devil Without a Cause. The media focused more on his relationship with actress Pamela Anderson than his musical career, which many magazines were beginning to ridicule. His DJ, Uncle Kracker, had a successful solo career during the spring and summer of 2001, leaving Rock without one of his most frequent collaborators. Still, by the winter of that year he had completed work on Cocky and had released \"Forever\" to success on rock radio. In fall 2003, Kid Rock returned with a self-titled effort. A cover of Bad Company\\'s \"Feel Like Makin\\' Love\" marked the first single. The cover art to his 2006 live album, Live Trucker, paid tribute to Bob Seger\\'s Live Bullet. Just a year later, the studio record Rock N Roll Jesus came out, landing at number one and selling 172,000 copies in its first week. Born Free, produced by Rick Rubin and featuring guest appearances by Martina McBride, Trace Adkins, Zac Brown, Sheryl Crow, Bob Seger, James Hetfield, and T.I., arrived in 2010. Born Free debuted at number five on the Billboard charts but it didn\\'t generate any hit singles; the title track peaked at 31 on the rock songs chart and \"Collide,\" featuring Crow and Seger, didn\\'t fare much better on the country and adult contemporary charts. Rock toured in 2011, then set about recording his next album, Rebel Soul, which appeared late in 2012. Entering the Billboard charts at number five, Rebel Soul eventually went gold but spawned no big hits. In 2013, Rock inaugurated his \"Best Night Ever\" tour, where he capped all ticket prices at $20.00. He moved over to Warner in 2014 and started work on his next album, the self-produced First Kiss, which saw release in February 2015. Kid Rock left Warner after First Kiss, signing with the country-oriented label Broken Bow Records. In July of 2017, he released his first two singles for the label -- \"Po-Dunk\" and \"Greatest Show on Earth,\" both released on the same day -- but they were overshadowed by rumors that Rock planned to run for the U.S. Senate in his home state of Michigan. Rock dismissed those rumors on the October 24 episode of the Howard Stern Show, saying his next project was promoting Sweet Southern Sugar, an album released in November 2017. His 11th full-length, the set broke into the Billboard 200 Top Ten, while topping the Top Rock and Independent Albums charts, and rising to number four on the Top Country list. Rock\\'s first career overview, Greatest Hits: You Never Saw Coming, appeared in 2018, and in 2020 he issued the old-school hip-hop single \"Quarantine\" under the moniker DJ Bobby Shazam. The fiery \"Don\\'t Tell Me How to Live,\" featuring the band Monster Truck, arrived late the following year, with \"We The People,\" \"The Last Dance,\" and \"Rockin\\'\" arriving in early 2022. All four tracks appeared on Rock\\'s 12th long-player, Bad Reputation, which was released later that spring. ~ Steve Huey &amp; James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "'Alternative metal outfit Trust Company (also referred to as TRUSTcompany and TRUST*CO) formed in Montgomery, AL, circa 1997 around Kevin Palmer (vocals/guitar) and Jason Singleton (drums). The two met after high school, initially playing in a local band together before breaking off to create their own group. Distinguishing themselves from the alt-rock pack in their merger of melody with guitar-driven metal, the group took influence from the likes of Pantera, the Smashing Pumpkins, and the Deftones. With Josh Moates on bass, the band played for three years as a trio; they recruited second guitarist James Fukai in 2000. Self-described as weekend warriors who refused to play covers, the guys played wherever people would have them, aptly covering the Southeast (and as far west as Texas) in their efforts to get noticed and get signed. Eventually hooking up with Dcide Records, Trust Company later found themselves on the roster at Geffen. Originally called 41 Down, the band would change its name to Trust Company prior to releasing its debut full-length to avoid confusion with Canadian pop-punkers Sum 41. The Lonely Position of Neutral appeared in mid-2002 and produced two moderately successful singles, \"Downfall\" and \"Running from Me.\" Tours with bands like Korn, 30 Seconds to Mars, and Papa Roach followed, and the album was eventually certified gold. Trust Company followed up three years later with True Parallels, and supporting tours marked the debut of new bassist Walker Warren. Palmer exited the group in August 2005 for personal reasons; the band broke up soon afterward. Palmer and Moates went on to form Amity Lane with Palmer\\'s wife, Layla, while Fukai turned his attention to the instrumental metal group Hematovore. ~ Corey Apar, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Known for their theatrical live show and the black masks that most of their members wear on-stage, Mushroomhead are one of the more unique and adventurous alternative metal outfits that emerged in the 1990s. The band's forceful yet melodic alternative metal incorporates elements of hip-hop, punk, and goth rock as well as industrial and techno. Since releasing their eponymous debut in 1995, Mushroomhead have sold over two million albums worldwide, with highlights arriving via 2003's XIII, 2006's Savior Sorrow, and 2014's The Righteous &amp; the Butterfly. The members of Mushroomhead have been performing incognito since 1993, when drummer Skinny founded the band. At first, Mushroomhead were only meant to be a side project. Their members were playing in various local bands at the time, and they wore the blacks masks (which look like a cross between S&amp;M/bondage masks and World War I gas masks) so that people wouldn't recognize them. The only Mushroomhead member who doesn't wear a black mask opts for Kiss-like clown makeup instead. After a few years, the group became one of Cleveland's top local attractions -- and the bandmembers kept wearing the masks when they saw how intriguing people found them to be. Mushroomhead's self-titled debut album was released independently in 1995, followed by Superbuick in 1996 and M3 in 1999. The Midwesterners signed with Eclipse in 2000, and their next record, XX, came out the following year. In 2001, Mushroomhead's members included drummer/founder Skinny, lead vocalists J-Mann and Jeffrey Nothing, guitarists Bronson and Gravy, keyboardist Shmotz, bassist Pig Benis, and sample provider Stitch when they signed to Universal Records to re-release XX. Their first proper effort for the label was 2003's dynamic XIII, but the band soon parted ways with not only Universal but also vocalist J-Mann during a subsequent tour. Undeterred, Mushroomhead pressed on with their D.I.Y. ethos intact and welcomed new frontman Waylon, formerly of 3 Quarters Dead, into the fray. The concert film Mushroomhead, Vol. 1 followed in mid-2005 before the group returned in September 2006 with the critically acclaimed Savior Sorrow, released through New York-based indie Megaforce Records. Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children, the band's seventh studio album, arrived in 2010, followed in 2014 by The Righteous &amp; the Butterfly, the latter of which became the group's first album to crack the Top 20 of the Billboard Top 200. 2020's A Wonderful Life introduced new members Steve Rauckhorst and Jackie LaPonza (vocals), and Tom Shaffner (guitar), who replaced longtime vocalist Jeffrey Nothing and guitar player Tommy Church. It was Mushroomhead's eighth studio LP and first outing for Napalm Records. ~ Alex Henderson, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Kentucky\\'s Flaw deliver a dynamic and hard-driving amalgam of nu-metal, alternative metal, and hard rock. Citing influences like Tool, Pearl Jam, and Korn, the group emerged in the late \\'90s. Led by vocalist, frontman, and sole constant member Chris Volz, the band issued a handful of independent releases before moving into the mainstream in the early 2000s with the arrivals of Through the Eyes (2001) and Endangered Species (2004), both of which were released on Republic. Flaw ceased operations in 2005 but re-formed in 2016 and released a third studio album, Divided We Fall. Despite enduring periods of internal strife and myriad personnel changes, the band continued to ply their sonic wares on subsequent efforts Vol IV: Because of the Brave (2019) and Revival (2022). The core of Flaw got together in 1996 when Jason Daunt placed an ad for a guitarist and Chris Volz answered. Volz\\'s adoptive mother, an opera singer who had performed at the Kennedy Center, had helped develop his musical talent. After she committed suicide when Volz was 12, he spent years in various types of psychotherapy, gaining insights that bypass most people. It was from this experience that Volz shaped his personal style of lyrics, expressing how one gets through inner turmoil and hurt. Songs such as \"Inner Strength,\" \"Whole\" (a song about his mother\\'s death), and \"Only the Strong\" reflect his inner growth.Originally calling themselves F. Law, the bandmembers -- recognizing that everyone and everything has flaws -- dropped the period and became Flaw. In 1997, Ryan Jurhs (five-string bass, background vocals) joined Volz and Daunt, while the rest of the lineup remained in flux. Jurhs had just finished his stint with the Marines and was joining the music scene. Within a few weeks, Flaw recorded their first indie record, American Arrogance. Two of the eight tracks, \"Amendment\" and \"Reliance,\" were also on the band\\'s official debut album, Through the Eyes, which led Flaw to opening for bands such as Econoline Crush and Fear Factory. The band put out two more independent records, Flaw in 1998 and Drama EP in 2000, both of which were well-received. Flaw\\'s lineup firmed up in 1999 when Chris Ballinger (drums) and Lance Arny (guitar) came aboard. Arny tended toward being a technical player, while Daunt went for the impromptu odd sounds, and Volz aimed his lyrics at the healing process in life and childhood. The combination worked.In 2000, Flaw showcased at New York City\\'s CBGB, where Republic/Universal heard them and signed them up. With David Bottrill (who had taken Tool and Peter Gabriel to the top) as their producer, Flaw began recording at Sound City in Los Angeles in early 2001. Republic/Universal released Flaw\\'s official debut album, Through the Eyes, in October 2001 in both clean and explicit versions. While the album had a hint of a Tool influence, the uniqueness of Flaw remained solid and the album received rave reviews. The album topped Billboard\\'s Heatseekers chart, and the group participated in the 2002 Ozzfest tour. Daunt was dismissed from the band that year, and Ballinger was replaced by Micah Havertape in 2003.With their revamped lineup, Flaw recorded their second album, Endangered Species, which appeared in 2004 and became their highest-charting effort to date. However, Flaw\\'s label wasn\\'t happy with the album\\'s performance and dropped the band, who subsequently broke up. Volz formed Five.Bolt.Main with early Flaw drummer Ivan Arnold, and Rock Ridge Music put out their debut album, Venting, in 2005. Volz, Daunt, and Ballinger re-formed Flaw in 2006 and played a reunion show in March of 2007, followed by a tour. Volz released a solo album, Redemption, and he and Daunt briefly started an offshoot called Foundation before returning to Flaw.After shuffling through additional short-term bandmembers and failing to find support from a record label for their new material, Flaw independently released their next album, Home Grown Studio Sessions, in November of 2009. The album was recorded by Volz, Arny, Jurhs, guitarist Andy Russ, and drummer Sean Rued. Flaw toured into 2010, sometimes with additional bassist/guitarist Chris Marple, but they became inactive by the end of the year.In 2013, the Through the Eyes lineup of Flaw reunited and began writing new material, as well as reworking a few of their older songs. They began touring in 2019, although Arny left the group, and Ballinger was eventually dismissed and replaced by drummer Corey Sturgill. Flaw worked with producer Skidd Mills on their next album, eventually signing with Pavement Entertainment in 2015. Divided We Fall appeared in August of 2016, and charted in the Billboard 200. Following additional lineup changes, the group released an EP of b-sides titled United We Stand in 2017, followed closely by the full-length Divided We Fall, which was issued by Pavement Music. Vol IV: Because of the Brave appeared in 2019, with the covers LP Revival arriving in 2022. ~ Eleanor Ditzel, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Sevendust never follow a linear path. Instead, they continue to bulldoze a lane of their own with a proven one-two punch of rumbling grooves, unpredictable riffing, and stirringly soulful vocals unlike anything else in hard rock. As a result, their music connects straight to the heart as evidenced by their full-contact live shows and diehard “family” of fans. It's why they've been around since 1994, tallied global sales of seven million, logged three gold-selling albums, delivered three Top 15 debuts on the Billboard 200, and garnered a GRAMMY Award nomination in the category of “Best Metal Performance.” They're the rare force of nature who not only graced the bills of Woodstock and OZZfest, but also Shiprocked! and Sonic Temple and some of the largest stages around the globe. Along the way, they've notably collaborated with everyone from members of Deftones, Daughtry, and Staind to Alter Bridge, Periphery, and Xzibit. 2020 saw them deliver one of the most-acclaimed albums of their career with Blood &amp; Stone, which Metal Hammer christened “Sevendust's best work in years” and Outburn dubbed “everything a Sevendust fan could want.” However, the Atlanta quintet—Lajon Witherspoon [lead vocals], Clint Lowery [lead guitar, backing vocals], John Connolly [rhythm guitar, backing vocals], Vince Hornsby [bass], and Morgan Rose [drums]—defy expectations yet again on their fourteenth full-length and debut for Napalm Records, Truth Killer.\"\n",

      "\"Snot was formed in Santa Barbara sometime in 1995 by singer Lynn Strait (who had formerly played bass in local punk act Lethal Dose) and guitarist Mike Doling (formerly of Kronix). In 1996, Snot signed with Geffen Records after building a strong following with their powerful L.A. area performances, and shortly the group began work on their first full-length recording. The resulting disc, Get Some, was released in 1997 and immediately began receiving favorable notices. Get Some is a dynamic, hardcore metal offering that exhibits the punk and metal roots of Snot members Strait, Doling, bassist John Fahnestock, drummer Jamie Miller, and guitarist Sonny Mayo. Snot began touring in support of their new record and partly due to the fact that they were so very well received within the community of rock musicians, they were given a slot on the 1998 Ozzfest tour where Strait (among other dubious accomplishments no doubt) was arrested in Mansfield, MA, for indecent exposure after an onstage encounter with a member of Limp Bizkit's touring entourage. While Snot was running amok all over America, their debut wasn't getting quite as warm a reception as the band and their label would have liked, and after the Universal-Polygram merger, their future with the new company seemed to be in jeopardy as many lesser and new artists were being cut free from their contracts. Undaunted, the group continued to work on new music while pursuing whatever business and recording opportunities they found available to them. It was during this tough time for the band that Strait was killed in a car accident. On December 11, 1998 a truck struck the singer's car on the 101 freeway near Santa Barbara. Strait was 30 years old. Also killed in the accident was Strait's dog Dobbs, a boxer that appeared on the cover of Get Some. Fahnestock and Doling took the tracks that they had been working on with Strait at the time of his death and had friends of the singer come by (Korn's Jonathan Davis, Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, and Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath, among others) and lay down their own vocals as a tribute to the deceased. The subsequent Immortal Records release was called Straight Up. This record is a symbol of the tremendous outpouring of grief and sympathy -- especially within the L.A. new metal and alternative music community -- that was indeed massive and sustained. The vigilance of fans and concerted effort to sustain his legacy by other artists affirmed what many close to Strait had known for a longtime: that the singer had incredible magnetism and spirit, and that while he wasn't always an angel, he managed to inspire and entertain people. These were certainly among the man's goals, which he obviously accomplished during his lifetime. After the release of Strait Up, Fahnestock joined Amen and Doling signed on with Soulfly. ~ Vincent Jeffries, Rovi\"\n",

During this time they found themselves sharing the stage alongside of some of rock's biggest acts at the time.After Unstable, the band found itself facing major roadblocks in their future.

During the band\\'s early years, they released two demos, 1992\\'s unreleased Witches and Other Night Fears, and an untitled 1995 tape that fans christened This Is Only the Beginning; that year, the band also added drummer Juhana Tuomas Rantala to the fold. After signing a record contract with BMG, their first official release was 1996\\'s 666 Ways to Love: Prologue, a Finland-only release limited to 1,000 copies that featured the band\\'s cover of Chris Isaak\\'s \"Wicked Game.\"By the time of the group\\'s first album, 1997\\'s Greatest Lovesongs, Vol. 666, they had shortened their name to H.I.M. and recruited keyboardist Antto Einari Melasniemi. The album earned the band a cult following in their homeland, one that spread to the rest of Europe with 2009\\'s Razorblade Romance. Featuring the single \"Join Me in Death\" -- which became the best-selling Finnish single in history -- the album topped the German and Finnish charts. When the album was released in the U.S. in 2002, a legal challenge initially resulted in the band going under the HER moniker until they bought the full rights to the H.I.M. name; 1000 copies of the American version of Razorblade Romance were pressed with the HER name. H.I.M. also won a fan in professional skater Bam Margera, who took every opportunity to promote the band\\'s music on his popular MTV series Viva La Bam. In 2001, Valo, Lindström, and Paananen formed the side project Daniel Lioneye, which featured Lindström on vocals and guitars, Valo on drums, and Paananen on bass; the project\\'s debut album The King of Rock \\'n\\' Roll arrived that September.

      "'Over the course of the 1990s, Sweden\\'s Tiamat evolved from a typical death metal outfit into one of the leading lights in \"symphonic\" black metal. A variation that aimed to keep all of death metal\\'s darkness intact, symphonic black metal portrayed that darkness it in a moodier, atmospheric manner, often making synthesizer arrangements just as important as guitar riffs and utilizing a deliberate, Gothic feel. The one constant throughout Tiamat\\'s history has been the presence of vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist Johan Edlund, originally known as Hellslaughter in the band\\'s early days. Tiamat grew out of a splatter-metal band called Treblinka, which was formed in 1988 and released two demos (Crawling in Vomits and Sign of the Pentagram) that helped secure a deal with England\\'s CMFT label. Electing to change their name to Tiamat (an ancient Middle Eastern goddess of chaos and a five-headed dragon in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game), the group released their debut album, Sumerian Cry, in 1990, with a lineup of Edlund, bassist Jorgen \"Juck\" Thullberg, and session musicians Stefan \"Emetic\" Lagergren (guitar) and Andres \"Najse\" Holmberg. Dissatisfied with the album\\'s distribution, Tiamat jumped to the Century Media label and completed their official lineup with guitarist Thomas Petersson and drummer Niklas Ekstrand. The band worked with producer Waldemar Sorychta and engineer Siggi Bemm on their Century Media debut, 1991\\'s The Astral Sleep. The album displayed substantial musical growth, blending aggressive death metal with ponderous goth metal and more atmospheric, restrained passages courtesy of session keyboardist Jonas Malmsten. The follow-up, 1993\\'s Clouds, expanded on the latter aspect of the group\\'s music in particular, throwing acoustic guitars into the mix; the lineup on Clouds was revamped, with the addition of full-time keyboardist Kenneth Roos and bassist Johnny Hagel replacing Thullberg. Following the 1994 tour EP The Sleeping Beauty: Live in Israel, Edlund fired the remainder of the band, save for Hagel, due to dissatisfaction with the group\\'s musical progress. With session musicians Magnus Sahlgren (guitar) and Lars Sköld (drums) in tow, as well as producer Sorychta manning the keyboards, Tiamat began work on the epic Wildhoney in 1994. Released later that year, Wildhoney became the group\\'s artistic and commercial breakthrough, fully realizing the sound hinted at on previous releases and eliciting effusive praise in metal circles for its brooding, Gothic atmospherics. The sound was often described as death metal meeting Pink Floyd, a connection made explicit with a cover of that band\\'s \"When You\\'re In\" on 1995\\'s Gaia EP, which otherwise featured four remixes/edits of Wildhoney cuts. Following the supporting tour, Edlund moved permanently to Dortmund, Germany, where most of the band\\'s albums had been recorded; he also changed the group\\'s focus, turning Tiamat into more of a personal mouthpiece and studio creation and declaring himself the only official member. Sköld remained as the band\\'s session drummer, with Petersson returning as session guitarist; Hagel left to join Cemetary, which quickly morphed into Sundown, and Cemetary/Sundown bassist Anders Iwers switched over to Tiamat. 1997\\'s A Deeper Kind of Slumber was conceived on Edlund\\'s home studio and produced by Dirk Draeger (Morgoth); it found Edlund moving into largely electronic territory and addressing more personal subject matter. Skeleton Skeleton followed in 1999, and divided their audience with it\\'s new approach. Where previous efforts had hinted at their goth tendencies, this album proudly displayed the deep vocals and shimmering guitars that are often associated with the genre. Still, a few crushing songs maintained their original sound and many were curious about their next step. 2002\\'s Judas Christ cemented their change into a goth rock band, doing away with all but a few minor elements of heavy metal and offering an album that was based in the Nosferatu/Sisters of Mercy school of songwriting. Recorded at Copenhagen\\'s Puk Recording Studio, the album also displayed an affirming and positive message, something the band had never really shown on any previous releases. Prey followed in 2003 and marked the band\\'s final effort for Century Media Records; they jumped ship several years later, ultimately signing with Nuclear Blast Records before issuing Amanethes in 2008. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

They have embraced the concept of growing through rejuvenation to soothe their blackened hearts and scarred souls—coming back stronger than ever after their hiatus with City Burials in April 2020. On their latest journey, Sky Void of Stars, the band solemnly set the stage for a nocturne both crushing and exhilarating. Yet at the very core of this entity, there still lingers the essence of their remarkable passage through time and space. Their music is pure and heartfelt from the northern wilderness; cast in mournful dirges for a world that needs renaissance.Their long way out of the darkness and into our hearts has taken up many shapes ever since their first two genre-bending milestones: Dance of December Souls (1993) and the unforgettable and oft-copied classic Brave Murder Day (1996). Whatever you might call their artful and soul-searching tunes ever since these records, they have always remained true to the very principles of musicality over scene, progression over deadlock, and collective over ego.'\n",

After nearly a decade of silence, Daniel Brennare, head and heart of the Swedish pioneers of dark music, finally reveals his sinister world of thought. Out of long years and intricate mathematics comes Ominous.Rooted in illness and depression, in days of grey. These moments, burdensome and overwhelming, are dissected and then reassembled into a linear story. Interwoven in sound, word and vision, with thought out precision.Lasting no longer than a morning but holding an eon. Reaching no further than to the horizon but holding a cosmos. Brennare creates his vision at the end of the world, starring the cosmonaut and the ominous brothers.He combines gothic rock with post-punk tunes, and quiet melancholic sounds that grow into powerful tracks, heavy and glutinous as liquid bitumen. Unhindered by the contemporary rules of form, LAKE OF TEARS present songs of unprecedented independence of mind.The foreboding of a coming doom is embedded in the words of Daniel ́s warm, fragile voice. “Ominous” was recorded and mixed in Studiomega in Sweden by Christian Silver and his team, and produced by Daniel Brennare.'\n",

In particular, the powerful vocal growls of Anders Jacobsson, one of the band's defining and most unique features, along with Heike Langhans's melodic and atmospheric female vocals. The band delivered six studio albums so far, with which they immediately convince the listener with Beauty and the Beast-esque vocal contrasts, striking accents, and threatening moods.Anno 2020, once again bringing agony to an end, “Under a Godless Veil” is set to be released in October 2020. By far the most diverse album they have created. From traditional Doom to scaled-down, Gothic rock-inspired pieces and more, some will perhaps describe the songs as more refined and meditative. Some ambient elements have been added to the mix without overshadowing the traditional characteristics that are DRACONIAN.Resonating with the compositions, Anders's lyrical direction is ambiguous and a progression of the first two-three albums, yet more subtle while embracing the Gnostic philosophy more directly. One could say DRACONIAN's “Under a Godless Veil” is an act of contemplation; About living and dying and remembering who we are in a strange, abrasive world far from home.\"\n",

      "\"The Finnish heavy metal band Sentenced released its debut album, Shadows of the Past, in the early '90s on a small French label; dissatisfied with their somewhat commonplace black-metal sound, they hired bassist/vocalist Taneli Jarva to provide more originality for 1992's North From Here. The record was more melodic and technically competent and got the band noticed in Sweden; it was followed in 1993 by a four-song EP, The Trooper, the title tune a cover of Iron Maiden's classic. This marked the beginning of a shift toward an even more melodic, British metal-influenced style, fleshed out on 1995's Amok and the additional EP Love and Death. Jarva left the band at this point, leaving guitarist Miika Tenkula and new vocalist Ville Laihiala as the musical focus of Sentenced. 1997's Down was the first effort by this revamped lineup; it was followed in 1998 by Story: A Recollection, a best-of compilation.

      "'The 69 Eyes are a dramatic goth metal band from Finland, with a dash of punk in their attitude and a sound that mixes polish with power. Drawing influence from bands like Motörhead, the Stooges, the Dead Boys, and the Doors, as well as movies like The Crow, The Lost Boys, and The Matrix, the band dabbled in glam metal-influenced, guitar-fueled decadence on early recordings like 1995\\'s Savage Garden. Just a few years later, though, as evidenced by 2000\\'s Blessed Be, the songs and the production showed much stronger goth leanings, and by 2009\\'s Back in Blood, the goth stylings were strengthened by a hard-hitting industrial undercurrent that packed a much stronger punch.The 69 Eyes were formed in 1989 in Helsinki by Jyrki 69 (aka Jyrki Pekka Emil Linnankivi) on lead vocals, Bazie (aka Pasi Moilanen) on lead guitar, Timo-Timo (aka Timo Tapio Pitkänen) on rhythm guitar, and Archzie (aka Arto Väinö Ensio Ojajärvi) on bass. They initially worked with a drummer named Lotto, and not long after they recorded their first demo, they were signed to the Finnish hard rock label Gaga Goodies. However, after releasing their first two singles, 1990\\'s \"Superman\" and 1991\\'s \"Barbarella,\" Lotto dropped out after he lost interest in touring and Jussi 69 (aka Jussi Heikki Tapio Vuori) took over on drums. Jussi was on board for the recording of their first album, 1992\\'s Bump \\'n\\' Grind, and two albums appeared in 1995: Savage Garden, a set of fresh studio recordings, and Motor City Resurrection, a collection of early singles and rare tracks. With 1997\\'s Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams, the 69 Eyes began easing back on their glam influences and bringing a stronger goth thread to their sound. With 1999\\'s Wasting the Dawn, the group was signed in several territories by the successful hard rock label Roadrunner Records, and 2000\\'s Blessed Be became their commercial breakthrough when the track \"Gothic Girl\" was issued as a single and became their first record to go gold. Their next full-length, 2002\\'s Paris Kills, rose to the top of the charts in Finland and was a success in Germany, where the band was developing a growing following. EMI Finland added the 69 Eyes to their roster in time for 2004\\'s Devils, which once again topped the Finnish album charts and earned them a gold record. In 2005, the band set out on a lengthy international concert tour, and in 2006, they appeared in the United States for the first time, including an appearance on the TV series Last Call with Carson Daly. They returned to the United States in 2006; one of the shows from the American tour would be issued in 2008 on the album Hollywood Kills: Live at the Whisky a Go Go. The follow-up to Devils was naturally titled Angels, and it appeared in 2007, debuting at number one on the Finnish charts, while the group played 125 shows around the world that year to promote the LP. In 2009, the 69 Eyes traveled to Los Angeles to begin work on their ninth studio album, with Matt Hyde as producer. The LP, Back in Blood, came out in late August of that year; it included the single \"Dead Girls Are Easy,\" and as expected, plenty of live work followed, including their first performances in Australia. 2012 marked the release of the 69 Eyes\\' tenth album, fittingly titled X, and in the following year, they celebrated their success with a \"greatest-hits\" compilation titled The Best of Helsinki Vampires. The band took some time off and pursued outside projects over the next few years, but they returned in 2016 with a batch of original songs titled Universal Monsters. 2019 saw the act play the United States for the first time in ten years in advance of their 12th studio album, West End, which was scheduled for release on Friday, September 13. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'Featuring former Sentenced frontman Ville Laihiala, Poisonblack are a Finnish goth metal band that emerged to mainstream success in the mid-2000s. The band was founded in 2000 by Laihiala (born June 13, 1973, in Oulu, Finland), who at the time was the lead vocalist of Sentenced, a chart-topping Finnish metal band. Laihiala had made his debut as the frontman of Sentenced on the band\\'s fourth album, Down (1996). He sang on all five of the band\\'s subsequent albums on Century Media Records, including the chart-toppers Crimson (2000), The Cold White Light (2002), and The Funeral Album (2005), plus the swan song CD/DVD live album Buried Alive (2006), a double-disc recording of the final Sentenced concert, which took place on October 1, 2005. Toward the end of his tenure with Sentenced, Laihiala founded Poisonblack as a side project in which he could focus on playing guitar. The band is comprised of Janne Markus (guitar), Antti Remes (bass), Tarmo Kanerva (drums), and Marco Sneck (keyboards), in addition to Laihiala. He made his album debut with Poisonblack in 2003 on Escapexstacy, on which Charon singer Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto is featured on lead vocals. The album was a minor hit at best, and Laihiala resumed activity in Sentenced after its release. However, after the breakup of Sentenced in 2005, Laihiala resurrected Poisonblack and sang lead vocals himself this time. The resulting album, Lust Stained Despair (2006), was a huge success, reaching number two on the Finnish albums chart and spawning the Top Five hit single \"Rush.\" Third album A Dead Heavy Day (2008) couldn\\'t rival the blockbuster success of Lust Stained Despair, but it was popular all the same, reaching the Top Ten and spawning the single \"Bear the Cross.\" ~ Jason Birchmeier'\n",

First coming together in 1996, Tristania took the uncommon step of showcasing three separate vocalists of wildly divergent styles to represent their lyrics, these being operatic soprano Vibeke Stene, clean-singing counter-tenor Østen Bergøy, and harsh, black metal-style shrieker Morten Veland. The last also played guitar and composed most of Tristania's lush, symphonically enhanced goth metal, but also counted on the help of lead guitarist Anders H. Hidle, keyboardist Einar Moen, bassist Rune Østerhus, and drummer Kenneth Olsson to make it all reality. Tristania's eponymous EP was released in 1997, and further albums such as Widow's Weeds (1998) and Beyond the Veil (1999), as well as the Angina EP followed in quick succession, and always through Austria's Napalm label. All fared incredibly well across Europe, with Beyond the Veil in particular earning rave reviews, gaining them inroads into North and South America (where they have since toured extensively) and elevating Tristania to headliner status to boot. The band was dealt a potentially crippling blow, however, when Veland departed to form a new band called Sirenia. Yet, they surprised cynical observers by immediately hiring new vocalist Kjetil Ingebrigtsen and rebounding in style via 2001's World of Glass. A longer hiatus followed but, after indulging in numerous side projects, Tristania reconvened in 2004 to record a new album called simply Ashes, then released it through new label Steamhammer/SPV in January of the following year. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi\"\n",

Fresh out of high school, the teenager was already enamored with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, and particularly high-energy trios like black metal pioneers Venom and proto-thrashers Raven. Inspired by that movement\\'s D.I.Y. credo, Fischer renamed himself Tom Warrior, and along with bassist Steve Warrior and drummer Bruce Day, formed his first band, Hellhammer, in the fall of 1982. Less than a year later, and though still raw beyond description, the band\\'s demos -- now featuring bassist Martin Eric Ain and drummer Stephen Priestly -- had become surprisingly popular within the underground tape-trading community. In late 1983, start-up German label Noise Records signed them to a contract and included two of their tracks on its first release, a compilation of rising German metal bands appropriately called Death Metal. But Warrior and Ain felt that Hellhammer had already run its course and that the group\\'s extreme nature was too limiting for their increasingly mature compositions. Thus, with their gothic, pseudo-satanic image already coming into focus, in May 1984 they evolved into Celtic Frost.By October, the trio was in Berlin recording its first album, Morbid Tales, which cemented the group\\'s position as one of Europe\\'s most promising metal acts thanks to its still relatively straightforward -- but nevertheless excellent -- thrash metal attack. The sudden departure of Priestly also proved to be a blessing in disguise, as his replacement, American drummer Reed St. Mark, brought a confidence and musicianship that the group sorely needed. Amazingly, Celtic Frost had yet to play their first concert, so after putting the finishing touches on the Emperor\\'s Return EP, in April 1985 they performed a single warm-up show in their hometown of Zurich, then set out to tour across Germany and Austria. Now growing from strength to strength, Warrior decided to replace the increasingly unmotivated Ain with bassist Dominic Steiner for their second album, To Mega Therion. But he soon had second thoughts, and Ain returned after the album\\'s completion that fall. Its cover graced by original artwork from acclaimed Swiss artist H.R. Giger (of Alien fame), the album expanded Celtic Frost\\'s songwriting palette, furthered their growing reputation, and was followed by their first North American performance at the World War Three metal festival in Montreal. After the release of the Tragic Serenades EP in the summer of 1986, the band embarked upon its most extensive tour yet -- first through Europe (including their first visit to England) with Helloween and Grave Digger, then across America with Voivod and Running Wild. By the end of the year, Celtic Frost were poised to fulfill their seemingly destined promise with a groundbreaking third effort. On To Mega Therion, Warrior had begun experimenting with different musical styles (especially classical music and electronica), leading certain journalists to describe the band\\'s direction as \"avant-garde\" metal. Released in 1987, Into the Pandemonium would substantiate these claims and then some, introducing an unconventional collision of death metal brutality and symphonic overtones on its way to becoming one of the classic extreme metal albums of all time. Frost\\'s most defining and influential work, it paved the way for the evolution of European death metal as a full-fledged underground phenomenon over the next decade. American guitarist Ron Marks was brought in to flesh out Celtic Frost\\'s live assault, and their subsequent U.K. tour was a resounding success on all fronts. Now at the peak of their powers, Frost headed for America to undertake their biggest tour ever, but trouble was right around the corner. First the band\\'s high spirits were quickly dampened by personality clashes with new member Marks and, secondly, the tour itself became mired in organizational and financial difficulties almost from day one. By the time it finally concluded in New York City (where the road crew was forced to hold the group\\'s gear hostage in order to get paid by Noise Records), the band was on its last legs. Furious at their record company and completely burnt out from the long months of arduous roadwork, they had had enough: Celtic Frost effectively ceased to exist.Six months would pass before Warrior got over his disillusionment and was convinced to resurrect Celtic Frost by Swiss guitarist Oliver Amberg. After drafting bassist Curt Victor Bryant and bringing back founding drummer Stephen Priestly, the revamped unit entered Berlin\\'s Sky Trak studios in the summer of 1988 with producer Tony Platt to begin sessions for the now infamous Cold Lake album. Warrior\\'s lingering indifference and lack of commitment to the project allowed Amberg and Platt\\'s commercial tendencies to run wild. In what has since been viewed as one of the most misguided changes in artistic direction in heavy metal history, the duo subverted Frost\\'s ferocious extreme metal roar into a sugar-coated pop-metal whimper. If this weren\\'t bad enough, the group then signed their own death sentence by adopting a glam rock image, complete with teased hair, makeup, and colorful outfits to match! The repercussions were instantaneous and devastating; press and consumers alike burned the band in effigy as an utter sellout, and what was expected to be a triumphant world tour turned into a protracted, embarrassing agony for all involved. Following this unmitigated disaster, Tom Gabriel Fischer (as he\\'d once again been calling himself after retiring his Warrior-like qualities) began backpedaling as fast as he could. Assuming control of the group once again, he fired Amberg and lured guitarist Ron Marks back to the fold for 1990\\'s back-to-basics Vanity/Nemesis LP. Marks remained as unreliable as always, though, and would soon exit, forcing Bryant to switch from bass to guitar and opening the door for Martin Eric Ain\\'s return. As for Vanity/Nemesis, it was a respectable semi-return to form that attempted to pick up where Into the Pandemonium had left off and make believe Cold Lake had never happened, but it ultimately couldn\\'t undo the damage done to the band\\'s reputation. After a troubled European tour, Frost planned to return to America for the first time in three years, but when a new recording deal with major label EMI (which had finally severed the band\\'s long-troubled ties to Noise) fell through due to corporate restructuring, Celtic Frost found themselves dropped and, still in shock, decided to call it a day. Their final act was compiling a collection of hits and album leftovers for 1992\\'s Parched with Thirst Am I and Dying -- its bizarre title taken, in typically quirky Frost fashion, from a fourth century Roman poem. Fischer would avoid the spotlight completely for the next few years before resurfacing in the late \\'90s with a new band called Apollyon Sun, but when this too ground to a halt amid widespread public indifference, he once again connected with Martin Ain, and quietly set about planning Celtic Frost\\'s resurrection. Working mostly in seclusion and avoiding all external intervention or financing, the duo -- plus new drummer Franco Sesa -- slowly recorded enough material for a comeback album to be titled Monotheist, which they eventually licensed to Century Media and released to much well-deserved fanfare in early 2006 -- just over 20 years after their debut. ~ Eduardo Rivadavia, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Characterized by songs that are dark, melancholy, pessimistic, and full of gloom and despair, the Foreshadowing are among the many goth metal bands that have come out of Italy. They have been compared to Depeche Mode more than once -- and while Depeche Mode were never a metal band and were never goth in the classic Bauhaus/Sisters of Mercy sense, the Foreshadowing do share that band's sorrowful outlook and their knack for brooding melodies. Metal comparisons, meanwhile, have included My Dying Bride, Paradise Lost, and Anathema. Quite a few of Italy's goth metal bands have had female lead singers with ethereal, angelic vocal styles (the Milan-based Lacuna Coil being the most famous), but the Foreshadowing have opted to employ a male frontman, Marco Benevento, instead.Exactly when the Foreshadowing got started is open to debate; one could trace their beginnings back to 1997, although the Foreshadowing didn't really become a full-fledged band (as opposed to merely an idea for a band) until the mid-2000s. It was in 1997 that guitarist Alessandro Pace, aka Alex Vega (b. May 20, 1977, Rome, Italy), decided to form a goth metal band, but the name the Foreshadowing came later. The Foreshadowing is not the only band that Pace has been a part of; he has also been with two other Rome-based groups, the alternative rock unit KLIMT 1918 and the industrial rock outfit Dope Stars, Inc., which he joined in 2005 and left in 2007. But the Foreshadowing is the band that has done the most to express Pace's goth side, and he had a very goth agenda when, around 1998, he recruited guitarist Andrea Chiodetti (who has played with the band Grimness and is an ex-member of a band called Spiritual Front) and keyboardist Francesco Sosto (another former member of Spiritual Front). But for a long time, the Foreshadowing remained in the planning stages and didn't do the type of things that real bands normally do (such as touring, dragging instruments or amps into clubs, or recording an album). The Foreshadowing finally started to feel like a real band in the mid-2000s, when Pace (or Vega), Chiodetti, and Sosto (who contributes backing vocals) were joined by drummer Jonah Padella (who has been with Grimness), bassist Davide Pesola (who has played alongside Pace in KLIMT 1918), and lead singer Marco Benevento, aka Dust (who has also been the lead vocalist for an Italian goth metal band called How Like a Winter). With that six-person lineup in place, the Foreshadowing recorded their debut album, Days of Nothing, in 2006; the album was released by Candlelight Records in both Europe and the United States in 2007. The gloomy and minimalist Oionos arrived in 2010 via Metal Blade, and in 2012 the band issued Second World, completing the apocalyptic trilogy. The following year saw the departure of drummer Padella, who was replaced by ex-Novembre drummer Giuseppe Orlando, and in 2016 the group released its much anticipated fourth full-length outing, Seven Heads, Ten Horns. ~ Alex Henderson, Rovi\"\n",

      "'Hailing from Finland are Entwine, a gothic metal quintet specializing in a darkly melodic and richly textured form of heavy pop music. The group began as a three-piece death metal outfit in the spring of 1995; that early lineup, consisting of Aki Hanttu (drums), Tom Mikkola (guitar and vocals), and T. Taipale (bass), gradually began incorporating more melodic and textural dimensions to their music, moving further away from death metal and into more conventional pop territory. After a few lineup changes, which included the addition of a second guitarist, P. William, Entwine produced its first demo tape, the four-song Divine Infinity, in 1997. By the time keyboardist Riita Heikkonen joined the band\\'s ranks in 1998, Divine Infinity\\'s atmospheric metal had earned the group a buzz of interest in the underground press, not to mention a growing horde of fans. Entwine\\'s first proper full-length album, The Treasures Within Hearts, was released to continued acclaim in September of 1999, although the group\\'s lineup was still in a state of flux. Willman and Taipale split in April 2000, the latter being replaced by Joni Meittinen. A new lead singer, Mika Tauriainen, entered the picture in May of 2000 and gave the band its most commercial appeal thus far. With a warm yet occasionally edgy singing style strongly reminiscent of Alice in Chains\\' Layne Staley, Tauriainen\\'s voice was the perfect fit for Entwine\\'s increasingly melodic and pop-based goth metal. The retooled Entwine entered Astia A-Studio late in 2000 (following three months\\' worth of rehearsal and woodshedding) and, with producer Anssi Kippo (Children of Bodom, Sinergy) at the controls, recorded the full-length Gone. Century Media released the record in 2001 and it quickly found a place in the Finnish pop charts, settling at number 25 while the single \"New Dawn\" raced to number ten on the singles chart. They went back to the same studios soon after and jumped back into the writing process. The end result, Time of Despair, was a far more alternative sounding record that shaved away many of their gloomier tendencies in exchange for simpler songwriting and more direct melodies. ~ Andy Hinds, Rovi'\n",

With their cult-albums “Vinland Saga” (2005) and “King of Kings” (2015) they already turned Leif Erikssons discovery of America and the life of Norway's first king into music. Now, LEAVES' EYES bring the Viking Sagas to their bombastic finale. LEAVES' EYES have always played in a league of their own. They have toured all populated continents, frequently reach top positions in the album charts and with every output they deliver a multimedia masterpiece when it comes to video clips and artwork. Of course, “The Last Viking” won't be the closure of LEAVES' EYES – it only fuels expectations what these geniuses will come up next with. With “The Last Viking” Leaves' Eyes set up their own musical monument that is just as captivating and strong as the saga of the last Viking King itself.\"\n",

      "\"As iconic groove metal leaders DEVILDRIVER enter their third decade with 9 full-length albums, countless international tours and worldwide renown, they prove more resilient than ever. As the world was upended in 2020, DEVILDRIVER didn't pause, releasing the highly-acclaimed first installment of their two-part Dealing With Demons saga, Dealing With Demons I. Media mainstays like Revolver, Metal Hammer, Kerrang and Consequence lauded the album, which debuted at #4 on the US Current Hard Music Albums Chart. Blabbermouth stated, “If the second half of this mammoth endeavor matches the first, this will be remembered as a pivotal moment in the DEVILDRIVER story.” As society emerges more hardened and determined than before, so does DEVILDRIVER's 10th full-length, Dealing With Demons Vol. II.Produced and engineered by Steve Evetts with additional engineering from guitarist Mike Spreitzer, Dealing With Demons Vol. II is inarguably heavier and relentlessly harsher than its predecessor. Dealing With Demons Vol. II represents not only the most vicious of the two records, but also the darkest recesses of iconic frontman Dez Fafara's psyche and the final purging of his demons that have long haunted the band's music, bringing together the elements that make DEVILDRIVER the best at their craft. If there is any question as to whether DEVILDRIVER is slowing down, the new album proves that 20 years into their career, even with their demons in tow – they move forward at the forefront of metal.\"\n",

      "'Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul started forming up Damageplan in early 2003, soon after the demise of their previous band, thrash metal heroes Pantera. The brothers began working on tracks at Dime\\'s Dallas home studio, unsure of exactly what they\\'d do with the material, but determined to banish the bad taste of Pantera\\'s awkward breakup. Ex-Halford and Diesel Machine guitarist (and full-time Dime pal) Pat Lachman heard the demos and expressed interest in singing for the project. While he\\'d never served as a frontman, Lachman\\'s performances over the raw material were strong enough to land him the vocalist position. The lineup was completed with the addition of local bassist Bob Kakaha, who was immediately dubbed Bob Zilla for his monstrous tone, and the quartet began hashing out the new material under the working title of New Found Power. By October 2003 they\\'d decided on Damageplan, with New Found Power becoming the name of their Elektra debut. The album dropped in February 2004 to considerable buzz, mostly from Pantera\\'s existing fan base. Longtime fans weren\\'t disappointed as New Found Power did echo Dime and Vinnie\\'s previous work. But it moved in new directions too, exploring more melodic post-grunge avenues and tinging its sound with slight elements of nu-metal\\'s electronic throb. New Found Power did well through the summer, buoyed by a solid round of dates from the band. But tragedy struck on December 8, 2004 at the Alrosa Village rock club in Columbus, Ohio, when Dimebag Darrell and three other men were murdered in a bizarre and unfortunate altercation with a disgruntled fan. A man appeared on-stage with a gun just after the beginning of Damageplan\\'s set and, after allegedly making comments laying blame for Pantera\\'s breakup on Dimebag, shot and killed the guitarist at point-blank range. The assailant killed three other men -- including a concertgoer, club employee, and Damageplan bodyguard Jeff \"Mayhem\" Thompson -- before he was killed by local police. After memorials and a period of grieving, the surviving members of Damageplan decided to disband the group, with Vinnie Paul and Bob Zilla forming Hellyeah and Pat Lachman forming a band named the Mercy Clinic. The former group did not garner a recording contract but Hellyeah released five albums between 2007 and 2016; the band was in Las Vegas recording a sixth album in June 2018 when Vinnie Paul died at the age of 54. ~ Johnny Loftus, Rovi'\n",

Formed in the mid-'90s when Pantera were on a brief break (between their Far Beyond Driven and The Great Southern Trendkill releases), the quartet's members had been longtime friends and decided to break up their downtime (hence their name).The EastWest label issued Down's 1995 debut, NOLA, an abbreviation for New Orleans, where all the group's original members came from. While many assumed that the band would specialize in over the top, extreme metal, it contained more elements of classic rock than the members' usual bands (a prime influence of the group being Black Sabbath). The album eventually went platinum in America, but after a supporting tour wrapped up, little was heard from the group; the members had returned to their full-time projects, leading many to assume that Down were a one-off. But Anselmo, Keenan, and Bower reconvened to work on new material in 2001, with Pantera bassist Rex Brown taking Strange's spot in the lineup. March 2002 saw the release of Down's long-awaited sophomore effort, Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow.

      "'An integral part of the early-\\'80s thrash metal movement that spawned acts like Metallica and Anthrax, New Jersey\\'s Overkill garnered a reputation for brutal, pounding speed and technique. Emerging in 1985 with the punishing Feel the Fire, the band built up a strong following in the metal underground with subsequent outings like Under the Influence (1988) and Years of Decay (1989). Despite enduring myriad label and lineup changes -- bassist D. D. Verni and lead vocalist Bobby \"Blitz\" Ellsworth have been the group\\'s sole constant members -- Overkill have remained one of the East Coast\\'s most successful and versatile metal outfits, dabbling in doom, industrial, and stoner metal, while releasing an abundance of critically acclaimed albums like White Devil Armory (2014), The Wings of War (2019), and Scorched (2023). Taking their moniker from the 1979 Motörhead album of the same name, Overkill went through numerous personnel changes -- and spent some time playing sped-up punk covers under the name Virgin Killer -- before settling on a lineup consisting of Bobby \"Blitz\" Ellsworth (vocals), Bobby Gustafson (guitar), Rat Skates (drums), and D. D. Verni (bass). An early demo, Power in Black, made waves in the underground tape-trading circuit, which was starting to catch fire as West Coast thrash artists like Testament and Exodus began gaining some traction. The demo caught the attention of Megaforce Records, which issued the band\\'s full-length studio debut, Feel the Fire, in 1985. High-profile shows alongside luminaries like Slayer and Anthrax followed, and with the American thrash scene in full tilt, Overkill inked a major-label deal with Atlantic, which put out their sophomore effort, 1987\\'s uncompromising Taking Over. That year also saw the departure of Skates, who was replaced by Bob \"Sid\" Falck, formerly of Paul Di\\'Anno\\'s Battlezone. Falck made his studio debut on 1988\\'s Under the Influence, which marked the group\\'s highest-charting LP to date. Continuing their breakneck pace, the band issued the Terry Date-produced Years of Decay the following year, which saw them pushing their sound in a more epic direction, while maintaining the neck-snapping attack of their debut. A dispute over royalties and the group\\'s general direction led to the departure of Gustafson in 1990, making way for two new guitarists, Rob Cannavino and Merritt Gant, the latter of whom previously served as Gustafson\\'s guitar tech. The newly minted quintet issued their fifth studio long-player, the brooding and relentlessly heavy Horrorscope, the following year, which introduced elements of doom into the mix and would go on to become a defining release and fan favorite. Overkill continued to move toward a more Sabbathy stoner rock style on 1993\\'s I Hear Black, which saw M.O.D. drummer Tim Mallare taking over drum duties from Falck, who left to explore other musical avenues. The album was divisive, with some fans bemoaning the group\\'s new direction, but it also arrived in the midst of a huge shakeup in the mainstream, with grunge putting heavy metal on the backburner. 1994\\'s W.F.O. marked a return to the whiplash-inducing thrash of the past, but it would be the last outing for guitarists Cannavino and Grant, as well as the last Overkill release for Atlantic Records. More than happy to leave the major label, which had long since turned its attention elsewhere, the group signed with CMC International, an independent destination that served as a safe haven for hard rock and heavy metal groups during the alternative rock and grunge boom of the \\'90s. With a new guitar team of Joe Comeau and Sebastian Marino, Overkill spent the remainder of the decade issuing a string of high-octane and generally well-received releases, including The Killing Kind (1996), From the Underground and Below (1997), Necroshine (1999), and the all-covers LP Coverkill (1999), the latter of which saw the group paying homage to influences like Black Sabbath, Kiss, Motörhead, Manowar, and even the Ramones. In early 2000 Comeau left the fold to join Annihilator, and the band decided to soldier on as a four-piece, releasing their 11th full-length outing, Bloodletting, later that October. While on tour for the album, Ellsworth collapsed on-stage in Germany after suffering a mild stroke. It would prove to be a minor setback, however, as the band inked a deal with New York-based indie Spitfire Records and continued not only to put out albums, but to tour vigorously in support of 2003\\'s Killbox 13, 2005\\'s ReliXIV, and 2007\\'s Immortalis, the latter of which was issued on Bodog Records. In 2010, Overkill experienced a new resurgence with the release of Ironbound. Their first outing for Nuclear Blast, the album was the band\\'s first release to chart on the Billboard 200 in 17 years, with some critics citing it as a \"thrash-terpiece\". They followed up with another album of classic thrash in 2012 with The Electric Age, which performed even better. Ellsworth suffered another health-related setback the following year and had to cancel some tour dates after contracting mild pneumonia. He soon bounced back, however, and, riding their new wave of success, the group plunged back into the studio to record 2014\\'s White Devil Armory, which would become their highest-charting LP to date. The following year saw the arrival of the mid-career retrospective Historikill: 1995–2007, and in 2018 they released their 18th studio album, Grinding Wheel. 2018\\'s Live in Overhausen captured an April 2016 concert in Oberhausen, Germany during which the band celebrated the 30th anniversary of their debut, Feel the Fire, and the 25th anniversary of career standout Horrorscope. 2019\\'s Wings of War introduced new drummer Jason Bittner (Shadows Fall), and garnered acclaim both at home and abroad. 2023\\'s hard-hitting Scorched, which was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, marked the longest period between albums for the group. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "\"There have been few vocalists in the history of heavy metal whose singing style has been as influential and instantly recognizable as Rob Halford's. Able to effortlessly alternate between a throaty growl and an ear-splitting falsetto, he became iconic in the '70s and '80s as the frontman for British hard rock rebels Judas Priest. In the late '90s Halford also found icon status in the LGBTQ community as one of the most visible openly gay metal heads after coming out publicly in 1998. Halford's signature howls were the calling card of classic Priest albums like 1980's British Steel and 1982's Screaming for Vengeance, as well as a handful of side projects that materialized over the years.Born on August 25, 1951, in Birmingham, England, Halford began singing as a teenager, fronting a local rock band, Hiroshima, and working as a theatrical lighting engineer. But a freak occurrence landed Halford the frontman spot with an up-and-coming rock band out of Birmingham, Judas Priest. In 1973, Halford's sister was dating Priest bassist Ian Hill, and one day a few members were over at the Halford's house when they overheard Halford singing along to the radio. Priest had just lost a singer, so a tryout was set up and Halford was promptly accepted into Priest, joining Hill, the twin guitar team of K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, and a revolving door of drummers. With Halford on board, Priest's sound shifted in a more metallic direction, and by 1974, their first album was issued on the small Gull label, Rocka Rolla. Although the debut was an unfocused affair that quickly sank from sight, with each successive release, Judas Priest focused their sound and songwriting, leading to a string of certifiable metal classics that broadened their worldwide fan base: 1976's Sad Wings of Destiny, 1977's Sin After Sin (the band's first for Columbia Records), 1978's Stained Class, plus 1979's Hell Bent for Leather and Unleashed in the East (these albums in particular would inspire countless future metal bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Slayer, Def Leppard, Megadeth, Pantera, etc.). During this time, Halford's look was that of a biker; dressed head to toe in leather and studs, he would even drive a Harley on-stage at each show. Judas Priest had built up a loyal cult following during the '70s, but by the dawn of the '80s, the quintet sought to broaden their sound to obtain mainstream success. The ploy worked, with such gold- and platinum-selling hits as 1980's British Steel, 1981's Point of Entry, 1982's Screaming for Vengeance, and 1984's Defenders of the Faith, making Priest one of the world's top metal bands and an arena headliner. Further sold-out tours and albums of varying quality followed (1986's Turbo, 1987's Priest Live, 1988's Ram It Down, and 1990's over-the-top metalfest Painkiller), but by 1992, Halford announced he was leaving the group after nearly 20 years of service.Although the reason given for Halford's abrupt departure was his need to explore other musical styles, his first non-Priest project was Fight, a quintet that was a carbon copy of Painkiller-era Priest. After a total of two albums (1994's War of Words and 1995's Small Deadly Space) and an EP (1994's Mutations), Halford ended the band. His next project would be a more industrial-sounding outfit called Two. Undoubtedly inspired by Nine Inch Nails (the band was even signed to NIN leader Trent Reznor's label, Nothing Records), Two issued a lone album in 1997 titled Voyeurs. Just prior to the album's release, Halford addressed long-standing rumors concerning his sexuality by stating publicly for the first time in his career that he was gay. With his electro-rock experiment out of his system, the former Priest singer returned to his metal roots with another quintet simply called Halford. 2000's Resurrection was greeted favorably by metalheads everywhere, and an opening stint on Iron Maiden's Brave New World tour heightened interest. Halford's first post-Priest live set followed a year later with the double-disc Live Insurrection, while rumors continued to persist concerning a Halford/Priest reunion (both camps have supposedly patched up their differences). In 2002, another Halford release was issued, Crucible, before the announcement that many a metalhead had been clamoring for was made public: Halford and Priest got back together, resulting in the release of such subsequent albums as 2005's Angel of Retribution and 2008's Nostradamus, and world tours. Halford continued his solo work with the occasional compilation or album, releasing Halford III: Winter Songs in 2009 and Halford IV: Made of Metal the next year. Priest's 17th studio album, Redeemer of Souls, was released in 2014 and the band reunited with producer Tom Allom for 2018's heavy-hitting Firepower. Halford took an unexpected turn the next year with the release of Celestial, a heavy metal holiday album with decidedly hard rock takes on traditional Christmas carols and seasonal tunes. ~ Greg Prato, Rovi\"\n",

Lombardo was idolized by fans and musicians in awe of the power, speed, and control he exhibited on the drum kit while with Slayer, and the more dynamic but still quite heavy music of Grip Inc. only enhanced the drummer's reputation as a true metal virtuoso. While Grip Inc. is clearly led by Lombardo, the group's records are much more than the percussion exercises some listeners might expect. Vocalist Gus Chambers and guitarist/producer Waldemar Sorychta each play essential roles in the band's creative process and manage never to get overrun on record by Lombardo's unstoppable, massive drumming. The group debuted in 1995 on Metal Blade Records with the release Power of Inner Strength. The most relentless collection of their career, this first offering displayed Lombardo's musical depth and commitment to power, while his bandmate's (including bassist Jason Viebrooks) deftly rode Lombardo's rhythmic wave like surfers gliding over gushing molten rock. Grip Inc. followed up Power of Inner Strength with Nemesis in 1997. This follow-up definitely followed the formula established two years earlier, but with some added progressive flavor and a few quieter moments. In 1999, bassist Stuart Caruthers replaced Viebrooks and Solidify was released featuring the updated lineup. Aptly titled, the group's third disc is perhaps their most accomplished and ambitious work. Solidify certainly furthered Grip Inc.'s trend toward more progressive and exotic rhythms, structures, and instrumentations, while never compromising intensity. Sorychta's producing efforts on each of the three recordings deserves special mention. The guitarist's blistering riffs are equaled if not eclipsed by his impressive tones and mixes that have a strengthening affect on the group's aggressive metal. With their commitment to musical growth and a great instinct for pure heaviness, Grip Inc. are one of metal's best late-'90s musical treats. ~ Vincent Jeffries, Rovi\"\n",

The band's eponymous fourth album was released in January 1998, followed shortly afterwards by Act of God in 1999 and Round Six in 2000.

      "\"The leaders of Holland's death metal scene, Gorefest built a substantial underground following over the course of the '90s with a powerful, groove-based sound that often paralleled similar innovations by bands like Entombed and Sepultura. Founded by vocalist/bassist Jan-Chris De Koeyer and guitarist Frank Harthoorn in 1989, Gorefest issued their debut album Mindloss in 1991, with a drummer and second guitarist known only as Mark and Alex, respectively. Dissatisfied with the band's level of musicianship, De Koeyer and Harthoorn jettisoned the two and hired on drummer Ed Warby and guitarist Boudewijn Bonebakker. The move paid immediate dividends; signing to Nuclear Blast in 1992, the band issued False, not only a more consistent and technically accomplished record, but also a much more original one. While False slipped through the cracks in some death metal quarters, enough underground aficionados heaped praise on the record to build Gorefest's cult following. Next up was the live album The Eindhoven Insanity, recorded at the Dynamo metal festival in Holland; the proper follow-up, Erase, was released in 1994 and found the band moving subtly toward more traditional forms of metal, partly through its sure sense of groove. That approach crystallized on 1996's Soul Survivor, which combined death metal with the elegant power and accessibility of '70s British metal. With that, Gorefest's association with Nuclear Blast ended, and the band wound up on the German imprint Steamhammer/SPV. Chapter 13 was issued in Europe in 1998, and it continued Gorefest's interest in classic rock; however, just before the end of the year, the band announced its breakup. Chapter 13 was finally released in the U.S. in 2000. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi\"\n",

Although both of the bandmembers' full-time bands specialized in extreme metal sounds, Nailbomb somehow found a way to create even more dense and harsh metallic sounds (it also proves to be more repetitive, with the odd sample and drum machine detected here and there). In addition to the duo, most of Cavalera's then-bandmates from Sepultura (guitarist Andreas Kisser and drummer Igor Cavalera) and Fear Factory guitarist Dino Cazares made special guest appearances on Nailbomb's debut recording for Roadrunner Records, 1994's Point Blank, while the group's final release, 1995's Proud to Commit Commercial Suicide, featured appearances from former Dead Kennedys drummer D.H.

      "'Nevermore straddles the line between power metal, traditional heavy metal, and the contemporary hard rock scene, eschewing the silly theatrics of the \"power scene\" in favor of a darker tone, while reaping the rewards of melody and the high-flying vocal range of singer Warrel Dane. The roots of the Seattle-based band can be traced back to Sanctuary, with whom Nevermore\\'s Dane and bassist Jim Sheppard recorded two albums. Sanctuary was one of a small handful of late-\\'80s thrash metal bands to sign with a major label; they even enlisted Megadeth leader Dave Mustaine to produce their debut album. Label-imposed limbo caused the band to grind to a halt, with one member also exiting to pursue more \"grunge\"-oriented music. Three members of the final lineup of Sanctuary reemerged as Nevermore, inking a worldwide deal with Century Media Records and releasing a punishing eponymous debut album in 1995. The following year saw the band issue a well-received EP, In Memory, that boasted cover tunes as well as Sanctuary material, which pleased many fans. The Politics of Ecstasy, their second proper album, was a dense, technical masterpiece that displayed the talents of guitarists Pat O\\'Brian and Jeff Loomis, and drummer Van Williams in particular. But it was with their next opus, the dark and conceptually driven Dreaming Neon Black, that Nevermore really caught the attention of heavy music fans and earned the respect of the heavy metal press. Voted Album of the Year by many publications, 1999\\'s Dreaming Neon Black was a tour de force that highlighted Dane\\'s soaring vocal range. It also included newcomer (and former guitarist for Forbidden) Tim Calvert, who replaced O\\'Brian when he split to join Cannibal Corpse. After successful tours with Iced Earth and Mercyful Fate, the band knew that they had a tough job ahead of them following up the well-received album. Now a four-piece after the exit of Calvert, Nevermore entered a Texas studio with producer Andy Sneap and crafted a new album that adeptly blended contemporary heavy sounds with traditional heavy metal. Dead Heart in a Dead World was released in 2000, and was supported on the road with a full U.S. tour with Swedish metal band In Flames and labelmates Shadows Fall. ~ Ryan J. Downey, Rovi'\n",

      "'Dire Straits emerged during the post-punk era of the late \\'70s, and while their sound was minimalistic and stripped down, they owed little to punk. If anything, the band was a direct outgrowth of the roots revivalism of pub rock, but where pub rock celebrated good times, Dire Straits were melancholy. Led by guitarist/vocalist Mark Knopfler, the group built their sound upon the laid-back blues-rock of J.J. Cale, but they also had jazz and country inflections, occasionally dipping into the epic song structures of progressive rock. The band\\'s music was offset by Knopfler\\'s lyrics, which approximated the winding, stream-of-conscious narratives of Bob Dylan. As their career progressed, Dire Straits became more refined and their new maturity happened to coincide with the rise of MTV and the compact disc. These two musical revolutions from the mid-\\'80s helped make Dire Straits\\' sixth album, Brothers in Arms, an international blockbuster. The band -- along with Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, and Steve Winwood -- become one of the leaders of a group of self-consciously mature veteran rock &amp; rollers in the late \\'80s that designed their music to appeal to aging baby boomers. Despite the band\\'s international success, they couldn\\'t sustain their stardom, waiting a full six years to deliver a follow-up to Brothers in Arms, by which time their audience had shrunk significantly. Knopfler (born August 12, 1949) was always the main force behind Dire Straits. The son of an architect, Knopfler studied English literature at Leeds University and worked briefly as a rock critic for the Yorkshire Evening Post while at college. He began teaching English after his graduation, leading a pub rock band called Brewer\\'s Droop at night. By 1977, Mark was playing with his brother David (guitar) and his roommate John Illsley (bass). During the summer of 1977, the trio cut a demo with drummer Pick Withers. A London DJ named Charlie Gillett heard the demo and began playing \"Sultans of Swing\" on his BBC show Honky Tonkin\\'. Following a tour opening for Talking Heads, the band began recording their debut for Vertigo Records with producer Muff Winwood in early 1978. By the summer, they had signed with Warner in America, releasing their eponymous debut in the fall. Thanks to the Top Ten hit \"Sultans of Swing,\" Dire Straits was a major success in both Britain and America, with the single and album climbing into the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic.Dire Straits established Dire Straits as a major force on album-oriented radio in America, and their second album, Communique (1979), consolidated their audience, selling three million copies worldwide. As the group was recording its third album, David Knopfler left the band to pursue a solo career; he was replaced by former Darling member Hal Lindes. Like its predecessor, Making Movies was a sizable hit in America and Britain, even though the band was criticized for musically treading water. Nevertheless, the record went gold on the strength of the radio and MTV hits \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Skateaway.\" Dire Straits followed the album two years later with Love Over Gold, an album filled with long, experimental passages, plus the single \"Private Investigations,\" which became a number two hit in the U.K. The album went gold in America and spent four weeks at number one in Britain. Shortly after the release of Love Over Gold, former Rockpile drummer Terry Williams replaced Withers.During 1982, Knopfler began exploring musical avenues outside of Dire Straits, scoring the Bill Forsyth film Local Hero and playing on Van Morrison\\'s Beautiful Vision. Apart from releasing the Twisting by the Pool EP early in 1983, Dire Straits were quiet for the majority of 1983 and 1984, as Knopfler produced Bob Dylan\\'s Infidels, as well as Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille; he also wrote \"Private Dancer for Tina Turner\\'s comeback album. In the spring of 1984, the band released the double album Alchemy: Dire Straits Live and by the end of the year, they had begun recording their fifth studio album with their new keyboardist, Guy Fletcher.Released in the summer of 1985, Brothers in Arms was Dire Straits\\' breakthrough album, making the band international stars. Supported by the groundbreaking computer-animated video for \"Money for Nothing,\" a song which mocked music videos, the album became a blockbuster, spending nine weeks at the top of the American charts and selling over nine million copies; in England, the album became the biggest-selling album of the \\'80s. \"Walk of Life\" and \"So Far Away\" kept Brothers in Arms in the charts through 1986, and Dire Straits played over 200 dates in support of the album. Once the tour was completed, Dire Straits went on hiatus for several years, as Knopfler produced records by Randy Newman and Joan Armatrading, scored films, toured with Eric Clapton, and recorded a duet album with Chet Atkins (Neck and Neck, 1990). In 1989, he formed the country-rock group Notting Hillbillies, whose sole album, Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time, became a British hit upon its spring 1990 release. During the extended time off, John Illsley recorded his second album; the first appeared in 1984.In 1990, Knopfler reconvened Dire Straits, which now featured Illsley, Clark, Fletcher, and various session musicians. The band released On Every Street in the fall of 1991 to great anticipation. However, the album failed to meet expectations -- it only went platinum in America and it didn\\'t crack the U.K. Top 40 -- and failed to generate a hit single. Similarly, the tour was a disappointment, with many tickets going unsold in both the U.S. and Europe. Once the tour was completed, the live album On the Night was released in the spring of 1993 and the band again went on hiatus. In 1996, Knopfler launched his solo career with Golden Heart. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

During their short time together as a band (1968 – 1972), the band enjoyed an unparalleled period of creativity. They've sold over 30 million records in the U.S. alone, releasing 14 Top 10 hits, six Platinum albums (two of which went to number one) and one Gold album. They also managed to play over 150 tour dates around the world, including a headlining spot at Woodstock.Creedence Clearwater Revival's canon has become a part of the Great American Songbook.

      "'Nothing was ever quite the same after Nirvana. The band\\'s second album, 1991\\'s Nevermind, revolutionized popular music by bringing alternative rock above ground, introducing mainstream audiences to sounds and concepts that had previously existed only in shadowy record store corners and on low-frequency college radio airwaves. Nevermind\\'s noisy, dissonant guitar rock, mumbled or howled surrealistic lyrics, and generally angsty punk attitudes were unlikely candidates for chart success, but the band undercut their grungy songs with enough pop melodicism to create a sound unlike anything average listeners had ever heard before, striking at the exact right moment to become an unprecedented success. Since Nirvana were rooted in an indie aesthetic but loved pop music, they fought their stardom while courting it, becoming some of the most notorious anti-rock stars in history. They consciously attempted to shed their audience with abrasive, Steve Albini-produced third album In Utero, but by that point, the fate of the band and vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Kurt Cobain had been sealed. Suffering from drug addiction and manic depression, Cobain had become destructive and suicidal, though his management and label were able to hide the extent of his problems from the public until April 8, 1994, when he was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Cobain\\'s death cut Nirvana\\'s story tragically short, but their legacy stands as one of the most influential in rock &amp; roll history. Kurt Cobain (vocals, guitar) met Chris Novoselic (born Krist Novoselic) (bass) in 1985 in Aberdeen, Washington, a small logging town 100 miles away from Seattle. While Novoselic came from a relatively stable background, Cobain\\'s childhood had been thrown into turmoil when his parents divorced when he was eight. Following the divorce, he lived at the homes of various relatives, developing a love for the Beatles and then heavy metal in the process. Eventually, American hardcore punk worked its way into dominating his listening habits and he met the Melvins, an Olympia-based underground heavy punk band. Cobain began playing in punk bands like Fecal Matter, often with the Melvins\\' bassist Dale Crover. Through the Melvins\\' leader, Buzz Osborne, Cobain met Novoselic, who also had an intense interest in punk, which meant that he, like Cobain, felt alienated from the macho, redneck population of Aberdeen. The duo decided to form a band called the Stiff Woodies, with Cobain on drums, Novoselic on bass, and a rotating cast of guitarists and vocalists. The group went through name changes as quickly as guitarists, before deciding that Cobain would play guitar and sing. Renamed Skid Row, the new trio featured drummer Aaron Burkhart, who left the band by the end of 1986 and was replaced by Chad Channing. By 1987, the band was called Nirvana. Nirvana began playing parties in Olympia, gaining a cult following. Around 1987, the band made ten demos with producer Jack Endino, who played the recordings to Jonathan Poneman, one of the founders of the Seattle-based indie label Sub Pop. Poneman signed Nirvana, and in December of 1988, the band released its first single, a cover of Shocking Blue\\'s \"Love Buzz.\" Sub Pop orchestrated an effective marketing scheme, which painted the band as backwoods, logging-town hicks, which irritated Cobain and Novoselic. While \"Love Buzz\" was fairly well-received, the band\\'s debut album, Bleach, was what got the ball rolling. Recorded for just over $600 and released in the spring of 1989, Bleach slowly became a hit on college radio, due to the group\\'s consistent touring. Though Jason Everman was credited as a second guitarist on the sleeve of Bleach, he didn\\'t appear on the record; he only toured in support of the album before leaving the band at the end of the year to join Soundgarden and then Mindfunk. Bleach sold 35,000 copies and Nirvana became favorites of college radio, the British weekly music press, and Sonic Youth, Mudhoney, and Dinosaur Jr., which was enough to attract the attention of major labels. During the summer of 1990, Nirvana released \"Sliver\"/\"Dive,\" which was recorded with Mudhoney\\'s Dan Peters on drums and produced by Butch Vig. The band also made a six-song demo with Vig, which was shopped to major labels, who soon began competing to sign the group. In August, they hit the road with Sonic Youth\\'s Goo tour (including Crover on drums). By the end of the summer, Dave Grohl, formerly of the D.C.-based hardcore band Scream, had become Nirvana\\'s drummer and the band signed with DGC for $287,000. Nirvana recorded their second album with Vig, completing the record in June of 1991. Nevermind was released in September, supported by a quick American tour. While DGC was expecting a moderately successful release, in the neighborhood of 100,000 copies, Nevermind immediately became a smash hit, quickly selling out its initial shipment of 50,000 copies and creating a shortage across America. What helped the record become a success was \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" a blistering four-chord rocker that was accompanied by a video that shot into heavy MTV rotation. By the beginning of 1992, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" had climbed into the American Top Ten and Nevermind bumped Michael Jackson\\'s much-touted comeback album Dangerous off the top of the album charts; it reached the British Top Ten shortly afterward. By February, the album had been certified triple platinum. Nirvana\\'s success took the music industry by surprise, Nirvana included. From the moment Nirvana were met with mainstream visibility, Cobain used his newfound fame to relentlessly push his favorite independent artists as if their music was more important than his own. This took the form of bringing Japanese alt-pop trio Shonen Knife on tour, covering lesser-known but formative artists like the Wipers, the Vaselines, and Meat Puppets, or wearing a homemade Daniel Johnston t-shirt during television appearances and high-profile concerts. Cobain\\'s enthusiastic fandom introduced untold numbers of Nirvana fans to artists they most likely wouldn\\'t have known to seek out on their own, and in the process, energized those artists\\' careers.It soon become apparent that Nirvana wasn\\'t quite sure how to handle its success. Around the time of Nevermind\\'s release, the band was into baiting its audience -- Cobain appeared on MTV\\'s Headbangers Ball in drag, the group mocked the tradition of miming on the BBC\\'s Top of the Pops by Novoselic constantly throwing his bass into the air and Cobain singing his live vocals in the style of Ian Curtis, and their traditional live destruction of instruments was immortalized on a Saturday Night Live performance that ended with Novoselic and Grohl sharing a kiss -- but by the spring, questions had begun to arise about the band\\'s stability. Cobain married Courtney Love, the leader of the indie rock/foxcore band Hole, in February of 1992, announcing that the couple was expecting a child in the fall. Shortly after the marriage, rumors that Cobain and Love were heavy heroin users began to circulate and the strength of the rumors only increased when Nirvana canceled several summer concerts and refused to mount a full-scale American tour during the summer. Cobain complained that he was suffering from chronic stomach troubles, which seemed to be confirmed when he was admitted to a Belfast hospital after a June concert. But heroin rumors continued to surface, especially in the form of a late-summer Vanity Fair article implying that Love was using during her pregnancy. Both Love and Cobain denied the article\\'s allegations, and publicly harassed and threatened the article\\'s author. Love delivered Frances Bean Cobain, a healthy baby girl, on August 18, 1992, but the couple soon battled with Los Angeles\\' children\\'s services, who claimed they were unfit parents on the basis of the Vanity Fair article. The couple was granted custody of the child by the beginning of 1993. Since Cobain was going through such well-documented personal problems, Nirvana was unable to record a follow-up to Nevermind until the spring of 1993. In the meantime, DGC released the odds-and-ends compilation Incesticide late in 1992; the album reached number 39 U.S. and number 14 U.K. As Nirvana prepared to make their third album, they released \"Oh, the Guilt\" as a split single with the Jesus Lizard on Touch &amp; Go Records. Choosing Steve Albini (Pixies, the Breeders, Big Black, the Jesus Lizard) as their producer, they recorded their third album, In Utero, in two weeks during the spring of 1993. Following its completion, controversy began to surround Nirvana again. Cobain suffered a heroin overdose on May 2, but the event was hidden from the press. The following month, Love called police to their Seattle home after Cobain locked himself in the bathroom, threatening suicide. Prior to debuting In Utero material during the New Music Seminar at New York\\'s Roseland Ballroom in July, Cobain had another covered-up overdose. By that time, reports began to circulate, including an article in Newsweek, that DGC was unhappy with the forthcoming album, and making accusations that the band deliberately made an uncommercial record. Both the band and the label denied such allegations. Deciding that Albini\\'s production was too flat, Nirvana decided to remaster the album with R.E.M.\\'s producer, Scott Litt. In Utero was released in September of 1993 to positive reviews and strong initial sales, debuting at the top of the U.S. and U.K. charts. Nirvana supported it with a fall American tour, hiring former Germs member Pat Smear as an auxiliary guitarist. While the album and the tour were both successful, sales weren\\'t quite as strong as expected, with several shows not selling out until the week of the concert. As a result, the group agreed to play MTV\\'s acoustic Unplugged show at the end of the year, and sales of In Utero picked up after its December airing. After wrapping up the U.S. tour on January 8, 1994 with a show at Center Arena in Seattle, Nirvana embarked on a European tour in February. Following a concert in Munich on February 29, Cobain stayed in Rome to vacation with Love. On March 4, she awakened to find that Cobain had attempted suicide by overdosing on the tranquilizer Rohypnol and drinking champagne. While the attempt was initially reported as an accidental overdose, it was well-known within the Nirvana camp that the vocalist had left behind a suicide note. Cobain returned to Seattle within a week of his hospitalization and his mental illness began to grow. On March 18, the police had to again talk the singer out of suicide after he locked himself in a room threatening to kill himself. Love and Nirvana\\'s management organized an intervention program that resulted in Cobain\\'s admission to the Exodus Recovery Center in L.A. on March 30, but he left the clinic on April 1, returning to Seattle. His mother filed a missing persons report on April 4. The following day, Cobain shot himself at his Seattle home. His body wasn\\'t discovered until April 8, when an electrician contracted to install an alarm system at the Cobain home stumbled upon the body. After his death, Kurt Cobain was quickly anointed as a spokesman for Generation X, as well as a symbol of its tortured angst. Novoselic and Grohl planned to release a double-disc live album at the end of 1994, but sorting through the tapes proved to be too painful, so MTV Unplugged in New York appeared in its place. The album debuted at the top of the British and American charts, as a home video comprised of live performances and interviews from the band\\'s Nevermind era, titled Live! Tonight! Sold Out!, was issued at the same time (the project began prior to Cobain\\'s passing and was completed by surviving bandmembers). In 1996, MTV Unplugged in New York\\'s electric counterpart, From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, was released, debuting at the top of the U.S. charts. Following Cobain\\'s death, Grohl formed the Foo Fighters (early rumors that Novoselic would also be a member of the band ultimately proved to be false), releasing their self-titled debut album in 1995, followed by The Colour and the Shape in 1997 and There Is Nothing Left to Lose in 1999. Novoselic formed the trio Sweet 75, releasing their debut in the spring of 1997, and also appeared along with former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra and former Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil on the 2000 live set Live from the Battle in Seattle under the name the No W.T.O. Combo.By the late \\'90s, Novoselic began research for a proposed box set of previously unreleased songs from throughout Nirvana\\'s career. The project was supposed to surface in the fall of 2001 (to coincide with the tenth anniversary release of Nevermind), but legal issues delayed its release. Finally, the Nirvana LLC partnership -- which included Grohl and Novoselic plus Courtney Love, who manages Cobain\\'s estate -- came to an agreement and the album-length compilation Nirvana was released in October of 2002. Although that release included only one unreleased song, the long-awaited box set, titled With the Lights Out, appeared in late 2004, including three discs of rare and unreleased material plus a live DVD that featured material filmed as early as 1988. The band\\'s 1992 set at the Reading Festival was released in 2009 as Live at Reading. The same year, Sub Pop began a Nirvana studio album reissue campaign with Bleach; special 20th-anniversary editions of Nevermind and In Utero followed in 2011 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, Nirvana was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame by R.E.M.\\'s Michael Stipe. Cobain\\'s place in the induction performance was taken by several vocalists, including Joan Jett and Kim Gordon. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Greg Prato, Rovi'\n",

      "'When Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, the band\\'s future was put into question. Within months rumors flew that Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell would replace de la Rocha. And gossip fueled truth, for Cornell joined the rest of Rage in the studio in May 2001. The mix was great and a musical bond was in the making: Cornell, Tim Commerford, Brad Wilk, and Tom Morello spent the next year writing and recording. By spring 2002, the foursome were no longer going by the Rage Against the Machine name and signed on for Ozzfest. But before the summer tour even got underway, Cornell quit the new project. He claimed it wasn\\'t moving forward in the direction he\\'d hoped for. The breakdown didn\\'t last, for Cornell rejoined by early fall. After tossing around the idea of being called Civilian, they settled on Audioslave. The single \"Cochise,\" named for the great American Indian chief who died free and unconquered, hit radio in September 2002, and Audioslave\\'s Epic full-length debut was released that November. The self-titled album eventually went multi-platinum on the strength of \"Cochise\" and the moody rocker \"Like a Stone,\" and Audioslave supported it with gigs that included 2003 Lollapalooza dates. Cornell, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford returned in May 2005 with Out of Exile, which debuted at number one on Billboard. That same month they played an historic show in Havana, Cuba, that marked that country\\'s first outdoor show by an American rock band (that fall releasing the whole shebang on the Live in Cuba DVD). Exile continued the band\\'s platinum-selling ways -- singles like \"Be Yourself\" and \"Doesn\\'t Remind Me\" went to the top of the charts -- and the guys wasted no time following up with album number three, Revelations, in early September 2006. Work on the album took only five weeks, since most of the songs had been fleshed out live over the previous year. In 2007, shortly after the members of Rage announced that they would reunite for that year\\'s Coachella festival, Cornell left Audioslave, citing both personal and musical differences. While on tour with Soundgarden in May 2017, Cornell was found dead in his Detroit hotel room following a show at the city\\'s Fox Theater; he had taken his own life at the age of 52. ~ MacKenzie Wilson, Rovi'\n",

      "\"A subsidiary of Universal, Republic Records signed the musicians and issued their major-label debut, The Better Life, in early 2000.The Better Life became one of the biggest-selling albums of 2000, going platinum four times during its first year of release and spawning several singles. The band furthered its success with 2002's Away from the Sun, which debuted at number eight on the Billboard Top 200 and, like its predecessor, climbed to multi-platinum status. 3 Doors Down toured steadily throughout 2003 and 2004 in support of Away from the Sun, and issued the live EP Another 700 Miles in November 2003 as a holdover between studio efforts. The group returned with a heavier album, Seventeen Days, in early 2005. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and went platinum in its first week of release. A self-titled album, which followed in May 2008, repeated its predecessor's success when it too debuted at the top of the Billboard 200.3 Doors Down toured throughout 2009, released a digital-only acoustic holiday album at the end of the year, and began to work on their next album in 2010. With Howard Benson serving as producer, the guys shuttled themselves between L.A. and Tokyo, recording the album in both cities and eventually emerging with 2011's Time of My Life.\"\n",

      "\"We went in search of ourselves as the band that we have somehow always been. Just for the fun of it we jammed and learned some old songs. Before long we started the mysterious process of building new songs. A beautiful bit of chemistry meddling that had befriended us hundreds of times along the way. Once we found that slip stream of sound and vision, we just kept mining. With time turned into an elastic waist band of oversized underwear, we had no reason to stop writing and rocking. It felt like a dream. When all was said and done, our moody love for each other and the magic of music had gifted us with more songs than we knew what to do with. Well we figured it out. 2 double albums released back to back. The second of which is easily as meaningful as the first or should that be reversed.

      "'Lynyrd Skynyrd is the definitive Southern rock band, fusing the overdriven power of blues-rock with a rebellious Southern image and a hard rock swagger. Skynyrd never relied on the jazzy improvisations of the Allman Brothers. Instead, they were a hard-living, hard-driving rock &amp; roll band. They may have jammed endlessly on-stage, but their music remained firmly entrenched in blues, rock, and country. Throughout the band\\'s early records, frontman Ronnie Van Zant demonstrated a knack for lyrical detail and a down-to-earth honesty that had more in common with country than rock &amp; roll. During the height of Skynyrd\\'s popularity in the mid-\\'70s, they adopted a more muscular and gritty blues-rock sound that yielded the classic rock standards \"Sweet Home Alabama,\" \"Simple Man,\" \"What\\'s Your Name,\" \"That Smell,\" \"Gimme Three Steps,\" and \"Free Bird.\" The group ceased operations after the tragic deaths of Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines, who were killed in an airplane crash on October 20, 1977. Skynyrd re-formed in 1987 with Ronnie\\'s younger sibling Johnny Van Zant on vocals, and guitarist and co-founder Gary Rossington, who would serve as the group\\'s sole constant member over the years. In 2018, after decades of performing and recording, the band embarked on a farewell tour, which was chronicled on the 2020 concert LP and film Last of the Street Survivors Tour Lyve!While in high school in Jacksonville, Florida, Ronnie Van Zant (vocals), Allen Collins (guitar), and Gary Rossington (guitar) formed My Backyard. Within a few months, the group added bassist Leon Wilkeson and keyboardist Billy Powell, and changed their name to Lynyrd Skynyrd, a mocking tribute to their gym teacher Leonard Skinner, who was notorious for punishing students with long hair. With drummer Bob Burns, Lynyrd Skynyrd began playing throughout the South. For the first few years, the group had little success, but producer Al Kooper signed the band to MCA after seeing them play at an Atlanta club called Funocchio\\'s in 1972. Kooper produced the group\\'s 1973 debut, Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd, which was recorded after former Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King joined the band. The group became notorious for their triple-guitar attack, which was showcased on \"Free Bird,\" a tribute to then-recently deceased Duane Allman. \"Free Bird\" earned Lynyrd Skynyrd their first national exposure and it became one of the staples of album rock radio, still receiving airplay decades after its release.\"Free Bird\" and an opening slot on the Who\\'s 1973 Quadrophenia tour gave Lynyrd Skynyrd a devoted following, which helped their second album, 1974\\'s Second Helping, become its breakthrough hit. Featuring the hit single \"Sweet Home Alabama\" -- a response to Neil Young\\'s \"Southern Man\" -- Second Helping reached number 12 and went multi-platinum. At the end of the year, Artimus Pyle replaced drummer Burns and King left the band shortly afterward. The new sextet released Nuthin\\' Fancy in 1975, and it became the band\\'s first Top Ten hit. The record was followed by the Tom Dowd-produced Gimme Back My Bullets in 1976, which failed to match the success of its two predecessors. However, the band retained their following through constant touring, which was documented on the double-live album One More from the Road. Released in late 1976, the album featured the band\\'s new guitarist, Steve Gaines, and a trio of female backup singers, and it became Skynyrd\\'s second Top Ten album.Lynyrd Skynyrd released their sixth album, Street Survivors, on October 17, 1977. Three days later, a privately chartered plane carrying the band between shows in Greenville, South Carolina and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, crashed outside of Gillsburg, Mississippi. Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and his sister Cassie, one of the group\\'s backing vocalists, died in the crash; the remaining members were injured. (The cause of the crash was either fuel shortage or a fault with the plane\\'s mechanics.) The cover for Street Survivors had pictured the band surrounded in flames; after the crash, the cover was changed. In the wake of the tragedy, the album became one of the band\\'s biggest hits. Lynyrd Skynyrd broke up after the crash, releasing a collection of early demos called Skynyrd\\'s First and...Last in 1978; it had been scheduled for release before the crash. The double-album compilation Gold &amp; Platinum was released in 1980.Later in 1980, Rossington and Collins formed a new band -- naturally named the Rossington Collins Band -- that featured four surviving members. Two years later, Pyle formed the Artimus Pyle Band. Collins suffered a car crash in 1986 that killed his girlfriend and left him paralyzed; four years later, he died of respiratory failure. In 1987, Rossington, Powell, King, and Wilkeson reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd, adding vocalist Johnny Van Zant and guitarist Randall Hall. The band embarked on a reunion tour, which was captured on the 1988 double-live album Southern by the Grace of God: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987. The re-formed Skynyrd began recording in 1991, and for the remainder of the decade, the band toured frequently, putting out albums occasionally. The reunited Skynyrd frequently switched drummers, but it had little effect on their sound. During the \\'90s, Lynyrd Skynyrd were made honorary colonels in the Alabama State Militia, due to their classic rock staple \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" During the mid-\\'90s, Van Zant, Rossington, Wilkeson, and Powell regrouped by adding two Southern rock veterans to Skynyrd\\'s guitar stable: former Blackfoot frontman Rickey Medlocke and ex-Outlaws Hughie Thomasson. With ex-Damn Yankee Michael Cartellone bringing stability to the drum chair, the reconstituted band signed to CMC International for the 1997 album Twenty. This lineup went on to release Lyve from Steel Town in 1998, followed a year later by Edge of Forever. The seasonal effort Christmas Time Again was released in fall 2000. Although Wilkeson died one year later, Lynyrd Skynyrd regrouped and recorded Vicious Cycle for a 2003 release. The concert film and LP Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour followed a year later, 2006 saw the release of Face to Face, and 2007 brought Paper Sleeve Box. But death continued to haunt the band, and the lineup continued to change, as much from attrition as anything else. Wilkeson, Skynyrd\\'s bassist since 1972, died in 2001 and was replaced by Ean Evans that same year (Evans, in turn, died in 2009). Thomasson left the band to re-form his band Outlaws in 2005, dying two years later in 2007. His spot in Skynyrd was taken by Mark \"Sparky\" Matejka, formerly of Hot Apple Pie, in 2006. Original keyboardist Powell died at the age of 56 at his home near Jacksonville, Florida in 2009. That year also saw the release of a new studio album, God + Guns, on Roadrunner Records. Live from Freedom Hall was released on the same label in 2010. A new studio album, Last of a Dyin\\' Breed, produced by Bob Marlette, recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, and featuring a new bass player, Johnny Colt (formerly a bassist for the Black Crowes), appeared in 2012. In April 2015, original Skynyrd drummer Bob Burns died in a single-car accident in Bartow County, Georgia. After battling lung cancer, guitarist Ed King died in Nashville, Tennessee in August 2018. That same year saw the group announce their farewell tour. Last of the Street Survivors Tour Lyve!, a concert album and film documenting the tour, was released in 2020. Despite this, Lynyrd Skynyrd opted to continue and in 2023 they announced they would be hitting the road with ZZ Top for \"The Sharp Dressed Simple Man Tour.\" On March 5, 2023, Gary Rossington, the last surviving original member of the band, died at the age of 71. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Steve Leggett, Rovi'\n",

      "'After ushering in the era of pop-metal with their 1986 blockbuster Slippery When Wet and its hit singles \"You Give Love a Bad Name,\" \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" and \"Living on a Prayer,\" Bon Jovi wound up transcending the big-haired \\'80s, withstanding changes in style and sound to become one of the biggest American rock bands of their time. Unlike a lot of their big-haired pop-metal peers, Bon Jovi\\'s appeal wasn\\'t limited to the States. Slippery When Wet, its 1988 sequel New Jersey, and 1992\\'s Keep the Faith were all international smashes, each selling over ten million copies worldwide. Another way they differed from other MTV favorites of the late \\'80s lies in how Bon Jovi cannily and subtly changed their sound to fit the time. First, the group slowly lessened their reliance on arena rock guitars, emphasizing melody and ballads without rejecting hard rock. They incorporated elements of soft rock and country, moves that helped the band sustain their popularity into the 21st century. Bon Jovi took their name from lead singer Jon Bon Jovi (born Jon Bongiovi), who spent his adolescence playing in local Jersey bands with David Bryan (born David Rashbaum). Jon\\'s cousin Tony Bongiovi owned the celebrated New York recording studio the Power Station and Jon spent many hours there, working as a janitor and recording demos after hours, sometimes supported by members of the E Street Band or Aldo Nova. One of those demos, \"Runaway,\" became a hit on local New Jersey radio and led to the formation of Bon Jovi the band: Jon and Bryan were supported by guitarist Dave Sabo, bassist Alec John Such, and drummer Tico Torres. \"Runaway\" spurred a major-label bidding war, leading to a contract with Polygram/Mercury in 1983. Before the group entered the studio, though, Bon Jovi replaced Sabo with Richie Sambora, a working guitarist with a long résumé, including a stint as a member of Message.Bon Jovi released their eponymous debut album in 1984, generating a Top 40 hit with the original version of \"Runaway.\" The following year, 7800° Fahrenheit was released and went gold, all serving as a prelude to the band\\'s 1986 breakthrough, Slippery When Wet. Paul Stanley had given Jon and Richie the phone number of professional songwriter Desmond Child, and together they wrote two of the album\\'s biggest hits in Richie\\'s parents\\' basement. The trio composed 30 songs in total and auditioned them for local New Jersey and New York teenagers, basing the album\\'s running order on their opinions. Supported by several appealing, straightforward videos that received heavy rotation on MTV, the record took off on the strength of \"You Give Love a Bad Name,\" followed quickly by \"Livin\\' on a Prayer\" and \"Wanted Dead or Alive.\" Those three Top Ten Hits helped propel Slippery When Wet to sales of nine million in the U.S. alone, establishing Bon Jovi as superstars in their home country. Their fame was not limited to the U.S., though, as the album also turned into a significant hit in Europe, Canada, Japan, and Australia.Bon Jovi built upon Slippery When Wet\\'s formula with 1988\\'s New Jersey, which shot to number one upon its release. New Jersey was only slightly less successful than its predecessor, selling five-million copies and generating two number one singles, \"Bad Medicine\" and \"I\\'ll Be There for You,\" as well as the Top Ten hits \"Born to Be My Baby,\" \"Lay Your Hands on Me,\" and \"Living in Sin.\" Following the completion of an 18-month international tour, the band went on hiatus. During the time off, Jon Bon Jovi wrote the soundtrack for Young Guns II, which was released in 1990 as the Blaze of Glory album. The record produced two hit singles -- the number one title track and the number 12 \"Miracle\" -- and earned several Grammy and Oscar nominations. The following year, Bon Jovi reunited to record their fifth album, Keep the Faith, which was released in the fall of 1992. While the album didn\\'t match the blockbuster status of its predecessors, it did produce a hit with \"Bed of Roses,\" an adult contemporary-styled ballad that helped sustain the band\\'s popularity. A greatest-hits album called Cross Road appeared in 1994 and yielded another Top Ten ballad, \"Always.\" Around the same time, bassist Alec John Such left the group; Hugh McDonald, who appeared on Bon Jovi recordings stretching back as far as \"Runaway,\" became his unofficial replacement and was featured prominently on the band\\'s next album. Released in the fall of 1995, These Days turned into another U.S. Top Ten, as well as a popular European hit. After appearing in the 1996 film Moonlight and Valentino, Jon Bon Jovi released his first official solo album, Destination Anywhere, in the summer of 1997. During the tail-end of the \\'90s, the members of Bon Jovi engaged in different projects -- Sambora released a sophomore solo set called Undiscovered Soul in 1998 -- before easing back into work in 1999 with a song for EDtv, then beginning work on a full-length record. The resulting album, Crush, appeared in 2000 and constituted something of a comeback in America thanks to the smash single \"It\\'s My Life,\" a cross-platform hit single with long legs. \"Thank You for Loving Me\" also turned into a hit, helping Crush go double platinum in the U.S. and selling eight-million copies worldwide. Bon Jovi quickly followed Crush with their eighth studio effort, Bounce, which appeared in the fall of 2002, and supported the record with another international tour. In 2003, the band re-recorded many of their most well-known songs for the acoustic-based release This Left Feels Right, which also saw an accompanying DVD in 2004. The ambitious outtakes and rarities box set 100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can\\'t Be Wrong arrived in November of that year, followed by the all-new Have a Nice Day -- the first of several albums produced by John Shanks. That record\\'s success was aided in part by the single \"Who Says You Can\\'t Go Home,\" featuring guest vocals from Sugarland\\'s Jennifer Nettles, which eventually won the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals -- as well as topping the charts in Japan, Australia, Europe, and Canada. The group spent the following year in the studio, putting the finishing touches on a collection of pop-infused heartland country anthems. The resulting Lost Highway, which featured duets with LeAnn Rimes and Big &amp; Rich, arrived in the summer of 2007 and grabbed the band a healthy new country music fan base in the process. Lost Highway\\'s cross-genre formula proved to be quite potent, securing Bon Jovi their third number one album in the U.S. The group returned to rock shortly thereafter, though, with the release in 2009 of a somber, searching album titled The Circle. One year later, Greatest Hits: The Ultimate Collection offered plenty of hits along with two new tracks, \"No Apologies\" and \"What Do You Got?\"In the first years of the 2010s, the members of Bon Jovi pursued solo projects, the most notable being Sambora\\'s 2012 solo album Aftermath of the Lowdown. In November 2012, two months after Sambora\\'s album, the band issued Inside Out, a live album for video, recorded at London\\'s O2 Arena, New Jersey\\'s MetLife Stadium, and New York\\'s Madison Square Garden. In March 2013, Bon Jovi returned with What About Now, their first studio album in four years. In similar thematic and musical company as The Circle, it reached number one on the Billboard Top 200, along with topping the charts in Australia and Canada and reaching number two in the U.K. Despite its high debut, What About Now was their first album not to achieve gold certification in the U.S. Soon after the release of What About Now, there was evident turmoil in the Bon Jovi camp. Sambora left the supporting tour in 2013, citing \"personal reasons\" -- he was replaced by guitarist Phil X (Phil Xenidis) -- and then Tico Torres had to undergo gallbladder surgery. Torres returned to the fold, but Sambora did not. In November 2014, the guitarist and band announced they had parted ways; Phil X became his unofficial permanent replacement. Next up for Bon Jovi came 2015\\'s Burning Bridges, a record that was dubbed a \"fan album,\" meaning it was a collection of odds and ends intended as a stopgap as the group completed their first full-fledged post-Sambora album. That record, titled This House Is Not for Sale, appeared on Island in November of 2016, and debuted at number one on the Billboard Top 200. Four years later, Bon Jovi returned with the aptly named full-length Bon Jovi 2020. Released in October 2020, the album was direct and politically charged, qualities crystalized on the pre-release singles \"American Reckoning\" and \"Do What You Can.\" Alec John Such, the group\\'s original bass player, died on June 5, 2022 at the age of 70. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'The Doors mark the moment when the American rock underground of the 1960s came crashing into the mainstream. The group\\'s massive influence on the course of rock music may been overshadowed by decades of lionization of their late lead singer Jim Morrison, whose early death wound up being a pivotal part of their legacy. He seemed to loom larger in his afterlife than he did when he roamed the earth, his posthumous popularity cresting in the \\'80s as the Doors returned to radio airwaves in the wake of their magnum opus \"The End\" soundtracking pivotal moments in Francis Ford Coppola\\'s Apocalypse Now. \"The End\" never appeared as a single but its Oedipal melodrama zeroed in on the Doors\\' appeal back in 1967: the group seemed otherworldly and dangerous, drawing from inspirations not normally heard in rock music. Morrison\\'s heated poetry and hedonism were genuinely new at the time the Doors released their self-titled debut in 1967, as were the droning guitars of Robby Krieger and cascading organ lines of Ray Manzarek, who also played keyboard bass in concert (on record, session musicians often laid down a bass part). Underneath their trippy surface, the Doors were veterans of the Los Angeles garage scene, and their affinity for blues and hard rock gave the band a flinty earthiness that served them well throughout their career; it\\'s certainly evident on their biggest hit singles, including \"Light My Fire,\" \"Love Me Two Times,\" \"Hello, I Love You,\" \"Touch Me,\" and \"Love Her Madly.\" The blend of muscle and mysticism helped shape the parameters of punk and art-rock -- it\\'s difficult to imagine Iggy Pop without the Doors -- and ultimately wound up being their biggest lasting influence, eclipsing the Morrison mythos and years of play on classic rock radio.The roots of the Doors lay in Rick &amp; the Ravens, a fratty rock &amp; roll combo comprising Rick and Jim Manzarek, and featuring their brother Ray on keyboards. Ray had been playing with the group since 1961, sticking with it as he enrolled in UCLA\\'s graduate film program. By happenstance, he met a fellow student by the name of Jim Morrison while they were both on Venice Beach. The pair hit it off and Manzarek encouraged Morrison to sing with Rick &amp; the Ravens. During the course of 1965, Morrison gradually became part of the group, with John Densmore -- a drummer for the Psychedelic Rangers who was an acquaintance of Manzarek\\'s -- joining the band that summer. They headed into Los Angeles\\'s World Pacific Studios to record a demo in September 1965, cutting the first versions of \"Moonlight Drive,\" \"Hello, I Love You,\" and \"Summer\\'s Almost Gone.\" Not long afterward, the band renamed itself the Doors upon the suggestion of Morrison, and they soon lost Rick and Jim Manzarek, along with Pat Hansen (aka Patty Sullivan), the bassist who played on the World Pacific session. Between the two departures came the arrival of Robby Krieger, a guitarist who played with Densmore in the Psychedelic Rangers. The band never replaced Hansen. Manzarek decided to play bass via the Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, which had just hit the market.The Doors scored a residency at the London Fog, a club situated on the Sunset Strip. In the first months of 1966, the group worked out the kinks in their chemistry and material while at that venue, so when they started playing the Whisky A Go Go that summer, they had found their voice. Upon the recommendation of Love\\'s Arthur Lee, Jac Holzman, the president of Elektra Records, and producer Paul A. Rothchild, witnessed two sets from the Doors on August 10, 1966. Just over a week later, the band signed to Elektra, which also was home to Love. Within the next seven days, the Doors were fired from the Whisky thanks to Morrison\\'s on-stage profanity during \"The End\" and they headed into Sunset Sound to record their debut.The Doors headed to stores during the first week of 1967. The band immediately supported the album through local television performances and the release of \"Break on Through,\" which failed to garner much attention nationally. What broke the Doors in America was \"Light My Fire,\" a cascading epic truncated to a tight pop single in April 1967. Over the course of the summer of 1967, \"Light My Fire\" climbed its way to number one on the Billboard Hot 100, an ascent punctuated by an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show where Morrison sang \"girl we couldn\\'t get much higher\" -- in defiance of the request of a tamer lyric on the part of the show\\'s producers -- turning the Doors into stars in the process. By the time \"Light My Fire\" ended its run on the charts, the Doors had their second album, Strange Days, ready to go.Strange Days was knocked out quickly, constructed largely of songs the Doors had been kicking around for a while. The record performed like an aftershock on the charts: it went to number three, thanks largely to its first single \"People Are Strange,\" which just missed the Top 10, peaking at 12. As its second single, \"Love Me Two Times,\" worked its way to its 25 placement, Morrison had his first skirmish with the law. During a concert at New Haven Arena in Connecticut on December 9, 1967, Morrison provoked the police through a number of verbal jabs and the men in blue responded by hauling him off to jail on charges of public obscenity, indecency, and inciting a riot. Charges were eventually dropped due to a lack of evidence, but the incident was instrumental in turning the singer into a rock &amp; roll outlaw while also proving a harbinger for Morrison\\'s reckless behavior.The arrest had no immediate effect on the Doors\\' popularity, which grew during 1968 as the group played bigger concerts, which were sometimes plagued by skirmishes between audiences and the police. Waiting for the Sun, their third album, consolidated this popularity, reaching number one on the strength of its number one single \"Hello, I Love You,\" but the sessions with producer Rothchild were difficult. By that point, the group had exhausted its pre-existing songbook and the producer rejected the side-long suite \"Celebration of the Lizard,\" leaving the band to compose many of the songs in the studio. By the end of the year, the group bounced back with \"Touch Me,\" a boastful single buoyed by blaring horns that gave them a number three hit in early 1969. As the Doors worked on the hit\\'s accompanying album, The Soft Parade, the band\\'s momentum was disrupted by a March 1, 1969 concert in Miami that ended with a warrant being served for Morrison\\'s arrest. The key charge hinged upon an allegation that Morrison exposed himself during a drunken on-stage rant, a charge the singer and the rest of the Doors denied. The singer declined a plea bargain and was convicted to serve six months; he remained free as he pursued an appeal.Morrison\\'s arrests, combined with his increasing alcoholism, wound up hampering the band and, with its heavy-handed orchestral arrangements, The Soft Parade opened the Doors up to accusations of selling out. The Soft Parade still went into the Top 10 upon its summer 1969 release but none of the record\\'s subsequent three singles cracked Billboard\\'s Top 40, a notable slowing in the band\\'s commercial fortunes. Morrison Hotel, the band\\'s harder, streamlined LP from early 1970, also didn\\'t generate a hit -- \"Roadhouse Blues,\" the flip of its single \"You Make Me Real,\" would later be an album rock staple -- yet it found the band righting itself artistically; audiences responded by sending the album to number four on Billboard. Bolstered by the summer release of the concert album, the Doors toured throughout 1970, often holding concerts that came under the fire of local municipalities, conflicts fueled by Morrison\\'s reckless behavior. The year culminated with Morrison walking out of a December 12 show in New Orleans; it turned out to be the last concert he\\'d play with the Doors.In the first months of 1971, the Doors wrapped up the recording of L.A. Woman, an album that found them severing ties with their longtime producer Rothchild; he was replaced by Bruce Botnick. Extending the harder sound of Morrison Hotel, L.A. Woman appeared in the spring of 1971 accompanied by the single \"Love Her Madly.\" The single went to 11 on Billboard\\'s Top 40, followed by a number 14 placement for the moody \"Riders on the Storm,\" with the album reaching nine on the album chart. The group\\'s comeback was short-lived: Jim Morrison was found dead on July 3, 1971, just weeks after the release of L.A. Woman.Morrison\\'s early death cemented his place in rock\\'s firmament, but the Doors did not disband in the wake of his passing. At the time of his death, Krieger, Manzarek, and Densmore were in the thick of recording a new album, expecting that the singer would add vocals sometime during the summer of 1971. When he died, the band finished the LP that became Other Voices -- the guitarist and keyboardist split lead vocal duties -- releasing it in October of that year and supporting it with live shows; it performed respectably on the charts, reaching 31 on Billboard. Full Circle followed less than a year later, reaching 68 -- an underwhelming position, considering how the compilation Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine went to 55 earlier that year -- but by that point the band was on its last legs, and they split in 1973A few years later, the surviving Doors reconvened to set several spoken word recordings by Jim Morrison to music. The resulting An American Prayer appeared in 1978, the first flowering of a Jim Morrison revival that spilled into the \\'80s. An American Prayer didn\\'t sell well but Francis Ford Coppola\\'s 1979 Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now had two sequences featuring \"The End,\" exposing the band\\'s darker side to new audiences. A year later, No One Here Gets Out Alive -- a biography of Morrison by Jerry Hopkins and Danny Sugerman -- was published and it became a hit, leading to Doors\\' songs returning to FM airwaves and the release of a Greatest Hits album. This surge of interest in the band led Rolling Stone to put the singer on the cover in September of 1981 with the tagline \"Jim Morrison: He\\'s Hot, He\\'s Sexy and He\\'s Dead.\" In the article, Bryn Bridenthal, the public relations vice-president at Elektra/Asylum Records claimed, \"We\\'ve sold more Doors records this year than in any year since they were first released.\" Throughout the \\'80s, the interest in the Doors didn\\'t wane, thanks to a series of archival releases kickstarted by 1983\\'s Alive, She Cried, a compilation of concert performances that peaked at 23 on Billboard. Four years later, the Live at the Hollywood Bowl album was released.This resurgence of interest in the Doors culminated in March 1991, when Oliver Stone\\'s biopic -- starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison and Kyle MacLachlan as Ray Manzarek, with Kevin Dillon portraying John Densmore and Frank Whaley playing Robby Krieger -- hit the theaters. In its wake, the live album In Concert appeared in the stores. The Doors were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1993, and then released a career-spanning compilation The Doors Box Set in 1997, which featured the surviving members reuniting to finish off the outtake \"Orange County Suite.\" The low-key reunion continued in 2000 when the group recorded a spot on VH1\\'s Storytellers, which featured guest spots by many newer rockers, including Scott Weiland, Scott Stapp, and Train\\'s Pat Monahan. Also arriving in 2000 was the tribute album Stoned Immaculate: The Music of the Doors and the launch of the Bright Midnight series of archival concerts. Over the next two decades, Bright Midnight released notable live performances on a regular basis. In 2002, Manzarek and Krieger teamed up for a new project called the Doors of the 21st Century featuring Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals. Within a year, Densmore filed an injunction against the pair over the use of the Doors\\' name, leading the guitarist and keyboardist to tour under variations of their surnames.Ray Manzarek died from bile duct cancer at the age of 74 in May 2013. After his death, Krieger and Densmore reunited in tribute at the benefit concert Stand Up to Cancer. In 2020, the pair teamed up again for the Homeward Bound Concert, a charity event in Los Angeles; for this event, they played with Krist Novoselic of Nirvana, Micah Nelson and Haley Reinhart. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'By the time the Rolling Stones began calling themselves the World\\'s Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Band in the late \\'60s, they had already staked out an impressive claim on the title. As the self-consciously dangerous alternative to the bouncy Merseybeat of the Beatles in the British Invasion, the Stones had pioneered the gritty, hard-driving blues-based rock &amp; roll that came to define hard rock. With his preening machismo and latent maliciousness, Mick Jagger became the prototypical rock frontman, tempering his macho showmanship with a detached, campy irony while Keith Richards and Brian Jones wrote the blueprint for sinewy, interlocking rhythm guitars. Backed by the strong yet subtly swinging rhythm section of bassist Bill Wyman and drummer Charlie Watts, the Stones became the breakout band of the British blues scene, eclipsing such contemporaries as the Animals and Them. Over the course of their career, the Stones never really abandoned blues, but as soon as they gained popularity in the U.K., they began experimenting musically, incorporating the British pop of contemporaries like the Beatles, the Kinks, and the Who into their sound. After a brief dalliance with psychedelia, the Stones re-emerged in the late \\'60s as a jaded, blues-soaked hard rock quintet. They had always flirted with the seedy side of rock &amp; roll, but as the hippie dream began to break apart, they exposed and reveled in the new rock culture. It wasn\\'t without difficulty, of course. Shortly after he was fired from the group, Jones was found dead in a swimming pool, while at a 1969 free concert at Altamont, a concertgoer was brutally killed during a Stones show. But the Stones never stopped going. For the next 50-plus years, they continued to record and perform, and while their records weren\\'t always blockbusters, they were never less than the most visible band of their era; certainly, none of their British peers continued to be as popular or productive as the Stones. No band since has proven to have such a broad fan base or such far-reaching popularity, and it is impossible to hear any of the groups that followed them without detecting some sort of influence, whether it was musical or aesthetic. Throughout their career, Mick Jagger (vocals) and Keith Richards (guitar, vocals) remained at the core of the Rolling Stones. The pair initially met as children at Dartford Maypole County Primary School. They drifted apart over the next ten years, eventually making each other\\'s acquaintance again in 1960, when they met through a mutual friend, Dick Taylor, who was attending Sidcup Art School with Richards. At the time, Jagger was studying at the London School of Economics and playing with Taylor in the blues band Little Boy Blue &amp; the Blue Boys. Shortly afterward, Richards joined the band. Within a year, they had met Brian Jones (guitar, vocals), a Cheltenham native who had dropped out of school to play saxophone and clarinet. By the time he became a fixture on the British blues scene, Jones already had a wild life. He ran away to Scandinavia when he was 16 and had already fathered two children. He returned to Cheltenham after a few months, where he began playing with the Ramrods. Shortly afterward, he moved to London, where he played in Alexis Korner\\'s group, Blues Inc. Jones quickly decided he wanted to form his own group and advertised for members; among those he recruited was blues pianist Ian Stewart. As he played with his group, Jones also moonlighted under the name Elmo Jones at the Ealing Blues Club. At the pub, he became reacquainted with Blues, Inc., which now featured drummer Charlie Watts, and, on occasion, cameos by Jagger and Richards. Jones became friends with Jagger and Richards, and they soon began playing together with Taylor and Stewart; during this time, Jagger was elevated to the status of Blues, Inc.\\'s lead singer. With the assistance of drummer Tony Chapman, the fledgling band recorded a demo tape. After it was rejected by EMI, Taylor left the band to attend the Royal College of Art; he would later form the Pretty Things. Before Taylor\\'s departure, the group named itself the Rolling Stones, borrowing the moniker from a Muddy Waters song. The Rolling Stones gave their first performance at the Marquee Club in London on July 12, 1962. At the time, the group consisted of Jagger, Richards, Jones, pianist Ian Stewart, drummer Mick Avory, and Dick Taylor, who had briefly returned to the fold. Weeks after the concert, Taylor left again and was replaced by Bill Wyman, formerly of the Cliftons. Avory also left the group -- he would later join the Kinks -- and the Stones hired Tony Chapman, who proved to be unsatisfactory. After a few months of persuasion, the band recruited Charlie Watts, who had quit Blues, Inc. to work at an advertising agency once that group\\'s schedule became too hectic. By 1963, the band\\'s lineup was set, and the Stones began an eight-month residency at the Crawdaddy Club, which proved to substantially increase their fan base. It also attracted the attention of Andrew Loog Oldham, who became the Stones\\' manager, signing them from underneath the Crawdaddy Club\\'s Giorgio Gomelsky. Although Oldham didn\\'t know much about music, he was gifted at promotion, and he latched upon the idea of fashioning the Stones as the bad-boy opposition to the clean-cut Beatles. At his insistence, the heavyset yet meek Stewart was forced out of the group, since his appearance contrasted with the rest of the bandmembers\\'. Stewart didn\\'t disappear from the Stones, though; he became one of their key roadies and played on their albums and tours until his death in 1985. With Oldham\\'s help, the Rolling Stones signed with Decca Records, and that June released their debut single, a cover of Chuck Berry\\'s \"Come On.\" The single became a minor hit, reaching number 21, and the group supported it with appearances on festivals and package tours. At the end of the year, they released a version of Lennon-McCartney\\'s \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" that soared into the Top 15. Early in 1964, they released a cover of Buddy Holly\\'s \"Not Fade Away,\" which shot to number three. \"Not Fade Away\" became their first American hit, reaching number 48 that spring. By that time, the Stones were notorious in their homeland. Considerably rougher and sexier than the Beatles, the Stones were the subject of numerous sensationalized articles in the British press, culminating in a story about them urinating in public. All of these stories cemented the group as a dangerous, rebellious band in the minds of the public, and had the effect of beginning a manufactured rivalry between them and the Beatles, which helped the group rocket to popularity in the U.S. In the spring of 1964, the Stones released their eponymous debut album, which was followed by \"It\\'s All Over Now,\" their first U.K. number one. That summer, they toured America to riotous crowds, recording the Five by Five EP at Chess Records in Chicago in the midst of the tour. By the time it was over, they had another number one U.K. single with Howlin\\' Wolf\\'s \"Little Red Rooster.\" Although the Stones had achieved massive popularity, Oldham decided to push Jagger and Richards into composing their own songs, since they -- and his publishing company -- would receive more money that away. In June of 1964, the group released their first original single, \"Tell Me (You\\'re Coming Back),\" which became their first American Top 40 hit. Shortly afterward, a version of Irma Thomas\\' \"Time Is on My Side\" became their first U.S. Top Ten. It was followed by \"The Last Time\" in early 1965, a number one U.K. and Top Ten U.S. hit that began a virtually uninterrupted string of Jagger-Richards hit singles. Still, it wasn\\'t until the group released \"(I Can\\'t Get No) Satisfaction\" in the summer of 1965 that they were elevated to superstars. Driven by a fuzz-guitar riff designed to replicate the sound of a horn section, \"Satisfaction\" signaled that Jagger and Richards had come into their own as songwriters, breaking away from their blues roots and developing a signature style of big, bluesy riffs and wry, sardonic lyrics. It stayed at number one for four weeks and began a string of Top Ten singles that ran for the next two years, including such classics as \"Get Off My Cloud,\" \"19th Nervous Breakdown,\" \"As Tears Go By,\" and \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" By 1966, the Stones had decided to respond to the Beatles\\' increasingly complex albums with their first album of all-original material, Aftermath. Due to Brian Jones\\' increasingly exotic musical tastes, the record boasted a wide range of influences, from the sitar-drenched \"Paint It, Black\" to the Eastern drones of \"I\\'m Going Home.\" These eclectic influences continued to blossom on Between the Buttons (1967), the most pop-oriented album the group ever made. Ironically, the album\\'s release was bookended by two of the most notorious incidents in the band\\'s history. Before the record was released, the Stones performed the suggestive \"Let\\'s Spend the Night Together,\" the B-side to the medieval ballad \"Ruby Tuesday,\" on The Ed Sullivan Show, which forced Jagger to alter the song\\'s title to an incomprehensible mumble, or else face being banned. In February of 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested for drug possession, and within three months, Jones was arrested on the same charge. All three were given suspended jail sentences, and the group backed away from the spotlight as the summer of love kicked into gear in 1967. Jagger, along with his then-girlfriend Marianne Faithfull, went with the Beatles to meet the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; they were also prominent in the international broadcast of the Beatles\\' \"All You Need Is Love.\" Appropriately, the Stones\\' next single, \"Dandelion\"/\"We Love You,\" was a psychedelic pop effort, and it was followed by their response to Sgt. Pepper\\'s, Their Satanic Majesties Request, which was greeted with lukewarm reviews.The Stones\\' infatuation with psychedelia was brief. By early 1968, they had fired Andrew Loog Oldham and hired Allen Klein as their manager. The move coincided with their return to driving rock &amp; roll, which happened to coincide with Richards\\' discovery of open tunings, a move that gave the Stones their distinctively fat, powerful sound. The revitalized Stones were showcased on the malevolent single \"Jumpin\\' Jack Flash,\" which climbed to number three in May 1968. Their next album, Beggar\\'s Banquet, was finally released in the fall, after being delayed for five months due its controversial cover art of a dirty, graffiti-laden restroom. An edgy record filled with detours into straight blues and campy country, Beggar\\'s Banquet was hailed as a masterpiece among the fledgling rock press. Although it was seen as a return to form, few realized that while it opened a new chapter of the Stones\\' history, it was also the end of their time with Brian Jones. Throughout the recording of Beggar\\'s Banquet, Jones was on the sidelines due to his deepening drug addiction and his resentment of the dominance of Jagger and Richards. Jones left the band on June 9, 1969, claiming to be suffering from artistic differences between himself and his bandmembers. On July 3, 1969 -- less than a month after his departure -- Jones was found dead in his swimming pool. The coroner ruled that it was \"death by misadventure,\" yet his passing was the subject of countless rumors over the next two years. By the time of his death, the Stones had already replaced Jones with Mick Taylor, a former guitarist for John Mayall\\'s Bluesbreakers. He wasn\\'t featured on \"Honky Tonk Women,\" a number one single released days after Jones\\' funeral, and he contributed only a handful of leads on their next album, Let It Bleed. Released in the fall of 1969, Let It Bleed comprised sessions with Jones and Taylor, yet it continued the direction of Beggar\\'s Banquet, signaling that a new era in the Stones\\' career had begun, one marked by ragged music and an increasingly wasted sensibility. Following Jagger\\'s filming of Ned Kelly in Australia during the first part of 1969, the group launched its first American tour in three years. Throughout the tour -- the first where they were billed as the World\\'s Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Band -- the group broke attendance records, but it was given a sour note when they staged a free concert at Altamont Speedway. On the advice of the Grateful Dead, the Stones hired Hell\\'s Angels as security, but that plan backfired tragically. The entire show was unorganized and in shambles, and it turned tragic when the Angels killed a young Black man, Meredith Hunter, during the Stones\\' performance. In the wake of the public outcry, the Stones again retreated from the spotlight and dropped \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" which some critics ignorantly claimed incited the violence, from their set. As the group entered a hiatus, they released the live Get Yer Ya-Ya\\'s Out! in the fall of 1970. It was their last album for Decca/London, and they formed Rolling Stones Records, which became a subsidiary of Atlantic. During 1970, Jagger starred in Nicolas Roeg\\'s cult film Performance and married Nicaragua model Bianca Perez Morena de Macias; the couple quickly entered high society. As Jagger was jet-setting, Richards was slumming, hanging out with country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons. Keith wound up having more musical influence on 1971\\'s Sticky Fingers, the first album the Stones released through their new label. Following its release, the band retreated to France in tax exile, where they shared a house and recorded a double album, Exile on Main St. Upon its May 1972 release, Exile on Main St. was widely panned, but over time it came to be considered one of the group\\'s defining moments. Following Exile, the Stones began to splinter in two, as Jagger concentrated on being a celebrity and Richards sank into drug addiction. The band remained popular throughout the \\'70s, but their critical support waned. Goats Head Soup, released in 1973, reached number one, as did 1974\\'s It\\'s Only Rock \\'n\\' Roll, but neither record was particularly well-received. Taylor left the band after It\\'s Only Rock \\'n\\' Roll, and the group recorded their next album as they auditioned new lead guitarists, including Jeff Beck. They finally settled on Ron Wood, former lead guitarist for the Faces and Rod Stewart, in 1976, the same year they released Black n\\' Blue, which only featured Wood on a handful of cuts. During the mid- and late \\'70s, all the Stones pursued side projects, with both Wyman and Wood releasing solo albums with regularity. Richards was arrested in Canada in 1977 with his common-law wife Anita Pallenberg for heroin possession. After his arrest, he cleaned up and was given a suspended sentence the following year. The band reconvened in 1978 to record Some Girls, an energetic response to punk, new wave, and disco. The record and its first single, the thumping disco-rocker \"Miss You,\" both reached number one, and the album restored the group\\'s image. However, the band squandered that goodwill with the follow-up, Emotional Rescue, a number one record that nevertheless received lukewarm reviews upon its 1980 release. Tattoo You, released the following year, fared better both critically and commercially, as the singles \"Start Me Up\" and \"Waiting on a Friend\" helped the album spend nine weeks at number one. The Stones supported Tattoo You with an extensive stadium tour captured in Hal Ashby\\'s movie Let\\'s Spend the Night Together and the 1982 live album Still Life. Tattoo You proved to be the last time the Stones completely dominated the charts and the stadiums. Although they continued to sell out concerts in the \\'80s and \\'90s, their records didn\\'t sell as well as previous efforts, partially because the albums suffered due to Jagger and Richards\\' notorious mid-\\'80s feud. Starting with 1983\\'s Undercover, the duo were conflicted about which way the band should go, with Jagger wanting the Stones to follow contemporary trends and Richards wanting them to stay true to their rock roots. As a result, Undercover was a mean-spirited, unfocused record that had relatively weak sales and mixed reviews. Released in 1986, Dirty Work suffered a worse fate, since Jagger was preoccupied with his fledgling solo career. Once Jagger decided that the Stones would not support Dirty Work with a tour, Richards decided to make his own solo record with 1988\\'s Talk Is Cheap. Appearing a year after Jagger\\'s failed second solo album, Talk Is Cheap received good reviews and went gold, prompting Jagger and Richards to reunite late in 1988. The following year, the Stones released Steel Wheels, which was received with good reviews, but the record was overshadowed by its supporting tour, which grossed over 140 million dollars and broke many box office records. In 1991, the live album Flashpoint, which was culled from the Steel Wheels shows, was released. Following the release, Bill Wyman left the band; he published a memoir, Stone Alone, within a few years of leaving. The Stones didn\\'t immediately replace Wyman, since they were all working on solo projects; this time, there was none of the animosity surrounding their mid-\\'80s projects. The group reconvened in 1994 with bassist Darryl Jones, who had previously played with Miles Davis and Sting, to record and release the Don Was-produced Voodoo Lounge. The album received the band\\'s strongest reviews in years, and its accompanying tour was even more successful than the Steel Wheels tour. On top of being more successful than its predecessor, Voodoo Lounge also won the Stones their first Grammy for Best Rock Album. Upon the completion of the Voodoo Lounge tour, the Stones released the live \"unplugged\" album Stripped in the fall of 1995. Similarly, after wrapping up their tour in support of 1997\\'s Bridges to Babylon, the group issued yet another live set, No Security, the following year. A high-profile greatest-hits tour in 2002 was launched despite the lack of a studio album to support, and its album document, Live Licks, appeared in 2004. A year later, the group issued A Bigger Bang, their third effort with producer Don Was. In 2006, Martin Scorsese filmed two of the group\\'s performances at New York City\\'s Beacon Theatre. The resulting Shine a Light, which included guest appearances from Buddy Guy, Jack White, and Christina Aguilera, was released in theaters in 2008. The accompanying soundtrack reached the number two spot on the U.K. charts. Following Shine a Light, the Stones turned their attention toward their legacy. For Keith Richards, this meant delving into writing his autobiography, Life -- the memoir was published to acclaim in the fall of 2010 and generated some controversy due to comments Keith made about Mick -- but the Stones in general spent time mining their archives, something they\\'d previously avoided. In 2010, they released a super-deluxe edition of Exile on Main St. that contained a bonus disc of rarities and outtakes, including a few newly finished songs like \"Plundered My Soul.\" This was followed in 2011 by a super-deluxe edition of Some Girls that also contained unheard songs and outtakes. That same year, the Stones opened up their Rolling Stones Archive, which offered official digital releases of classic live bootlegs like 1973\\'s The Brussels Affair. All this was a prelude to their 50th anniversary in 2012, which the group celebrated with a hardcover book, a documentary called Crossfire Hurricane, and a new compilation called GRRR! The Stones also played a handful of star-studded concerts at the end of the year and in the first half of 2013, several of which featured guest spots from the long-departed Mick Taylor. These live shows culminated with a headlining spot at Glastonbury and two July 2013 concerts at Hyde Park; highlights from the Hyde Park shows were released that July and, later in the year, there was a home video/CD release of the concert called Sweet Summer Sun: Live in Hyde Park. Over the next few years, the Stones played concerts regularly -- a highlight was a March 2016 concert in Havana, Cuba -- and slowly worked on an album that was teased in September 2016, the same week their Decca/London works were released as the box set The Rolling Stones in Mono. On December 2, 2016, the Stones released Blue &amp; Lonesome, a collection of Chicago blues covers that was their first studio album in 11 years. The Stones had two major archival projects released in the last quarter of 2017: a 50th anniversary edition of Their Satanic Majesties Request and On Air, the first official release of their \\'60s BBC recordings. The band\\'s 2018 No Filter tour of Europe spilled over into 2019 when they announced it would include a massive stadium tour of the U.S. The tour was delayed due to Jagger\\'s need for emergency heart surgery -- he recovered successfully, and the band returned to the road -- but the release of the new compilation Honk was undisturbed. Concentrating on music made since 1971, Honk appeared in April 2019. Later that year came the arrival of the live LP/concert film Bridges to Bremen, which captured the group performing in the German city on September 2, 1998, in support of the Bridges to Babylon album. A 50th anniversary edition of Let It Bleed also appeared in 2019. In April 2020, the Stones released the single \"Living in a Ghost Town.\" It was their first new material since 2012, taken from sessions for a studio album that the band had been working toward since 2015. Later that year, they released a deluxe reissue of Goats Head Soup. On August 5, 2021, the Rolling Stones announced that Watts would be unable to appear with the band on an upcoming United States tour (already postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic) due to health concerns, and that Steve Jordan (who had worked with Keith Richards on a number of projects) would be taking his place. Less than three weeks later, Charlie Watts died in a London hospital on August 24, 2021; he was 80 years old. The Rolling Stones resumed their No Filter tour in September 2021, staying on the road through the end of the year. Jordan remained in the drummer\\'s seat for the celebratory Sixty Tour in 2022. During that year, the Stones also dug into their archive for Live at the El Mocambo, presenting the first official release of a heavily bootlegged pair of small club dates from 1977. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Legends and innovators of the Southern California punk scene, The Offspring have seen massive global success. The story began when their punk pop sound became a popular sensation in 1994. The Offspring released their self-titled debut album in 1989. Four years later, their 2nd album, Ignition, became an underground hit, setting the stage for the huge success of their 3rd album 1994's Smash which paved the way to radio success. The Offspring were played on both alternative and album rock stations, confirming their broad-based appeal.Five successful gold and platinum albums followed: Ixnay on the Hombre; Americana; Conspiracy of One; Splinter; Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace; and Days Go By. The band's 10th album was their first in 8 years. But 2021 was the year that SoCal legends released their blistering new album Let the Bad Times Roll. Album highlights include the title track which takes a critical eye at the state of America in recent years, the devastating urgency of The Opioid Diaries, and the horn-fueled skank of “We Never Have Sex Anymore” a song that nods to the band's cheeky humor. The Offspring have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide, won countless awards, and have toured consistently, playing more than 500 shows in the last decade alone. The band's music has had a lasting impact across film, television, and gaming and continues to make its mark on pop culture today.\"\n",

      "'Known to the world as \"That Lil\\' Ol\\' Band from Texas,\" ZZ Top had a thoroughly unique career. They started as a trio putting their own spin on blues &amp; boogie rock, and became arena rock stars in the 1970s. In the \\'80s, they cannily reinvented themselves, hot-wiring their sound with sequencers and synthesizers and becoming unlikely MTV heroes with a series of clever videos that turned bearded frontmen Billy Gibbons (guitar) and Dusty Hill (bass) into an eccentric visual signature. This gambit made them one of the only groups of their era to not only survive in the new arena of pop, but to become more popular than ever, gaining a new audience without sacrificing the old one. At their core, ZZ Top\\'s songs never changed that much, taking standard blues figures, filtering them through Gibbons\\' precisely raunchy guitar, marrying them to the simple but funky groove of Hill and drummer Frank Beard, and adding lyrics steeped in surreal wit as they dealt with sex, booze, the blues, and the glorious idiosyncrasies of life in Texas. Their stardom faded a bit in the mid-\\'90s as their albums stopped topping the charts, but they remained a popular live act that could reliably fill large venues and give fans a great show more than 50 years after the act debuted. 1973\\'s Tres Hombres was their first major success and the point where their trademark sound found itself, 1983\\'s Eliminator introduced the streamlined, new wave-influenced approach that brought them their greatest success, and 2012\\'s La Futura, the final studio album from the original trio, was a return to form that delivered Lone Star guitar raunch with flashes of electronic sheen.ZZ Top was formed in 1969 by guitarist and songwriter Billy Gibbons. Born in Houston, Texas in 1949, Gibbons was the son of a musician who encouraged his passion for music; when he initially showed interest in playing percussion instruments, his father arranged for him to take lessons with Latin music icon Tito Puente. However, witnessing a recording session with B.B. King had a greater impact on the young Gibbons, and for his 13th birthday, he was given an electric guitar and an amp. He started playing in rock bands when he was living in California with his family, but it wasn\\'t until he returned to Texas that he formed his first band of note, the Moving Sidewalks, a psychedelic outfit who cut a local hit called \"99th Floor\" (a nod to the 13th Floor Elevators, who Gibbons acknowledged as a key influence) and an album called Flash. Not long after Flash was released, the Moving Sidewalks broke up after two of Gibbons\\' bandmates were drafted into the Army, and he chose to form a more blues-oriented group. With Moving Sidewalks drummer Dan Mitchell and Neil Ford &amp; the Fanatics bassist Lanier Greig, Gibbons assembled a blues and boogie power trio he called ZZ Top (ZZ from bluesman Z.Z. Hill, and Top as a play on King, as in B.B. King). With manager Bill Ham serving as producer, the new band cut a single for the local Scat Records label, \"Salt Lick\" b/w \"Miller\\'s Farm.\" It would be the only recorded document of ZZ Top\\'s first lineup; creative differences led to Greig and Mitchell leaving the band, and Gibbons recruited a new rhythm section, bassist Billy Etheridge (who would later work with Stevie Ray Vaughan) and drummer Frank Beard (born in 1949, he had played with the Texas blues-rock band American Blues, cutting three albums with the combo). After shopping ZZ Top around to a number of record labels, Ham persuaded London Records to take a chance on them. Etheridge was unhappy with the terms of the contract and chose not to sign, quitting the group. In need of a bass player, Beard suggested they bring in Dusty Hill (also born in 1949, in this case in Dallas), who had been his bandmate in American Blues. This lineup would soon go into the studio and cut 1971\\'s ZZ Top\\'s First Album, and would work together for the next 50 years.ZZ Top were back in 1972 with the LP Rio Grande Mud; it contained \"Francine,\" which became a minor hit single (peaking at 69 on the Hot 100) and \"Just Got Paid,\" which would become a staple of their live shows. It also turned up the boogie in their approach, gave Gibbons more room for his dirty guitar attack, and sounded tighter and more confident than the debut. Their real breakthrough came with their third album, 1973\\'s Tres Hombres; it marked the point where their trademark sound coalesced for the first time, and it spawned the single \"La Grange,\" a celebration of a notorious Texas brothel, that earned major airplay on rock radio and just missed making the Top 40. Tres Hombres was the first ZZ Top album to make the Top Ten, and earned them their first gold record. The band became a major touring attraction, and their next long-player, 1975\\'s Fandango, featured one side recorded at a sold-out show while the flipside was recorded in the studio and featured \"Tush,\" which hit the singles chart at number 20, making it their first entry into the Top 40. The trio next hit the road with an elaborate stage show they called the Worldwide Texas Tour, which included extravagant painted backdrops, a stage in the shape of the Lone Star State, and a variety of local flora and fauna, including cactus and yucca plants, a steer, a buffalo, and several rattlesnakes. As the Worldwide Texas Tour crossed the country in 1976 and 1977, ZZ Top brought out 1976\\'s Tejas, which was the last album under their contract with London. After the grueling Texas Tour finally came to an end, the group went on a vacation that ended up lasting almost three years. During that time, Gibbons traveled to Europe and Jamaica as he explored new sounds, Hill pacified his mind working at an airport in Dallas, and Beard went into rehab to shake an addiction to drugs. During the group\\'s downtime, Ham negotiated a new record deal for ZZ Top with Warner Bros. Records, and brought along their London catalog as part of the deal. Degüello, issued in November 1979, showed off a leaner and more idiosyncratic sound and scored two more radio favorites in \"Cheap Sunglasses\" and \"I\\'m Bad, I\\'m Nationwide,\" and a Top 40 single in their cover of Sam &amp; Dave\\'s \"I Thank You.\" On their subsequent concert tour, ZZ Top also showed off a new visual signature; Gibbons and Hill had both grown beards that extended down to their chests, though Beard, of course, settled for a mustache. The edgier sound of Degüello was pushed harder on 1981\\'s El Loco, which introduced synthesizers into the mix and a new wave-influenced punch on the songs \"Tube Snake Boogie\" and \"Pearl Necklace.\" If Degüello and El Loco suggested ZZ Top were moving away from their classic boogie-blues attack, 1983\\'s Eliminator was where they truly jumped into the deep end; synthesizers, sequencers, and electronic effects shared equal space with Gibbons\\' guitar and their witty but blues-bent lyrics, and Eliminator became a multi-platinum splash on the strength of a string of hit singles -- including \"Legs,\" \"Sharp Dressed Man,\" \"Got Me Under Pressure,\" and \"TV Dinners\" -- and music videos that made the veteran rockers the toast of MTV. Eliminator became the biggest album of ZZ Top\\'s career, and they followed a similar approach on 1985\\'s Afterburner and 1990\\'s Recycler, both of which were major chart successes through they didn\\'t match the sales of Eliminator. In 1987, the band brought out The ZZ Top Six Pack, a three-CD set that included the albums ZZ Top\\'s First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, Fandango, Tejas, and El Loco. However, the albums were presented in new mixes designed to make them resemble the sound the band introduced on Eliminator, making the release controversial among their older fans. (The 2013 box set The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990 would later present all the albums in their original form.)In 1992, Warner Bros. released ZZ Top\\'s Greatest Hits, a collection that featured a cover of Elvis Presley\\'s \"Viva Las Vegas\" that became another MTV hit. It was their final album for the label, and in 1993, the group revealed they\\'d signed a $35 million deal with RCA Records. Their first RCA LP, 1994\\'s Antenna, found the group reclaiming some of the raunch of their pre-Eliminator era, but while the disc went platinum, it wasn\\'t a hit on the level of the three albums that preceded it. They dug back into the blues with 1996 Rhythmeen and 1999\\'s XXX (released as they celebrated their 30th anniversary) followed the template of Fandango with one studio side and one recorded live, but neither album made a significant impression on fans or the sales charts. In 2003, ZZ Top closed out their RCA contract with Mescalero, while Warner Bros. released a four-disc box set, Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ: The ZZ Top Box, that delivered a thorough overview of their pre-RCA era; a more concise two-disc set, Rancho Texicano: The Very Best of ZZ Top, was issued the following year. 2004 saw ZZ Top inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, with Keith Richards delivering the induction speech. The band put their focus on touring over the next several years, and a concert recording, Live from Texas, was released in audio and video formats in 2008. Another live DVD set, Double Down Live, followed in 2009, featuring a concert shot for German television in 1980 as well as footage from shows staged in 2007 and 2008 in San Francisco, Paris, and Bixby, Oklahoma. The 1980 show also got an audio release in 2011 under the title Live in Germany 1980. After a long layoff from the studio, ZZ Top signed with American Recordings, and with producer Rick Rubin they made 2012\\'s La Futura, which was hailed by critics as a welcome return to their pre-Eliminator sound. They hit the road to support the release, and another concert collection, Live: Greatest Hits from Around the World, was issued by Suretone in 2016. In October 2017, the band canceled a number of shows when Dusty Hill developed health problems and his doctors insisted he take a break. They were back at work in 2018, and in 2019 they were booked to play an eight-night residency at the Venetian Theater in Las Vegas, the same year a feature-length documentary about the group, That Little Ol\\' Band from Texas, debuted on Netflix. The Covid-19 pandemic shut down the Las Vegas residency after a few shows and kept ZZ Top off the road throughout 2020, but they planned an extensive tour beginning in July 2021 and extending well into 2022. Four dates into the tour, Dusty Hill dropped out after his health issues once again made it necessary for him to return home. On July 23, the trio played their first show without Hill since 1970, with their guitar tech, Elwood Francis, taking over on bass with Hill\\'s blessings. On July 28, 2021, Dusty Hill died at his home in Houston, Texas at the age of 72. Shortly after Hill\\'s passing was revealed to the media, Billy Gibbons released a statement saying Hill insisted the band go on in the event of his death, and that Francis would continue to hold down the bass for the trio. The first album ZZ Top released after Hill\\'s passing was RAW: That Little Ol\\' Band from Texas, a 2022 concert album from the late 2010s capturing the band in the intimate confines of the Texas dancehall Gruene Hall. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'Since their days as Swedish garage rock stalwarts, the Hives have made an art out of brash, witty rock &amp; roll. Though some of their choices -- a strict black-and-white dress code, the guidance of a (possibly imaginary) Svengali named Randy Fitzsimmons -- could have been gimmicky, they backed them up with explosive live performances and a sound inspired by the Stooges, Sonics, and New Bomb Turks. The speedy tempos of 1997\\'s Barely Legal reflected their punk roots, but there were traces of the swaggering style they perfected on 2000\\'s Veni Vidi Vicious, which featured their quintessential song \"Hate to Say I Told You So.\" The early-2000s garage rock revival elevated the band\\'s profile, with 2004\\'s Tyrannosaurus Hives achieving gold sales in multiple countries. They expanded their sound on 2007\\'s The Black and White Album and gave it extra heft on 2012\\'s Lex Hives, but 2023\\'s The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons celebrated the Hives\\' 30th anniversary with some of their tightest, most charismatic songs. The Hives -- lead guitarist/vocalist Nicholaus Arson, drummer Chris Dangerous, bassist Dr. Matt Destruction, rhythm guitarist/vocalist Vigilante Carlstroem, and vocalist Howlin\\' Pelle Almqvist -- formed in 1993 in Fagersta, Sweden, while they were still in their teens. An EP of demos, 1994\\'s Sounds Like Sushi, scored the band a deal with Sidekicks Records, and the label issued the Hives\\' debut EP, Oh Lord! When? How?, in June 1996. The group switched to Burning Heart for their first full-length, September 1997\\'s Barely Legal, which offered more thrashy garage-punk; that year they also embarked on their first U.S. tour. A pair of EPs appeared in 1998: January\\'s A Killer Among Us was a split with the like-minded Pricks, while March\\'s A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T rounded out the Barely Legal song with tracks including a cover of the Adicts\\' \"Numbers.\" To record their second album, the Hives worked with producer Pelle Gunnerfeldt in late 1999. Appearing in April 2000 on Burning Heart and Epitaph, Veni Vidi Vicious propelled the band to a new level of critical acclaim and commercial success thanks to strutting singles like \"Hate to Say I Told You So\" and \"Main Offender.\" The album topped the charts in Sweden, where it was ultimately certified gold, and reached number 63 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart in the U.S. The strength of the album, as well as tours with International Noise Conspiracy and the Hellacopters, led to praise from artists as diverse as Noel Gallagher and Courtney Love, and a deal with Alan McGee\\'s Poptones label in 2001. In the United States, Gearhead Records reissued Barely Legal, A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T, and Hate to Say I Told You So. More touring and the re-release of their singles in the U.K. culminated with the Top Ten debut of October 2001\\'s Your New Favourite Band, a compilation of songs from their two previous albums and EPs. Additionally, \"Hate to Say I Told You So\" and \"Main Offender\" appeared on the U.K. Singles chart after Your New Favourite Band\\'s release. When Veni Vidi Vicious was released in the U.S. in 2002, \"Hate to Say I Told You So\" spent 11 months on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.After spending much of that year touring the U.S. and the U.K., the Hives returned to Sweden in 2003 to start work on their next album. Once again produced by Gunnerfeldt, July 2004\\'s Tyrannosaurus Hives further tightened the band\\'s songcraft and continued their momentum. Along with reaching number one and going gold in Sweden, the album was certified gold in the U.K., where it debuted in the Top Ten and spawned the Top 20 single \"Walk Idiot Walk.\" In the U.S., Tyrannosaurus Hives peaked at number 33 on the 200 Albums chart. In early 2005, the Hives won five awards at the 23rd annual Swedish Grammis, including Artist of the Year, Album of the Year, and Rock Group of the Year. Late in 2006, Howlin\\' Pelle Almqvist collaborated with Moneybrother on \"Jag skriver inte på nått,\" a Swedish-language cover of Operation Ivy\\'s \"Freeze Up\" that appeared on the album Pengabrorsan. Around that time, the band worked with Timbaland on \"Throw It on Me,\" which featured on the producer\\'s 2007 album Timbaland Presents Shock Value. For their fourth album, the Hives took a more expansive and collaborative approach, working with a creative team that included the Neptunes, Jacknife Lee, and Thomas Öberg. Released in October 2007, The Black and White Album incorporated more electronics -- as well as cheers courtesy of the cheerleading squad from the University of Mississippi -- into the band\\'s tightly wound rock. A Top Five hit in Sweden, the album peaked at number 29 in the U.K. and number 65 in the U.S. Around the time of the album\\'s release, the Hives created the song \"Fall Is Just Something Grownups Invented\" for Cartoon Network\\'s 2007 programming; it also appeared on as a bonus track on several editions of The Black and White Album. Early in 2008, the Hives won the Swedish Grammi Award for Best Live Act. Later in the year, the band appeared on several songs on N.E.R.D\\'s album Seeing Sounds and issued Black, White, and Run, a continuous mix of their music that was part of Nike+\\'s Original Run series. That December, their Christmas duet with Cyndi Lauper, \"A Christmas Duel,\" reached number four on the Swedish charts. On July 2010\\'s Tarred and Feathered EP, the Hives covered songs by Zero Boys, Flash and the Pan, and Joy Ryder and Avis Davis. The Hives resurfaced in June 2012 with Lex Hives, their first self-produced album and the first to be released on their own imprint Disques Hives. A return to the band\\'s garage-rock fundamentals, the album was a Top Ten hit in Sweden and entered the Top 40 in Austria and Australia; it reached number 71 in the U.K. and 84 in the U.S. Near the end of 2013, health issues led Destruction to leave the band, with the Johan and Only (a.k.a. Randy member Johan Gustafsson) stepping in on bass duties. Following the release of the 2015 single \"Blood Red Moon,\" the Hives concentrated on performing for several years and played festivals such as Riot Fest and Lollapalooza Paris. In 2019, they issued a pair of singles, \"I\\'m Alive\" and \"Good Samaritan,\" and joined Refused on a U.S. tour (for these dates, drummer Joey Castillo took over for Destruction while he recovered from surgery). During this tour, the Hives recorded the September 2020 live album Live at Third Man Records. When the COVID-19 global pandemic made it impossible for the band to take their show on the road in 2021, they staged The World Wide Web Tour and live-streamed performances at times appropriate for audiences in Berlin, London, New York City, Sydney, São Paulo and Stockholm. Later in the year, they opened for the Offspring on their tour of Europe and the U.K. The Hives worked on their sixth album with producer Patrik Berger, a former member of the punk outfit Snuffed by the Yakuza known for his work with Robyn and Charli XCX. The band and Berger whittled down a pile of demos that became August 2023\\'s The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons. Recorded in a studio owned by ABBA\\'s Benny Andersson, the album encompassed rousing pop-punk, electronic instrumentation, and punchy brass while remaining true to the Hives\\' riff-heavy garage rock. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi'\n",

      "'Combining psych-rock, shoegaze, power pop, synth pop, and more with the cheeky detachment of their pop-art namesake, the Dandy Warhols are equally skilled at heady reveries and satirical pop. Early on, they scored hits with \"Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth\" (from their 1997 major-label debut, The Dandy Warhols Come Down) and \"Bohemian Like You\" (from 2001\\'s Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia), both of which skewered hipster culture with a wit that suggested they were America\\'s answer to Brit-pop. Later in the 2000s, they dabbled in synth-pop on 2003\\'s Welcome to the Monkey House and indulged their excesses on 2005\\'s sprawling Odditorium or Warlords of Mars. Though more restrained efforts such as 2016\\'s Distortland suggested the Dandy Warhols might be mellowing out in their third decade, 2019\\'s freewheeling Why You So Crazy proved they were committed to keeping their listeners guessing. 2020\\'s Tafelmuzik Means More When You\\'re Alone pushed the envelope even further with nearly four hours of mostly instrumental exploration.Vocalist/guitarist Courtney Taylor, keyboardist Zia McCabe, guitarist Peter Holmström, and drummer Eric Hedford formed the Dandy Warhols in Portland, Oregon in 1994. The band signed a deal with the local Tim/Kerr Records after their first show, and their debut album, Dandys Rule OK?, appeared in 1995. Featuring songs such as as \"Lou Weed\" and \"Ride,\" it openly acknowledged the influence of the Velvet Underground and Ride on the band\\'s music.Capitol Records signed the group the same year, but after the label rejected their first attempt at a second album, the band reunited with Dandys Rule OK? producer Tony Lash to make 1997\\'s Dandy Warhols Come Down. A more polished-sounding set than their debut, the album earned the Dandy Warhols more critical acclaim and more substantial commercial success. This was especially true in the U.K., where the album was certified gold and its three singles entered the Top 40. In the U.S., the single \"Not If You Were the Last Junkie on Earth\" hit number 31 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. In 1998, Hedford left the band, with Taylor\\'s cousin Brent DeBoer replacing him as drummer.The Dandy Warhols returned in 2000 with their third album, Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia, which downplayed their psych leanings in favor of sharp-edged pop such as the single \"Bohemian Like You.\" One of the band\\'s definitive songs, it peaked at number 28 on Billboard\\'s Alternative Songs chart in the U.S. and reached number five on the U.K. Singles Chart in 2001. In November of that year, the Dandy Warhols opened the Odditorium, a recording studio in northwest Portland that also functions as an art and event space. In 2002, Holmström married his longtime girlfriend and took her maiden name of Loew. Taylor also changed his name, opting to go by Courtney Taylor-Taylor after an interviewer misinterpreted the pronunciation.To make their fourth album, Welcome to the Monkey House, the Dandy Warhols worked with with Nile Rodgers, Duran Duran\\'s Nick Rhodes, and Evan Dando. After Capitol turned down the original mix by Grammy-winning soul music engineer Russell Elevado, the final version of the album featured a synth pop and new wave-influenced mix by Rhodes. Upon its release in 2003, it went to number 118 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart and spawned another hit for the band, the synth-disco jam \"We Used to Be Friends.\" Following live shows that included supporting David Bowie on a leg of his 2003 A Reality tour, the band remained prominent in 2004 thanks to Ondi Timoner\\'s documentary Dig!, which chronicled the love-hate relationship between the Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre and won the Documentary Grand Jury Prize at that year\\'s Sundance Film Festival. Also in 2004, the band released The Black Album -- their name for their rejected Capitol debut -- and the compilation Come on Feel the Dandy Warhols as a double-album set on their own label Beat the World Records.The Dandy Warhols returned with new music in 2005. Odditorium or Warlords of Mars, an expansive return to the band\\'s psych rock roots, appeared that September, peaking at number 89 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. Soon after, the band contributed a cover of the Everly Brothers\\' \"All I Have to Do Is Dream\" to the soundtrack of the video game Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse (the song also appeared on Stubbs the Zombie: The Soundtrack). A couple of other stand-alone tracks also arrived, including the 2006 single \"Have a Kick Ass Summer (Me and My Friends)\" and the theme song to the 2007 film Good Luck Chuck. The band\\'s sixth album, and first for Beat the World, 2008\\'s Earth to the Dandy Warhols, featured collaborations with Mark Knopfler and the Heartbreakers\\' Mike Campbell; the album reached number 128 on Billboard\\'s 200 Albums chart and spawned two remix EPs.Over the next few years, the Dandy Warhols\\' output included contributions to the Cure tribute album Perfect as Cats and the Love and Rockets tribute album New Tales to Tell: A Tribute to Love and Rockets. They also issued archival releases: Dandy Warhols Are Sound, which presented Russell Elevado\\'s original mix of Welcome to the Monkey House, arrived in 2009, while the following year\\'s greatest-hits collection, Best of the Capitol Years: 1995-2007, included the previously unreleased \"This Is the Tide,\" the first Dandy Warhols song with DeBoer on vocals. During this time, the band\\'s members focused on other projects, ranging from Taylor-Taylor\\'s 2009 graphic novel One Model Nation to DeBoer\\'s 2010 solo debut, The Farmer. Loew\\'s other band, Pete International Airport, also issued their self-titled debut in 2010, while McCabe\\'s country band Brush Prairie released the EP Carry Yourself Back to Me in 2011. That year, the Dandy Warhols recorded an alternate version of the MythBusters theme song that the TV show used until the end of its 2014 season.In 2012, the Dandy Warhols resurfaced with their eighth album This Machine, a more subdued set of songs that hit number 88 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart, a career high for the band. The album, which featured a collaboration with David J, also appeared on the Top Rock Albums and Alternative Albums charts, reaching number 29 and 21, respectively. The following year, they rang in the 13th anniversary of Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia with a deluxe version of the album and a tour that resulted in the band\\'s first-ever live album, 2014\\'s Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia Live at the Wonder. A second live recording, Live at the X-Ray Cafe, was released by Voodoo Doughnut for Record Store Day in 2016; the EP captured their eighth gig ever from 1994. That year, the Dandy Warhols released the patient and pastoral album Distortland, which reached number 43 on Billboard\\'s Rock Albums chart. In 2017, the band issued the single \"Thick Girls Knock Me Out (Richard Starkey),\" while Pete International Airport released its second album, Safer with the Wolves... The Dandy Warhols\\' tenth album, the eclectic Why You So Crazy, arrived in January 2019 and commemorated their 25th anniversary. They followed the next year with the sprawling Tafelmuzik Means More When You\\'re Alone -- a catalog oddity composed of previously recorded improvisations that found bandmembers playing instruments outside of their normal wheelhouses -- which clocked in at over three hours. Released at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with proceeds going to charity, the mostly instrumental set was produced by Jacob Portrait (Unknown Mortal Orchestra) and featured Zia McCabe and Sylvain Sylvain on the album\\'s lone vocal piece, \"Zia Rolls Another.\" Their only other output during this period was a contribution to the Gang of Four covers compilation The Problem of Leisure, their take on \"What We All Want.\" ~ Heather Phares &amp; Neil Z.

      "'Led by singer/songwriter Jason Wade, Lifehouse emerged in the early 2000s with a commercial blend of pop/rock melody and throaty, post-grunge vocals. Wade, who originally tagged the band Blyss upon its inception in 1995, was raised by missionary parents in a variety of locales. He eventually settled in Los Angeles with his mother and took a keen interest in songwriting. Bassist Sergio Andrade lived next door, and the two spent hours in Wade\\'s garage, fine-tuning their original compositions and laying the brickwork for Lifehouse\\'s accessible sound. Those rehearsals paved the way for a self-released album, Diff\\'s Lucky Band, as well as a series of shows at church worship services. Lifehouse resisted the temptation to become a full-fledged Christian band, however, and instead signed a contract with Dreamworks Records as an alternative rock trio. Drummer Jon Palmer completed the lineup. No Name Face marked the band\\'s official debut in the fall of 2000. The album enjoyed double-platinum sales on the strength of \"Hanging by a Moment,\" which was the most played radio track of 2001. In a market dominated by teen pop, Lifehouse stood out as champions of guitar-based music, and their unexpected success drew them back inside the studio to work on a follow-up album. With Brendan O\\'Brien handling production duties, Wade led his band through the recording of Stanley Climbfall during the spring and summer of 2002. The record was released on Dreamworks the following September, but it failed to match the sales of its predecessor. Lifehouse\\'s lineup splintered soon after, with Andrade exiting the group to pursue alternate projects. Wade pieced together a revised Lifehouse and returned in early 2005 with a self-titled third album. For the touring that followed its release, Wade and percussionist Rick Woolstenhulme, Jr. were joined by former AM Radio bassist/vocalist Bryce Soderberg, who remained with the group for its return to alternative rock on 2007\\'s Who We Are. Lifehouse and Who We Are proved to be fairly popular releases, with both albums going gold thanks to a trio of Top 40 singles: \"First Time,\" \"You and Me,\" and \"Whatever It Takes.\" Smoke &amp; Mirrors appeared three years later, sporting a collaboration with rapper/songwriter Kevin Rudolf on the leadoff single \"Halfway Gone.\" Debuting at number six on the Billboard Top 200, Smoke &amp; Mirrors was a successful record and, after a supporting tour, the group entered the studio once again with producer Jude Cole (he helmed S&amp;M) to record its sixth album. Entitled Almeria, the record appeared in December 2012; it was preceded by the single \"Between the Raindrops,\" a duet with pop singer Natasha Bedingfield. Almeria didn\\'t make many waves on the charts -- it reached 55 on Billboard\\'s Top 200, whereas Smoke &amp; Mirrors peaked at number six -- and the group didn\\'t support it with a tour. By the summer, Lifehouse announced they\\'d left their label and were entering a hiatus. Each member pursued their own project -- Wade worked on a solo album, Soderberg started a band called KOMOX, Woolstenhulme, Jr. played with the Goo Goo Dolls -- but by 2014, they had reunited. In May of 2015, they resurfaced with Out of the Wasteland, produced by Jude Cole and released by Ironworks. It debuted at number one on the Top Independent Albums chart. In early summer of 2017, Lifehouse released their first compilation, Greatest Hits, after which the band toured America with Switchfoot. ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi'\n",

      "'At some point in the early 21st century, Radiohead became something more than a band: they became a touchstone for everything that is fearless and adventurous in rock, inheriting the throne from David Bowie, Pink Floyd, and the Talking Heads. The latter group gave the band its name -- it\\'s an album track on 1986\\'s True Stories -- but Radiohead never sounded much like the Heads, nor did they take much from Bowie, apart from their willingness to experiment. Instead, they spliced Floyd\\'s spaciness with U2\\'s messianic arena rock heft, bridging the gap with guitar skronk borrowed from the \\'80s American underground. Jonny Greenwood\\'s jagged, brutal interjections on \"Creep,\" the band\\'s 1993 breakthrough hit, recalled the ugly noise of the Pixies and Nirvana, a sound that translated over the expanse of an ocean, but in the throes of the alternative rock explosion of the mid-\\'90s, Radiohead were the odd band out. America remained besotted with their homegrown sensations, so \"Creep\" was treated as a one-hit wonder, and at home in England, they were seen as dour art-rock students lacking the glamour of neo-glam sensations Suede, and deliberately dodging the beery singalongs of Oasis. During the peak of Brit-pop in 1995, Radiohead released The Bends, a significant leap forward from their 1993 debut, Pablo Honey, and while that gained them some traction, it was 1997\\'s OK Computer that broke down all the doors for the band and changed alternative rock in the process. Expanding their sound with electronica and unapologetic prog rock suites, Radiohead turned into a different band with OK Computer, and the world followed suit. Soon, whenever rock bands dabbled in electronics, it was derived not from tightly sequenced rhythms, but rather, from glassy textures and introspection, a sensibility pioneered by the quintet. Radiohead doubled down on this aesthetic on 2000\\'s Kid A, a record that traded concise hooks for minimal arrangements and jazz, providing a dividing line between an audience that once loved the group for their guitars and those listeners attracted to the band\\'s aspirations. From this point on, Radiohead would occasionally flirt with concise song structures but were drawn toward unusual paths in both their music and business. Once their contract with EMI expired, they remained an independent band, pioneering different avenues of digital releases. They issued 2007\\'s In Rainbows with little warning, letting listeners pay whatever they liked for the record -- cementing Radiohead\\'s reputation as a band compelled to look forward, not back.Every member of Radiohead was a pupil at Oxfordshire\\'s Abingdon School. Ed O\\'Brien (guitar) and Phil Selway (drums) were the eldest, followed by a year by Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano) and Colin Greenwood (bass). These four musicians began playing in 1985, dubbing themselves On a Friday, and before long they added Colin\\'s younger brother Jonny, who\\'d previously played in Illiterate Hands with Yorke\\'s brother Andy and Nigel Powell. Jonny started on keyboards but moved to guitar, yet this incarnation proved short-lived. By 1987, everyone but Jonny left for university, where many members pursued music, but it wasn\\'t until 1991 that the quintet regrouped and started gigging regularly in Oxford. Eventually, they came to the attention of Chris Hufford -- then best-known as the producer of shoegaze stars Slowdive -- who offered the group the chance to record a demo along with his partner Bryce Edge; the two soon became the band\\'s managers. EMI bit at the group\\'s demo, signing them in 1991 and suggesting they change their name. On a Friday became Radiohead and they recorded their debut EP, Drill, with Hufford and Edge, releasing the record in May 1992. Next, the group entered the studio with producers Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to record their full-length debut. The first fruit from these sessions was \"Creep,\" a single released in the U.K. in September of 1992. \"Creep\" didn\\'t go anywhere at first. The British music weeklies slagged it, radio didn\\'t play it, and it limped to number 78 on the charts. Pablo Honey, the band\\'s full-length debut, appeared in February 1993, supported by the single \"Anyone Can Play Guitar,\" but neither release gained much traction in their native U.K. and that May\\'s non-LP single, \"Pop Is Dead,\" didn\\'t help matters much, either. By that point, however, \"Creep\" started to gain attention in other territories. First, the song became a hit in Israel, but the bigger waves came from the United States, which was in the throes of the alternative rock revolution. Influential San Francisco radio station KITS added \"Creep\" to their playlist and it spread along the west coast and onto MTV as it became a genuine hit, nearly topping Billboard\\'s Modern Rock chart and reaching 34 on the Hot 100, a big achievement for a British guitar band. A re-released \"Creep\" turned into a British Top Ten hit, peaking at number seven in the autumn of 1993. The band who\\'d had no success suddenly had more than it could handle.Radiohead kept touring Pablo Honey into 1994, but no subsequent hits were forthcoming, raising the specter of the band as a possible one-hit wonder -- a criticism that weighed heavily on the group, who were anxious to record their new songs. They received the opportunity early in 1994, entering the studio to work with producer John Leckie -- then best-known for his work with the Stone Roses -- with My Iron Lung, an EP released in late 1994, being the first music released from the sessions. Muscular and ambitious, the EP provided a good indication of what would come on 1995\\'s The Bends. Released in March 1995, The Bends not only found Radiohead growing musically -- it was dense and expansive, without skimping on songs -- but also in reputation, as critics in the U.K. embraced the band with the audience eventually following: none of the first three singles (\"High and Dry,\" \"Fake Plastic Trees,\" \"Just\") rose above 17 on the U.K. charts but the final single, \"Street Spirit (Fade Out),\" wound up reaching five in early 1996. Radiohead\\'s rise may have been assisted by the mania cultivated by Brit-pop, a term that didn\\'t quite suit the band -- they were far artier and rock-oriented -- but nevertheless stoked interest in indie guitar bands, which the quintet certainly was. Over in the U.S., The Bends stalled out at 88 on the Billboard charts but the record gained a cult following among listeners and the band never stopped touring, taking North American opening slots for R.E.M. in 1995 and Alanis Morissette in 1996. During 1995 and 1996, the group recorded new material with Nigel Godrich -- an engineer on The Bends sessions who was now the band\\'s producer -- with songs slowly creeping out during the course of the year. \"Lucky\" showed up on War Child\\'s 1995 charity LP The Help Album, \"Talk Show Host\" appeared on a B-side, and \"Exit Music (For a Film)\" showed up on the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann\\'s Romeo &amp; Juliet. The latter showed up on OK Computer, the June 1997 album that proved pivotal in Radiohead\\'s career. \"Paranoid Android,\" a twitchy suite released as a single in May of that year, suggested the ambition of OK Computer -- and by reaching number three, it was the band\\'s biggest hit to date in the U.K., placing them on the cusp of a breakthrough. A breakthrough is precisely what OK Computer turned out to be, a record that proved pivotal not just for Radiohead but for the direction of \\'90s rock. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews and corresponding strong sales, OK Computer closed the doors on the hedonism of Brit-pop and the dour after-effects of grunge while opening a new path to sober, adventurous art-rock where electronics co-existed with guitars. Over the next few years, the band\\'s influence would become readily apparent, but the album made a sizable impact upon its release, too, debuting at number one in the U.K. and earning a Grammy for Best Alternative Album. Radiohead supported it with an international tour, documented in Meeting People Is Easy.By the time Meeting People Is Easy showed up in theaters, the group began work on their fourth album, once again reuniting with producer Godrich. The resulting Kid A doubled down on the experimentalism of OK Computer, embracing electronics and threading in jazz. Appearing in October in 2000, Kid A was one of the first major albums to be pirated through file-sharing services, but this bootlegging had no apparent effect on the sales of the record: it debuted at number one in the U.K. and the U.S., becoming their first American chart-topper. Once again, the album took home the prize for Best Alternative Album at the Grammys and although it didn\\'t produce any hit singles -- indeed, no singles were released from the record -- it was certified platinum in several territories. Amnesiac, a collection of new material initiated during the Kid A sessions, appeared in June of 2001, topping the U.K. charts and reaching two in the U.S. Two singles were pulled from the album -- \"Pyramid Song\" and \"Knives Out\" -- a signal that the album was more commercially accessible than its predecessor. At the end of the year, the band issued I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, and by the summer of 2002, they turned their attention to recording a new album with Godrich. The resulting Hail to the Thief appeared in June of 2003, once again debuting in the upper reaches of the international charts -- number one in the U.K. and number three in the U.S. -- and the group supported the album with live dates culminating in a headlining appearance at the 2004 Coachella Festival that coincided with the release of the B-sides and remix collection COM LAG, a record that helped close out their contract with EMI.Over the next couple of years, Radiohead entered a hiatus as individual members pursued solo projects. Yorke released the heavily electronic solo collection The Eraser in 2006, and Jonny Greenwood embarked on a side career as a composer, beginning with 2004\\'s Bodysong and then striking a fruitful collaboration with Paul Thomas Anderson for 2007\\'s There Will Be Blood; Greenwood would also work on Anderson\\'s subsequent films The Master and Inherent Vice. During all this, the group tentatively chipped away at their first post-EMI album. Some unsuccessful sessions with Spike Stent led the band back to Godrich by the end of 2006, and the group completed recording in June of 2007. Still without a record label, they decided to release the album digitally through their official website, letting users pay whatever they wanted for a download of the album. This novel strategy acted as the album\\'s own promotion -- most of the articles about the release claimed it was revolutionary -- and In Rainbows allegedly moved over a million downloads on the first day of its release in October 2007. In December, the album received a physical release in the U.K., followed by a January 2008 physical release in the U.S.; the record sold well, debuting at number one in the U.K., and it earned Grammys for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package.Radiohead toured in support of In Rainbows into 2009, during which time EMI released Radiohead: The Best Of in June of 2008. The band took time off in 2010, which allowed Yorke to form a band called Atoms for Peace with producer Godrich and Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. During this time, drummer Phil Selway released his debut solo album, Familial. By early 2011, the group finished a new album and, like In Rainbows before it, Radiohead initially released The King of Limbs digitally through their website. The downloads appeared in February, with the physical copies appearing in March; the album reportedly shifted upwards of 400,000 digital copies upon its release. That autumn brought the release of the remix album TKOL RMX 1234567, and the band continued to tour The King of Limbs material into 2012. Once the tour wrapped up, the group took some quiet time as a new round of solo projects appeared. Atoms for Peace released Amok in February 2013 and Yorke put out Tomorrow\\'s Modern Boxes in September 2014, just a month before Selway issued his second album, Weatherhouse. In the autumn of 2014, the band began work on a new album and continued to record throughout 2015, releasing only \"Spectre\" -- a proposed James Bond theme rejected by the filmmakers -- that year. The ninth Radiohead album, A Moon Shaped Pool, appeared on May 8, 2016, preceded earlier in the week by the singles \"Burn the Witch\" and \"Daydreaming.\" Radiohead supported A Moon Shaped Pool with an international tour, and in June of 2017 they celebrated the 20th anniversary of OK Computer with a double-disc reissue dubbed OKNOTOK. Featuring a host of bonus cuts and previously unreleased material, its number two showing on the U.K. charts was bolstered by a major televised live performance at Glastonbury. Over the next year, Selway, Yorke, and Greenwood each issued film soundtracks with the latter earning an Oscar nomination for his score to Phantom Thread. The band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2019, and in 2021 they issued Kid Amnesiae, a collection of previously unreleased material from the Kid A and Amnesiac sessions. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Nine Days was formed on Long Island by singer/songwriter/guitarists John Hampson and Brian Desveaux, who had previously played together and apart in a series of local groups. The band was filled out by keyboard player Jeremy Dean, bass player Nick Dimichino, and drummer Vincent Tattanelli. Focusing on their songwriting and shared lead vocals, Hampson and Desveaux holed up in Hampson's apartment in Deer Park woodshedding, then released their own debut album and began playing live shows. They won WBAB's Homegrown Talent Search and WLIR's Best Unsigned Band competition, made a second CD on their own, and finally signed to Epic/550 Music, which released their debut major-label album, The Madding Crowd (its title a comment on Thomas Hardy's novel Far from the Madding Crowd) in May 2000. ~ William Ruhlmann, Rovi\"\n",

      "'American rock supergroup A Perfect Circle was formed in the late \\'90s by Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan and former Tool guitar tech Billy Howerdel. On their debut, Mer de Noms, A Perfect Circle were seen as an extension of the alt-metal-fused-with-art-rock style popularized by Tool in the early to mid-\\'90s. Despite comparisons, however, A Perfect Circle quickly developed into its own entity, focusing on lighter and more melodic sounds that were combined with a theatrical, ambient quality incorporating occasional strings and unconventional instrumentation on later albums like Thirteenth Step and Eat the Elephant. Over the decades, members of Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, Smashing Pumpkins, and Queens of the Stone Age have played a role in the band\\'s revolving lineup under the core songwriting duo of Keenan and Howerdel.After the release of Ænima in 1996, Tool found themselves in the midst of an extended legal battle with former label Freeworld Entertainment. When the dust settled two years later, the band reached a 50-50 joint venture agreement for future recordings and, feeling a little burned out, decided to take some time off. It was at this point that Keenan joined up with Howerdel and Paz Lenchantin to form A Perfect Circle. Keenan had met Howerdel in 1992 when Tool opened for Fishbone. Howerdel had been Fishbone\\'s tech at the time and he played Keenan a few of his songs. Keenan was impressed and the two talked of collaborating in the future. However, the opportunity wouldn\\'t present itself until the end of the decade. With Keenan on vocals, Howerdel on guitar, and Lenchantin on bass, the trio recruited ex-Failure and Enemy member Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar and ex-Vandals and Guns N\\' Roses member Josh Freese on drums. The quintet rehearsed together but didn\\'t announce the formation of a new band until performing for the first time on August 15, 1999, at a benefit concert at the Viper Room in Los Angeles. Howerdel, who had been composing songs for years, as well as working with bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails, became the band\\'s chief songwriter and producer. A Perfect Circle released their debut album, Mer de Noms, in 2000. Featuring the hit singles \"Judith\" and \"3 Libras,\" Mer de Noms debuted in the Top Five of the Billboard 200 and eventually went platinum. The band opened Nine Inch Nails\\' Fragility Tour in 2000, but soon attracted their own headlining audience. The band took a short break between albums, allowing Keenan to hop back to Tool for the release and promotion of 2001\\'s Lateralus.In the meantime, preparation for A Perfect Circle\\'s sophomore effort continued. Lenchantin and Van Leeuwen -- both involved with other projects at the time -- were swapped out for Jeordie White (Marilyn Manson) and Danny Lohner (Nine Inch Nails), respectively. Keenan returned to the fold in early 2003. Months later, Thirteenth Step arrived, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200. Moodier and more expansive, the set included Top Five rock chart singles \"Weak and Powerless\" and \"The Outsider.\" Lohner made way for James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins) as the band embarked on an international tour. Concluding the trek, A Perfect Circle issued the covers album eMOTIVe in 2004. The politically charged, anti-war collection featured interpretations of songs like John Lennon\\'s \"Imagine,\" Marvin Gaye\\'s \"What\\'s Going On,\" and Depeche Mode\\'s \"People Are People.\" The album was also notable for the inclusion of new track \"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drum\" and \"Passive,\" a holy grail for fans written by Keenan, Howerdel, Lohner, and Trent Reznor for their scrapped Tapeworm project.Shortly after the release of eMOTIVe\\'s companion DVD set aMOTION -- which bundled the band\\'s music videos along with a remix CD -- A Perfect Circle went on a hiatus that would last over a decade. During their downtime, Keenan recorded albums with Tool and his solo project, Puscifer, while Howerdel started a new band, Ashes Divide. While rumors of the band writing songs cropped up now and again, A Perfect Circle returned (to the stage, at least) in 2010, and released a new song, \"By and Down,\" on their 2013 greatest-hits compilation Three Sixty. However, it would be another half-decade before an official return.In late 2017, the group reunited for a tour of the United States, teasing fans with the possibility of a trek to the studio. They issued the single \"The Doomed,\" their first new song in over a decade. \"Disillusioned\" and \"TalkTalk\" followed in early 2018. That April, A Perfect Circle released their fourth LP, Eat the Elephant, with another revamped lineup that added Matt McJunkins (Eagles of Death Metal) and Jeff Friedl (Puscifer) to the Keenan/Howerdel/Iha trio. As political as eMOTIVe and even more melodic than Thirteenth Step, Eat the Elephant also marked the first time the band recruited an outside producer; namely, Dave Sardy. ~ Neil Z.

      "'Outspoken firebrands and activists Rage Against the Machine educated masses of heavy music fans by injecting their bombastic Molotov cocktail of rap, hardcore punk, funk, and metal with a sobering dose of fiercely polemical, politically charged urgency. Crashing the mainstream in 1992 with \"Killing in the Name\" -- their sonic protest against police brutality and systemic racism -- the band planted their flag in the scene with their triple-platinum debut, Rage Against the Machine, which courted controversy with its graphic cover of a protesting, self-immolated Buddhist monk. For the remainder of the decade, Rage continued to push this anti-authoritarian and revolutionary message, extending their platinum streak with subsequent chart-topping Grammy winners Evil Empire (1996) and The Battle of Los Angeles (1999). At the turn of the millennium, it seemed like they would show no signs of relenting, balancing sales and chart success with headline-grabbing demonstrations (like shutting down the New York Stock Exchange for a video shoot). However, in late 2000, the band imploded and decided to take a break. After issuing a covers album, Renegades, members went on to pursue other projects, with vocalist Zack de la Rocha going solo and the rest of the group forming Audioslave with Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell. Into the 2010s, a rumored comeback album never materialized, but the band remained a fixture on the cultural landscape, performing shows and working on side projects such as Prophets of Rage. At the turn of the next decade, Rage made another official comeback, charting a global reunion tour in 2020 that was sidelined by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. That same year, in the midst of international protests against police brutality, their seminal debut struck a chord with demonstrators, reentering the U.S. charts as every one of their albums hit the Top 30 on streaming services.Taking aim at corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression, Rage Against the Machine formed in Los Angeles in the early \\'90s out of the wreckage of a number of local groups: vocalist Zack de la Rocha (the son of Chicano political artist Robert de la Rocha) emerged from the bands Headstance, Farside, and Inside Out; guitarist Tom Morello (the nephew of Jomo Kenyatta, the first Kenyan president) originated in Lock Up; and drummer Brad Wilk played with future Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder. Rounded out by bassist Tim Commerford, a childhood friend of de la Rocha\\'s, Rage debuted in 1992 with a self-released, self-titled 12-song cassette featuring the song \"Bullet in the Head,\" which became a hit when reissued as a single later in the year. The tape won the band a deal with Epic, and their leap to the majors did not go unnoticed by detractors, who questioned the revolutionary integrity of Rage Against the Machine\\'s decision to align itself with the label\\'s parent company, media behemoth Sony.Undeterred, the quartet made their official major-label debut with Rage Against the Machine, scoring hits with singles like \"Killing in the Name\" and \"Bombtrack.\" After touring with Lollapalooza and declaring their support of groups like FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), Rock for Choice, and Refuse &amp; Resist, Rage spent a reportedly tumultuous four years working on their follow-up. Despite rumors of a breakup, they returned in 1996 with Evil Empire, which entered the U.S. album charts at number one and scored a hit single with \"Bulls on Parade.\" The track \"Tire Me\" went on to win a Grammy for Best Metal Performance. In 1997, the band charted a summer tour with rap group Wu-Tang Clan (the Wu later dropped off the tour and the Roots replaced them) and remained active in support of various leftist political causes, including a controversial 1999 benefit concert for death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. Third album The Battle of Los Angeles followed in 1999, also debuting at number one and going double platinum by the following summer. Album single \"Guerrilla Radio\" scored Rage a second Grammy, this time for Best Hard Rock Performance. A live set from the era -- The Battle of Mexico City -- was recorded for a documentary of the same name and released in 2001 (it finally appeared on vinyl on its 20th anniversary in 2021).In early 2000, de la Rocha announced plans for a solo project and the band performed an incendiary show outside the Democratic National Convention in August (and months later stirred things up outside the Republican National Convention). In between, bassist Commerford was arrested for disorderly conduct at MTV\\'s Video Music Awards following his bizarre disruption of a Limp Bizkit acceptance speech. Plans for a live album were announced shortly thereafter, but in October, de la Rocha abruptly announced his departure from the band, citing breakdowns in communication and group decision-making. Surprised but not angry, the remainder of Rage announced plans to continue with a new vocalist, while de la Rocha refocused on his solo album, which was slated to include collaborations with acclaimed hip-hop artists including DJ Shadow and El-P of Company Flow. December 2000 saw the release of de la Rocha\\'s final studio effort with the band, the Rick Rubin-produced Renegades; it featured nearly a dozen covers of hip-hop, rock, and punk artists like EPMD, Bruce Springsteen, Devo, the Rolling Stones, the MC5, and more. By 2001, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford had formed Audioslave with Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, and the group released an eponymous album by the end of 2002. With a de la Rocha solo album still not announced, Epic finally released the long-promised concert album Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium on CD and DVD in time for Christmas 2003. Over the next few years, rumors of a Rage Against the Machine reunion always swirled but never came to fruition. Two Audioslave albums followed in 2005 and 2006 before the group split, then the next year Morello began releasing protest folk-punk as the Nightwatchman. That year also brought the long-anticipated Rage Against the Machine reunion. First, the band played the closing day of 2007\\'s Coachella festival, then in 2008 several other gigs followed, usually coinciding with major festivals in Europe and the U.S. No new studio work from Rage Against the Machine materialized, but de la Rocha collaborated with former Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore in a group called One Day as a Lion, releasing an EP that year.The next burst of Rage activity came in 2009 when there was an Internet campaign to get \"Killing in the Name\" to the top of the U.K. charts, all in the hopes of thwarting an X Factor winner from taking the pole position. The viral campaign worked and Rage played a free celebratory concert at Finsbury Park in the summer of 2010. Despite all these gigs -- including a summer 2011 appearance at L.A. Rising, a festival the band arranged -- and word of a new album, no recordings appeared. In 2013, their debut album received a deluxe reissue and, two years later, the 2010 Finsbury Park gig was issued as a CD/DVD release. The next year, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford joined forces with Public Enemy\\'s Chuck D and Cypress Hill\\'s B Real to form the supergroup Prophets of Rage, releasing a self-titled album in 2017.As 2019 came to a close, Rage kicked off a new decade with more reports of a comeback. Coachella appearances were later confirmed, the start of a global trek that would pair the veteran band with like-minded rap duo (and frequent de la Rocha collaborators) Run the Jewels. However, plans were halted by March, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced cancellations of most live music for 2020. That June, as protests against police brutality broke out around the world following the death of George Floyd, Rage\\'s albums returned to Billboard and streaming charts. ~ Neil Z.

      "'U2 catapulted over its post-punk peers to become the biggest rock &amp; roll band in the world, a title they earned after the release of The Joshua Tree in 1987 and maintained well into the 21st century. Alone among all the groups to emerge from the post-punk era, U2 channeled their yen for moody, experimental aural textures into clearly defined rock anthems and ballads -- songs that sounded majestic yet felt personal. Much of that sense of intimacy can be attributed to Bono, a lead singer who gravitates toward grand gestures yet remains grounded by his belief in humanity and the revolutionary power of rock &amp; roll. This sense of righteousness never left U2, not even after the group sold millions of albums all over the globe, but it burned brightest on their earliest records such as 1983\\'s galvanizing War, when the cavernous guitar of the Edge still seemed flinty and the rhythm section of Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton conveyed the grit of the group\\'s punk beginnings. This phase of U2 crested around the time they stole the show at Live Aid in 1985, an event that laid the groundwork for The Joshua Tree. Powered by the twin Billboard chart-toppers \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking For,\" The Joshua Tree contained the group\\'s most direct music to date, yet that immediacy was countered by evocative, noir-ish production, setting a precedent U2 would follow for the rest of their career; whenever they got too close to the middle of the road, they darted in another direction. Their first -- and most radical -- reinvention arrived in 1991, with the dense, electronics-drenched Achtung Baby, a left turn that set the pace for a decade of risk-taking that culminated with 1997\\'s Pop, a rare commercial misfire from the band. U2 righted themselves with 2000\\'s All That You Can\\'t Leave Behind, a streamlined back-to-basics album that brought them to a cruising altitude they maintained through the 2000s, as they released albums like How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and No Line on the Horizon that kept them at the forefront of mainstream rock. U2\\'s desire to play to every imaginable audience backfired when their 2014 album Songs of Innocence was downloaded to the library of every iTunes user, generating bad publicity that pushed them toward the reflective territory of 2017\\'s Songs of Experience and Songs of Surrender, a 2023 album that found them reinterpreting 40 songs from their catalog. The band\\'s sound was undeniably indebted to post-punk, so it\\'s mildly ironic that U2 formed in 1976, before punk had even reached their hometown of Dublin, Ireland. Larry Mullen, Jr. posted a notice on a high school bulletin board asking for fellow musicians to form a band. Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton, and Dick Evans responded to the ad, and the teenagers got together as a Beatles and Stones cover band called the Feedback. They then changed their name to the Hype in 1977. Shortly afterward, Dick Evans left the band to form the Virgin Prunes, and they changed names once again, this time adopting the moniker of U2.U2\\'s first big break arrived in 1978, during the members\\' final year of high school when they won a talent contest sponsored by Guinness. By the end of the year, the Stranglers\\' manager, Paul McGuinness, had seen U2 play and offered to manage them. Even with a powerful manager in their corner, the band had trouble making much headway, and failed an audition with CBS Records at the end of the year. In the fall of 1979, U2 released their debut EP, U2 Three. The EP was available only in Ireland, where it topped the national charts. Shortly afterward, they began to play in England, but they failed to gain much attention away from home.U2 scored one more chart-topping single, \"Another Day,\" in early 1980 before Island Records offered the group a contract. Later that year, the band\\'s full-length debut, Boy, was released. Produced by Steve Lillywhite, the album\\'s sweeping, atmospheric but edgy sound was unlike most recordings by U2\\'s post-punk contemporaries, and the band earned further attention for its public embrace of Christianity; only Clayton was not a practicing Christian. Through constant touring, including opening gigs for Talking Heads, U2 were able to take Boy into the American Top 70 in early 1981. October, also produced by Lillywhite, followed in the fall, and it became their British breakthrough, reaching number 11 on the charts. By early 1983, Boy\\'s \"I Will Follow\" and October\\'s \"Gloria\" had become staples on MTV, which, along with their touring, gave U2 a formidable cult following in the U.S. Released in the spring of 1983, the Lillywhite-produced War became U2\\'s breakthrough release, entering the U.K. charts at number one and elevating them into arenas in the United States, where the album peaked at number 12. War had a stronger political message than its predecessors, as evidenced by the international hits \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"New Year\\'s Day.\" During the supporting tour, the band filmed its concert at Colorado\\'s Red Rocks Amphitheater, releasing the show as an EP and video titled Under a Blood Red Sky. The EP entered in the U.K. charts at number two, becoming the most successful live recording in British history. U2 had become one of the most popular bands in the world, and their righteous political stance soon became replicated by many other bands, providing the impetus for the Band Aid and Live Aid projects in 1984 and 1985, respectively. For the follow-up to War, U2 entered the studios with co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who helped give the resulting album an experimental, atmospheric tone. Released in the fall of 1984, The Unforgettable Fire replicated the chart status of War, entering the U.K. charts at number one and reaching number 12 in the U.S. The album also generated the group\\'s first Top 40 hit in America with \"(Pride) In the Name of Love,\" a tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. U2 supported the album with a successful international tour, highlighted by a show-stealing performance at Live Aid. Following the tour, the band released the live EP Wide Awake in America in 1985.While U2 had become one of the most successful rock bands of the \\'80s, they didn\\'t truly become superstars until the spring 1987 release of The Joshua Tree. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews, many of which proclaimed the album a masterpiece, The Joshua Tree became U2\\'s first American number one hit and their third straight album to enter the U.K. charts at number one; in England, it set a record by going platinum within 28 hours. Generating the U.S. number one hits \"With or Without You\" and \"I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking For,\" The Joshua Tree and the group\\'s supporting tour became the biggest success story of 1987, earning U2 the cover of respected publications like Time magazine. U2 decided to film a documentary about their American tour, recording new material along the way. The project became Rattle &amp; Hum, a film that was supported by a double-album soundtrack that was divided between live tracks and new material. While the album Rattle &amp; Hum was a hit, the record and film received the weakest reviews of U2\\'s career, with many critics taking issue with the group\\'s fascination with American roots music like blues, soul, country, and folk. Following the release of Rattle &amp; Hum, the band took an extended hiatus.U2 reconvened in Berlin in 1990 to record a new album with Eno and Lanois. While the sessions for the album were difficult, the resulting record, Achtung Baby, represented a successful reinvention of the band\\'s trademark sound. Where they had been inspired by post-punk in their early career and American music during their mid-career, U2 delved into electronic and dance music with Achtung Baby. Inspired equally by late-\\'70s Bowie and the Madchester scene in the U.K., Achtung Baby was sonically more eclectic and adventurous than U2\\'s earlier work, and it didn\\'t alienate their core audience. The album debuted at number one throughout the world and spawned Top Ten hits with \"Mysterious Ways\" and \"One.\" Early in 1992, the group launched an elaborate tour to support Achtung Baby. Dubbed Zoo TV, the tour was an innovative blend of multimedia electronics, featuring a stage filled with televisions, suspended cars, and cellular phones. Bono devised an alter ego called the Fly, which was a knowing send-up of rock stardom. Even under the ironic guise of the Fly and Zoo TV, it was evident that U2 were looser and more fun than ever before, even though they had not abandoned their trademark righteous political anger. Following the completion of the American Zoo TV tour in late 1992 and preceding the launch of the tour\\'s European leg, U2 entered the studio to complete an EP of new material that soon became the full-length Zooropa. Released in the summer of 1993 to coincide with the tour of the same name, Zooropa demonstrated a heavier techno and dance influence than Achtung Baby and received strong reviews. Nevertheless, the album stalled at sales of two million and failed to generate a big hit single. During the subsequent Zooropa tour, the Fly metamorphosed into the demonic MacPhisto, which dominated the remainder of the tour. Upon the completion of the Zooropa tour in late 1993, the band took another extended break.In 1995, U2 re-emerged with \"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,\" a glam rock theme to Batman Forever that was produced by Nellee Hooper (Björk, Soul II Soul). Later that year, they recorded the collaborative album Original Soundtracks, Vol. 1 with Brian Eno, releasing the record under the name the Passengers late in 1995. It was greeted with a muted reception, both critically and commercially. Many hardcore U2 fans (including drummer Larry Mullen, Jr.) were unhappy with the Passengers project, and U2 promised their next album, to be released in the fall of 1996, would be a rock &amp; roll record. The project took longer to complete than usual, ultimately being pushed back to the spring of 1997. During its delay, a few tracks, including the forthcoming first single \"Discotheque,\" were leaked, and it became clear that the new album was going to be heavily influenced by techno, dance, and electronic music. When it was finally released, Pop did indeed bear a heavier dance influence, but it was greeted with strong initial sales and a few positive reviews. Demand for the album lessened in the following months, however, and Pop ultimately became the band\\'s least popular album in over a decade. In late 1998, the group returned with Best of 1980-1990, the first in a series of hits collections issued in conjunction with a reported 50 million dollar agreement with Polygram. Included in the comprehensive track list was a remixed version of \"Sweetest Thing,\" originally released as B-side in 1987, which charted well in multiple countries.Three years after the mediocre response to Pop, U2 teamed up with Eno and Lanois once again to release All That You Can\\'t Leave Behind in fall 2000. The album was heralded as a return to form, melding the band\\'s classic sound with contemporary trends. It topped charts around the world, reached number three in America, earned Grammy Awards for the singles \"Beautiful Day\" and \"Walk On,\" and became the band\\'s biggest-selling record in years. (The Elevation tour that followed also brought U2 a hefty paycheck.) Steve Lillywhite, producer of the early-\\'80s landmarks Boy, October, and War, returned to the helm for U2\\'s next record, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb. Released in November 2004, it hit the top of the Billboard charts and quickly gained platinum status. The album also garnered eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, Rock Album of the Year, and Song of the Year (for \"Sometimes You Can\\'t Make It on Your Own,\" which Bono had written for his father). U2 were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in early 2005 and launched an international tour soon after, selling out arena venues in the U.S. and outdoor stadium shows abroad. The Vertigo Tour became the highest-grossing tour of 2005; by the time the entire tour concluded in late 2006, its gross of $389 million had made it the second most successful tour ever. U2 returned to the drawing board in 2006 by partnering with veteran rock producer Rick Rubin. Two songs from those sessions appeared on the compilation U218 Singles, but the remaining material was ultimately scrapped. The band then turned to longtime friends Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, and Steve Lillywhite, all of whom helped shape the sound of U2\\'s 12th studio effort. Entitled No Line on the Horizon, the album was originally slated to appear in October 2008, although the release date was ultimately pushed back to March 2009. No Line on the Horizon was met with enthusiastic reviews but failed to yield a big radio single; even so, the band embarked on another lucrative tour that summer. A second leg, originally planned for 2010, was postponed when Bono suffered a slipped disc and underwent emergency back surgery. Touring resumed the following year, and the so-called 360 Tour was ultimately named the highest-grossing concert tour in history. Meanwhile, Bono and the Edge also worked on music for the Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, which opened in June 2011. Not long after completing the 360 Tour, U2 turned their attention to recording their 13th album, a process that turned out to be rather complicated. Initially, the group worked with such dance-oriented producers as will.i.am and David Guetta, but as the sessions progressed, the concept of the record changed, as did the producers, with the band trying out Ryan Tedder and Flood before eventually settling in for the long haul with Danger Mouse. The first fruits of these sessions appeared in late 2013, when \"Ordinary Love\" was released as part of the soundtrack to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom; the song was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. The next song up was \"Invisible,\" which appeared to be the opening salvo for a new album as it soundtracked a commercial for Super Bowl XLVIII and the group played it on the inaugural February 17, 2014 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Commercial response to the single was lukewarm and the band retreated into the studio for several more months, unexpectedly emerging with a completed album called Songs of Innocence in September 2014. Available in its first month-and-a-half as a free download, Songs of Innocence saw a physical release in October. Upon that release, it debuted at nine on the Billboard 200, selling 25,000 copies in its first week. U2 toured the album through 2015 and began work on their next album, Songs of Experience, in 2016. They set the album aside in 2017 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of The Joshua Tree by touring that album and releasing a deluxe reissue of the 1987 LP. By late August 2017, the first music from Songs of Experience surfaced via a video of \"The Blackout,\" which was followed in early September by \"You\\'re the Best Thing About Me,\" the first official single from the album. Songs of Experience appeared in December 2017 and the group supported it with an international tour that ran through 2018. The following year, U2 brought their Joshua Tree anniversary tour to Asia. In 2020, the band celebrated the 20th anniversary of All That You Can\\'t Leave Behind with a super deluxe box set containing five CDs\\' worth of music. 2021\\'s \"Your Song Saved My Life,\" from the Sing 2 soundtrack, marked U2\\'s first new music of the decade.The next phase in the band\\'s Songs of... era appeared in early 2023 with Songs of Surrender, a sprawling set of re-recorded, intimate versions of songs chosen from their catalog and divided among the band, with each member choosing ten representative tracks. On the day of release, Bono and the Edge appeared in A Sort of Homecoming, with Dave Letterman, a documentary film set in Dublin that featured unreleased footage, interviews, and a special performance by the pair. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Upon the release of their debut album, Yourself or Someone Like You in the fall of 1996, Matchbox Twenty was pigeonholed as one of the legions of post-grunge guitar bands that roamed the American pop scene in the middle of that decade. After \"Push\" climbed the charts, Yourself or Someone Like You continued to spin off singles well into 1998. By that time, the group\\'s blend of \\'70s arena rock and early-\\'90s American alt-rock -- closer to Pearl Jam and maybe R.E.M. than Nirvana -- had become the sound of mainstream American rock. That transition slipped underneath the radar of many pop music critics and fans. Yourself or Someone Like You sold millions of copies without ever truly dominating the charts -- by 1998, it had gone platinum five times; by 2000, ten times. It didn\\'t top the charts, but it was always around, a staple of modern rock, adult alternative, and Top 40 radio alike. Matchbox Twenty was omnipresent because they managed to blend the structure and sentiment of \\'70s arena rock with \\'90s hard rock, thereby winning a large audience by seeming simultaneously classicist and modern. After consolidating their success with 2000\\'s Mad Season and 2002\\'s More Than You Think You Are, the group entered an extended hiatus while its lead singer Rob Thomas pursued a solo career. They\\'d later reunite in 2012 for North, taking an additional 11 years to deliver Where the Light Goes.The de facto leader of Matchbox Twenty is lead singer and songwriter Rob Thomas. An Army brat born on a military base in Germany, Thomas spent much of his childhood between his mother\\'s house in Florida and his grandmother\\'s place in South Carolina. The stress of constantly moving spilled over into his schoolwork, and he dropped out of high school at the age of 17. He spent some time wandering around the Southeast, singing in a variety of rock bands before he made Orlando, Florida his home base. There he met bassist Brian Yale and drummer Paul Doucette, and the three spent several years drifting through local bands before Matchbox Twenty officially formed. They rounded out the lineup with Adam Gaynor (rhythm guitar, vocals), who had previously worked at the Criteria Recording Studios in Miami, and Kyle Cook (lead guitar), a former student of the Atlanta Institute of Music. The band hooked up with Collective Soul producer Matt Serletic and recorded a batch of demos, which helped them secure gigs throughout the U.S. Soon, the band signed to Lava, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, and recorded their debut, Yourself or Someone Like You, also with Serletic. It was released in October 1996 to little attention, but Matchbox Twenty continued to tour America, cultivating a fan base. They eventually landed their single \"Long Day\" on several influential radio stations, which paved the way for their breakthrough hit, \"Push.\" In spring 1997, \"Push\" began climbing its way to the top of the modern rock charts, as it received heavy airplay from radio and MTV. By the summer, the single was in the modern rock Top Ten, and Yourself or Someone Like You had reached the album Top 40 and gone gold. As it turns out, \"Push\" wasn\\'t the culmination of their work but the beginning of a somewhat surprising success story. Later in 1997, the record picked up momentum, as \"3am\" became a bigger hit than \"Push,\" propelling Yourself or Someone Like You to multi-platinum status. Early in 1998, the group was named Best New Band by Rolling Stone\\'s annual reader\\'s poll -- proof that, even if Matchbox Twenty wasn\\'t winning critics, they were winning over a wide mainstream audience. The band and its debut album continued to sell at a steady pace throughout the year as the singles \"Real World\" and \"Back 2 Good\" joined \"Push\" and \"3am\" as radio favorites. Through it all, Matchbox Twenty stayed on the road, at home and abroad. They did well in foreign territories, including Canada, but they truly connected with Australia, where they went platinum eight times; in neighboring New Zealand, they went quintuple platinum. Matchbox Twenty reserved 1999 as the year to record their eagerly anticipated second album, but they didn\\'t disappear from the spotlight due to the unexpected success of \"Smooth,\" a Santana song co-written and sung by Rob Thomas. \"Smooth\" was one of many songs sung by celebrities on Santana\\'s cameo-studded comeback album Supernatural, but it was the one chosen as the lead single. A wise choice, as it turned out, since it became a true pop phenomenon, topping many radio charts and driving Supernatural to multi-platinum sales and several industry awards. Throughout the second half of 1999, \"Smooth\" was inescapable, as it and Supernatural sat on the top of the pop charts. Its success brought more attention to Matchbox Twenty, and Yourself or Someone Like You rocketed to over ten million copies sold -- which qualified it for the RIAA\\'s Diamond Award, which is only granted to records that have moved over ten million units. On top of that, Thomas was named BMI\\'s 1999 Pop Songwriter of the Year, for \"Smooth\" and his work with Matchbox Twenty. Early in 2000, Thomas won three Grammys for \"Smooth\" -- Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.All of this success happened as Matchbox Twenty were recording their second album, again with producer Matt Serletic. That success raised expectations for the new album, entitled Mad Season, which was released in May 2000. Two years later, the band emerged with their third album, More Than You Think You Are. With this particular record, the band shared songwriting duties as a whole for the first time. Despite, or perhaps because of, the band\\'s success and frequent touring, Matchbox Twenty decided to take a break from recording and in 2005, Thomas released his debut solo album, Something to Be. Featuring a more polished funk- and dance-influenced sound, the album sold well and spawned several hit songs, including \"Lonely No More\" and \"This Is How a Heart Breaks.\" In 2007, the reunited Matchbox Twenty -- with Doucette now on guitar replacing Gaynor, who left the band in 2005, and Push Stars\\' Ryan MacMillan on drums -- delivered the hits collection Exile on Mainstream which included a bonus EP of new tracks. North, the band\\'s fourth studio album and first official release since 2002, arrived in September 2012. Debuting at number one upon its release, North featured the Adult Pop Airplay hits \"She\\'s So Mean\" and \"Overjoyed.\" The group stayed on the road supporting the album through 2013. Kyle Cook split in 2016 but his departure was brief: he returned in 2017 for a co-headlining tour with Counting Crows. The band suffered several canceled tours during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and 2021, but the lack of concerts led them to record a new album. Matchbox Twenty returned with their first new material in 11 years in March of 2023, delivering \"Wild Dogs (Running in a Slow Dream)\" prior to a full-length album called Where the Light Goes in May of that year. It marked the first time Matchbox Twenty didn\\'t collaborate with producer Matt Serletic: instead, Gregg Wattenberg and the band\\'s Doucette and Cook shared the duties. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

For twenty years Powderfinger was the soundtrack to your life. Some may remember the heady days of the early '90s, when they'd play bikie bars for a seedy rider. Others discovered Powderfinger in the sweaty mosh pit at the Big Day Out. Or you may have only found them in their twilight days, farewelling the band alongside thousands of fellow fans on their Sunsets tour. Whichever way you discovered them, Powderfinger burned their name across the Australian music landscape, clocking up 5 number 1 albums, 18 ARIA awards, 3 APRA awards and sales of more than 2.5 million albums.

The ambitious, honest, hard-working Brisbane band consisted of Ian ‘Hoggy' Haug (guitar), John ‘JC' Collins (bass), Bernard Fanning (vocals), Darren ‘Darius' Middleton (guitar) and Jonathon ‘Cogsy' Coghill (drums).

      "'One of the more prominent bands in the new millennium\\'s post-grunge scene, Fuel originally comprised the talents of singer/guitarist Brett Scallions, guitarist Carl Bell, bassist Jeff Abercrombie, and drummer Kevin Miller. The band took shape in Tennessee in 1989, crafting a blend of polished guitars and melodic melancholia, before relocating to Pennsylvania in 1993. While playing gigs on the local nightclub circuit, Fuel made its studio debut with an independently released EP, 1996\\'s Porcelain, which sold over 10,000 copies locally and spawned a hometown radio hit with \"Shimmer.\" Such success brought Fuel to the attention of Sony\\'s 550 imprint, which released the EP Hazelton the following year. The band\\'s full-length debut, Sunburn, followed in 1998. \"Shimmer\" proved to be Fuel\\'s calling card once again, as the kinetic single became a modern rock hit and nearly cracked the Top 40. Additional singles like \"Bittersweet,\" \"Jesus or a Gun,\" and the title track (featured on the Scream 3 soundtrack) also earned airplay, propelling Sunburn to platinum record status. Fuel\\'s second album, Something Like Human, followed two and a half years later and launched the hit \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands),\" which proved to be the band\\'s biggest single to date. The album itself reached number 17 on the Billboard charts; within a year of its release, it had climbed to double platinum status, making Fuel one of the more successful rock acts of the year. Released in 2003, Natural Selection sold 71,000 copies in its opening week thanks to the strident lead single \"Falls on Me.\" The album quickly fell from the charts, however, and following the 2005 release of Best of Fuel, frontman Scallions amicably parted ways with the band. Several months later, Fuel\\'s remaining members watched as American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry performed a solid cover of \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" during the show\\'s fifth season. They offered him the position of Scallions\\' replacement, but Daughtry ultimately turned the gig down, opting to launch a career of his own instead. Undeterred, Fuel enlisted Toryn Green as the band\\'s new singer and began to work on a fourth studio album, Angels &amp; Devils. Meanwhile, ex-Godsmack drummer Tommy Stewart filled in for Kevin Miller during live performances and eventually became a permanent part of the group. Other obligations prevented Stewart from recording during the Angels &amp; Devils sessions, however, and Nine Inch Nails/A Perfect Circle drummer Josh Freese was brought in to temporarily handle percussion duties. Angels &amp; Devils was ultimately released in August 2007. ~ Jason Ankeny &amp; Andrew Leahey, Rovi'\n",

      "'One of the most prominent bands to emerge from the Southern California punk scene, blink-182 gained mainstream success in the early 2000s. Arriving in the wake of the pop-punk explosion set off by Green Day, the trio (whose best-known line-up featured bassist/singer Mark Hoppus, guitarist/singer Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker) gained a large fan base with their hooky, high-energy songs. At a time when competition with teen pop and nu-metal was not unheard of, they broke through with their third album, 1999\\'s Enema of the State, releasing a steady stream of hits bolstered by humorous, tongue-in-cheek music videos that were popular in the waning days of MTV\\'s musical programming. The band\\'s popularity helped propel their follow-up, 2001\\'s Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, to number one on the Billboard 200. Though the pop-punk trend faded, blink-182 have remained chart favorites, scoring six Top Ten Billboard 200 albums, including 2003\\'s blink-182, 2011\\'s Neighborhoods, and 2016\\'s California. Though DeLonge left the band in 2015, he ultimately returned and the reunited trio released the single \"Edging\" in 2022.Blink-182 formed in the suburbs of San Diego around guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Scott Raynor. Originally known as simply Blink, the band debuted in 1993 with the self-released EP Fly Swatter. After releasing the album Buddha in 1994, the trio signed to Grilled Cheese/Cargo and released Cheshire Cat the following year. The threat of a lawsuit from a similarly named Irish band forced them to change their name to blink-182, but that did not slow them down: the group earned a higher profile by touring the world with Pennywise and NOFX on the 1996-1997 Warped Tour, in addition to appearing on innumerable skate/surf/snowboarding videos.The third blink-182 LP, Dude Ranch, was jointly released in 1997 by Cargo and MCA. Dude Ranch expanded the group\\'s audience and went platinum by the end of 1998, due in part to the popularity of the infectious teen anthem \"Dammit (Growing Up).\" The group also officially signed with MCA, which released the band\\'s fourth album, Enema of the State, in the summer of 1999. The album, produced by Jerry Finn (Green Day, Rancid), also welcomed a new member into the trio\\'s ranks; Travis Barker, formerly with the Aquabats, settled in on drums after Raynor left midway through a 1998 U.S. tour. Enema was greeted with almost immediate success, and helped the band achieve the mainstream status of toilet-humored pop-punk kings that Dude Ranch had only hinted at. Driven by the commercially successful singles \"What\\'s My Age Again?,\" \"All the Small Things,\" and \"Adam\\'s Song,\" music videos for the three songs (whose clips included themes of streaking and boy band spoofs) were MTV smashes as well.After selling over four million copies of Enema of the State, the trio played on with the limited-edition release The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back) in fall 2000. The album featured their radio hits in a live setting, intertwined with their quirky sense of humor as well as the new song \"Man Overboard.\" Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, issued in spring 2001, saw the band return to their SoCal punk roots and became their first number one album in the U.S. Maturity, of a sort, came with 2003\\'s self-titled album, released on Geffen. Not only did the album sport a song (\"All of This\") that featured Robert Smith of the Cure, but \"I Miss You\" also topped the modern rock chart in 2005. In February of 2005, however, popular as ever and seemingly indestructible, blink-182 unexpectedly announced they would be going on an \"indefinite hiatus,\" supposedly to spend more time with their growing families. Asking fans for help in selecting tracks, the group issued Greatest Hits that November. The bandmembers also continued with other projects. Barker -- who had previously released an album with DeLonge as Boxcar Racer -- continued playing with the Transplants and running his clothing company, Famous Stars and Straps. His family was also spotlighted in the MTV reality show Meet the Barkers. Hoppus carried on with his Atticus fashion venture and began producing -- starting with Motion City Soundtrack\\'s Commit This to Memory -- and hosting his own podcasts. He further began work with Barker in a new band, Plus 44. DeLonge also continued work with his lifestyle clothing company Macbeth, and formally announced his new project, Angels and Airwaves, that fall.While still on hiatus in 2008, the group endured a handful of personal setbacks including the death of longtime producer Jerry Finn, who suffered a brain hemorrhage and subsequent heart attack; he was eventually taken off life support and passed away that August. In September, both Barker and frequent collaborator DJ AM were seriously injured in a plane crash in which both pilots and two of Barker\\'s associates died. It ultimately took 11 months for Barker to fully recover from his injuries and led to the drummer suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The crash prompted Hoppus and DeLonge to reconnect with Barker in support of his recovery, and in 2009, blink-182 announced that they were reuniting, hitting the road with Weezer for their reunion tour. They went into the studio later that year and began laying down the groundwork for a new album, which would be plagued by delays until 2011, when they were eventually able to release their sixth studio effort, Neighborhoods. Despite growing evidence of friction within the band, blink-182 toured throughout much of the rest of 2011, joining My Chemical Romance, Rancid, and Against Me! on the tenth annual Honda Civic Tour. A 20th anniversary tour found the group members appearing together again in 2012. Later that year, blink-182 parted with Interscope, a transition they marked by the release of their self-produced Dogs Eating Dogs EP. Following a string of sold-out dates in Los Angeles in 2013, as well as headlining appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2014, blink-182 began discussions concerning a follow-up to Neighborhoods. However, in January 2015, Hoppus and Barker were quoted in Rolling Stone saying that DeLonge had left the band and announcing the possibility that Alkaline Trio\\'s Matt Skiba would fill in for the guitarist at future shows. DeLonge quickly responded on Facebook that he had not quit blink-182, and that any decision for the band to move forward was made without him. In the end, Skiba officially joined blink-182 and the band entered the studio at the end of the year to begin recording new songs. The first taste from the new trio was \"Bored to Death,\" which was released in April 2016. Their seventh LP, California, was released that summer and debuted at number one, just before they embarked on a tour featuring All Time Low, A Day to Remember, and All-American Rejects. That same year, blink-182 also released the career-spanning vinyl anthology Box Set, which featured all six of the band\\'s studio albums prior to California.The group returned to the studio to begin recording a follow-up and, in the years between blink releases, tended to their other musical responsibilities. Skiba recorded another album with Alkaline Trio, while Barker added numerous collaborations to his ever-expanding résumé, including work with Yungblud, Machine Gun Kelly, XXXTentacion, and others. Meanwhile, Hoppus debuted Simple Creatures, his side project with All Time Low\\'s Alex Gaskarth, and released a pair of EPs. In 2019, blink-182 delivered their aptly titled ninth set (according to Barker and Hoppus), Nine. Despite a bright and colorful album cover, Nine featured dark lyrical content stemming from Hoppus\\' struggles with depression. The LP included singles \"Blame It on My Youth\" and \"Happy Days.\" A standalone single, \"Quarantine,\" appeared in 2020. In June 2021, Hoppus revealed he had been diagnosed with lymphoma and already begun treatment. Later that year, he was declared cancer-free. In the wake of his recovery, it was also revealed that DeLonge had joined the band with a possible studio album and tour featuring the classic blink-182 line-up already in the works. In October 2022, the reunited trio released the Barker-produced \"Edging,\" the first song to feature DeLonge since 2012. ~ John Bush &amp; Corey Apar, Rovi'\n",

      "\"After more than three decades as the lead singer and guitarist for Barenaked Ladies, Ed Robertson has a routine when it comes time to start writing songs for a new album. “I tend to get ideas while I'm driving up to my lake house,” he says. “I record voice memos along the way, and then I listen back and try to make sense of them and mix and match the various ideas I've come up with. On a typical drive, I'm happy if I get six or seven—eight ideas would be a good drive. “For this album,” he continues, “on my first writing trip I had 21 different song ideas. I thought, ‘Wow, this is really cool.' Then I sat down to write, and I thought if I could finish one of them—get the verses, get the bridge, get the chorus in one day—then I'll know this whole writing period is going to be good. And I finished eight songs. I sat down at 10 in the morning, and I looked up at 9:30 and I hadn't eaten, I hadn't moved from the writing table. It was exciting. I've never felt that before.” The results mark a new chapter for a band that's sold more than 15 million albums, earned Grammy nominations and won multiple Juno Awards, and in 2018, were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. In Flight, BNL's eighteenth studio album, retains the dry wit and keen observation we expect from Robertson, bassist Jim Creeggan, keyboardist/guitarist Kevin Hearn and drummer Tyler Stewart, but adds a strong sense of maturing and lessons learned.\"\n",

      "'Queens of the Stone Age emerged from the stoner rock underground of the 1990s to become one of the leading heavy rock bands of the 21st century, a transition sparked by the release of their major-label debut, Rated R, in 2000. A murky immersion in chemical excess, the album showcased QOTSA\\'s skill in wedding thick, grimy guitars with shape-shifting psychedelia, a blend suited for the desert leader Josh Homme called home. Over the years, Homme remained the constant in QOTSA\\'s mercurial lineup, anchoring the group as members and guests cycled through the studio and stage. Dave Grohl\\'s presence on the drumkit on 2022\\'s Songs for the Deaf helped break the band to a wider audience in America, placing them at the vanguard of hard rock music. QOTSA\\'s membership stabilized around the release of …Like Clockwork, the 2013 record that returned them to indie status while giving them their first number one album on the Billboard charts. Homme maintained the same quintet through the Mark Ronson-produced Villains and In Times New Roman..., a 2023 album that found them discovering new shades and textures within their palette. Queens of the Stone Age has its roots in Kyuss, the stoner rock band Josh Homme led during the early \\'90s. After Kyuss split in 1995, Homme served as a supporting guitarist on a Screaming Trees tour, then decided to launch a new band called Gamma Ray. An eponymous EP appeared in 1996 before a German metal band named Gamma Ray threatened legal action over the appellation. Taking a cue from a nickname bestowed on the group by producer Chris Goss, Homme decided to rename his fledgling unit Queens of the Stone Age, unveiling this moniker on the Roadrunner various-artists compilation Burn One Up! Music for Stoners in 1997. Later that year, the split EP Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age -- comprised of old tunes from the latter and new material from the former -- confirmed the transition between Homme\\'s two groups.Homme co-produced Queens of the Stone Age\\'s eponymous 1998 debut with Joe Barresi, which was released on Loosegroove, the indie imprint from Pearl Jam\\'s Stone Gossard and Regan Hagar. With Alfredo Hernandez on drums, Homme played all the guitars and most of the bass and keyboards on the record, but he soon expanded QOTSA into a touring outfit featuring former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri along with guitarist Dave Catching; the latter played on the first volume of Homme\\'s shape-shifting collaborative project the Desert Sessions, which appeared in 1997. This group was by no means secure. By the time QOTSA entered the studio to record their major-label debut Rated R, Hernandez was no longer with the band; Nick Lucero and Gene Trautmann split drumming duties on the record.Co-produced by Homme and Goss and released on Interscope, Rated R built QOTSA\\'s audience exponentially. \"The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret\" gave the band a Top 40 hit in the U.K. Live spots at Ozzfest and with Foo Fighters and Hole helped broaden their following, while events like Oliveri getting arrested after performing nude at the 2001 Rock in Rio Festival helped generate headlines. All this buzz culminated in Foo Fighters leader -- and former Nirvana drummer -- Dave Grohl becoming a temporary member of QOTSA for 2002\\'s Songs for the Deaf and its 2022 supporting tour, which featured Homme, Oliveri, Grohl, ex-Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan, and A Perfect Circle guitarist/keyboardist Troy Van Leeuwen. With its singles \"No One Knows\" and \"Go with the Flow,\" Songs for the Deaf elevated Queens of the Stone Age into the upper ranks of modern rock acts, acting as a heavy, trippy counterpart to the prevailing neo-garage rock of the early 2000s. Grohl decamped at the conclusion of the Songs for the Deaf tour, returning to his regular gig in Foo Fighters; he was replaced by Joey Castillo, who previously drummed with Danzig. In the wake of QOTSA\\'s success, Homme embraced a variety of outside gigs, including playing on a pair of Mark Lanegan albums and collaborating with Jesse Hughes on Peace, Love, Death Metal, the first album by their band Eagles of Death Metal. When it came time to reconvene QOTSA for a sequel to Songs for the Deaf, the band no longer featured Nick Oliveri; Homme fired him due to issues in the bassist\\'s personal life. With Alain Johannes taking over for Oliveri, the group finished recording Lullabies to Paralyze, making space for guest appearances by ZZ Top\\'s Billy Gibbons and Shirley Manson. Preceded by the single \"Little Sister,\" Lullabies to Paralyze appeared in March 2005, followed by a supporting tour that occasionally featured Lanegan in his last live outings with the band. Chris Goss returned to co-produce 2007\\'s Era Vulgaris alongside Homme. Featuring fewer guests than usual -- Julian Casablancas of the Strokes appeared on the single \"Sick, Sick Sick,\" Lanegan provided vocals on one track -- Era Vulgaris appeared in June 2007, wrapping up the band\\'s contract with Interscope. After a supporting tour featuring bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist Dean Fertita -- the pair would become steady members of QOTSA from this point forward -- the band went into a period of inactivity as Homme pursued other projects over the next few years. Chief among these was Them Crooked Vultures, a power trio also featuring Dave Grohl and Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, who released an eponymous album in 2009. The next year saw a deluxe reissue of Rated R and in 2011, the band reissued their hard-to-find debut and did a small supporting tour behind this deluxe edition. Queens of the Stone Age began recording a new album in 2012, transitioning from drummer Joey Castillo to his replacement Jon Theodore during the sessions. The record found QOTSA bringing Grohl back into the fold while also finding spots for Mark Lanegan, Trent Reznor, Alex Turner, Jake Shears, and Elton John, as well as Nick Oliveri for his first spot on a QOTSA album in a decade. With the finished album in hand, Queens of the Stone Age signed with Matador in 2013 and the ensuing ...Like Clockwork album was released in June of that year. Supported by the singles \"My God Is the Sun\" and \"I Sat by the Ocean,\" ...Like Clockwork topped the Billboard 200, as well as the Alternative, Digital, Hard Rock, Independent, and Top Rock charts. Following the success of ...Like Clockwork, Homme and various Queens\\' members participated in the Sound City documentary project and Iggy Pop\\'s 2016 Post Pop Depression album and tour. For Villains, the band\\'s seventh album, QOTSA worked with Mark Ronson and invited Nikka Costa and Matt Sweeney into the studio as guests. Featuring the singles \"The Way You Used to Do\" and \"The Evil Has Landed,\" Villains debuted at three on the Billboard charts upon its August 2017 release.After the Villains tour, Queens of the Stone Age took an extended hiatus, reemerging in June 2023 with In Times New Roman…, their third album for Matador. It was the first QOTSA album to be produced by the band and to not feature any guests. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'With the return of the punks in the mid-\\'90s came a resurgence of their slightly more commercial rivals, new wave bands. No Doubt found a niche as a new wave/ska act, on the strength of vocalist Gwen Stefani\\'s persona -- alternately an embrace of little-girl-lost innocence and riot grrrl feminism -- exemplified on the band\\'s break-out single, \"Just a Girl.\"Formed in 1986 as a ska band inspired by Madness, the lineup of No Doubt initially comprised John Spence, Gwen Stefani, and her brother, Eric. While playing the party-band circuit around Anaheim, the trio picked up bassist Tony Kanal, born in India but raised in Great Britain and the U.S. Hardened by the suicide of Spence in December 1987, No Doubt nevertheless continued; Gwen became the lone vocalist and the group added guitarist Tom Dumont and drummer Adrian Young.No Doubt\\'s live act began to attract regional interest, and Interscope Records signed them in 1991. The band\\'s self-titled debut a year later, an odd fusion of \\'80s pop and ska, sank without a trace in the wake of the grunge movement. As a result, Interscope refused to support No Doubt\\'s tour or further recordings. The band responded by recording on their own during 1993 and 1994; the result was the self-released Beacon Street Collection, much rawer and more punk-inspired than the debut. Eric Stefani left just after its release, later working as an animator for The Simpsons.By late 1994, Interscope allowed recordings to resume, and Tragic Kingdom was released in October 1995. The album served as a document of the breakup of Gwen Stefani and Kanal, whose relationship had lasted seven years. Thanks to constant touring and the appearance of \"Just a Girl\" and \"Spiderwebs\" on MTV\\'s Buzz Bin, the album hit the Top Ten in 1996. Stefani, who has made no secret of her pop ambitions, became a centerpiece of attention as an alternative to the crop of tough girls prevalent on the charts. By the end of the year, Tragic Kingdom hit number one on the album charts, almost a year after its first release; the record\\'s third single, the ballad \"Don\\'t Speak,\" was the band\\'s biggest hit to date. No Doubt\\'s much-anticipated follow-up, The Return of Saturn, was released in the spring of 2000, and \"Simple Kind of Life\" and \"Ex-Girlfriend\" were both critically successful at the mainstream and college levels. A year later, Stefani also hooked up with rap chanteuse Eve for the single \"Let Me Blow Your Mind\" (it went on to earn a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2002); however, Stefani also joined her band for the release of their fifth album. The ska revival and new wave sounds of Rock Steady were issued hot on the heels of lead single \"Hey Baby\" in December 2001. The album generated several major hits -- the heavy synths of \"Hella Good\" and the seductive reggae of \"Underneath It All\" being the biggest -- and the group continued touring the record over the next couple of years, all leading to the release of the hits collection The Singles 1992-2003 in 2003. The following year, the band took a hiatus of undetermined length as Stefani launched a solo career with 2004\\'s Love.Angel.Music.Baby. This hiatus wound up lasting the better part of a decade, during which Stefani stayed in the spotlight via two hit solo albums (the second, The Sweet Escape, arriving in 2006), while the other bandmembers pursued other projects, the most prominent being Tony Kanal\\'s collaborations with P!nk in 2008. No Doubt eased back into action in 2009 with a reunion tour accompanied by the announcement of an impending new album. That record took a while to complete, but it was finally finished in 2012 and released as Push and Shove that fall. It was preceded by the single \"Settle Down\" and debuted at number three on the Billboard charts. In 2016, as Stefani was in the midst of mounting a comeback with her third solo effort, This Is What the Truth Feels Like, Dumont, Kanal, and Young formed a new band named DREAMCAR with AFI frontman Davey Havok. ~ John Bush, Rovi'\n",

      "'American punk-pop trio Eve 6 released two platinum- and gold-selling albums (Eve 6 and Horrorscope) and scored three Top 40 singles, including the chart-topping \"Inside Out,\" during the late \\'90s and early 2000s. The group disbanded after the release of 2003\\'s It\\'s All in Your Head, but reunited for a series of tours with a new lineup in 2007. They re-formed the original trio in 2012, issuing their long-awaited fourth LP, Speak in Code, though it would be a full ten years before their next LP, 2022\\'s Hyper Relevisation. The band\\'s two founders, guitarist Jon Siebels and bassist/vocalist Max Collins, signed a contract with RCA Records while still attending high school in La Crescenta, a neighborhood in northern Los Angeles. Originally called Eleventeen, the bandmates took three long years -- during which time they added a new drummer, Tony Fagenson -- to prep their debut album. The delay was intentional, as RCA Records had demanded the boys graduate from high school before releasing any material. While waiting to issue an album (which ultimately arrived in 1998), Eve 6 sharpened their act by playing local coffeehouses. \"Inside Out,\" the leadoff single from Eve 6\\'s self-titled debut, became a number one modern rock hit in 1998, ousting the Goo Goo Dolls\\' \"Iris\" from the chart-topping position. \"Leech\" also proved to be a popular single, and Eve 6\\'s record went platinum as a result. Two years later, the band returned with Horrorscope, which went gold on the strength of \"Promise\" and the power ballad \"Here\\'s to the Night,\" which was also a Top 40/MTV smash. Eve 6 toured the globe throughout 2000 and 2001 while writing songs for a third record, It\\'s All in Your Head, which was released in mid-2003. Despite the moderate success of the single \"Think Twice,\" sales for the record never truly took off, and Eve 6 were dropped by RCA Records in March 2004. Shortly thereafter, the members announced their decision to disband, and Eve 6 played their final show in July. Siebels went on to play guitar with Monsters Are Waiting, while Collins and Fagenson resurfaced in mid-2006 with their new band, the Sugi Tap. In 2007, Collins and Fagenson added guitarist Matt Bair and put the Sugi Tap on hold to tour as Eve 6 in 2008. In 2011, with new songs, new management, and with Siebels back on board, the band officially re-formed and signed with Fearless Records. A new album, Speak in Code, produced by Don Gilmore (who produced Eve 6\\'s first two albums), appeared in April 2012. Longtime kit man Tony Fagenson left the fold in 2018, making room for new drummer Ben Hilzinger (Beautiful Ben, Unmistakable Stems), who made his studio debut on the 2021 EP Grim Value. Finally, in September 2022, a full decade after their last album, Eve 6 issued their fifth full-length, Hyper Relevisation. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Steve Leggett, Rovi'\n",

      "'Combining emotional melodies and upbeat rhythms moving at an unpredictable rate, At the Drive-In definitely stuck out in their hometown of El Paso, Texas. Formed in early 1994, the group debuted soon after with its first EP, Hell Paso, followed by a brief tour across the Lone Star State. With a lineup secured by Cedric Bixler (vocals), Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Jim Ward (guitar), Paul Hinojos (bass), and Tony Hajjar (drums), At the Drive-In released a second EP, Alfaro Vive, Carajo!, and toured mostly empty houses and clubs across the western United States. A small gig in Los Angeles -- with an audience consisting of only nine people -- somehow got the attention of Flipside Records, which released the band\\'s first full-length, Acrobatic Tenement, in 1996. With constant energy and a stubborn enthusiasm to continue, At the Drive-In began to develop an audience, helped out by constant touring and word-of-mouth hype. Their 1997 follow-up EP, El Gran Orgo, had more of a melodic bite, but their musical depth and originality remained. In/Casino/Out followed in 1998, and 2000 saw the release of Relationship of Command. In 2001, the band went on indefinite hiatus. Bixler and Rodriguez-Lopez formed the Mars Volta, while Ward, Hajjar, and Hinojos moved on to Sparta. By May 2005 that hiatus looked pretty permanent, with both Sparta and the Volta\\'s careers thriving and At the Drive-In issuing a retrospective compilation. This Station Is Non-Operational, released through Fearless domestically, included hits, rarities, cover songs (Smiths, Pink Floyd), and DVD content. In 2012, seemingly out of nowhere, the bandmembers announced that they would be reuniting and performing at the Coachella Festival that April. They went on to perform at a handful of other festivals that year, and reissued their first three albums on their own label, Twenty-First Chapter. In 2013, the Mars Volta dissolved, leaving the band open to a possibility that had been repeatedly shot down: recording new At the Drive-In music. To the delight of their loyal fans, three years later in 2016, the bandmembers announced they were heading back into the studio and would embark on a reunion world tour. However, they would be one man short. In March, mere days before the trek began, Ward announced he was leaving the group. At the end of the year, At the Drive-In returned with the single \"Governed by Contagions.\" Months later, they revealed the title of their fourth album, in•ter a•li•a (Rise Records). Due to Ward not featuring on the release, the group recruited the talents of former Sparta guitarist Keeley Davis to contribute. The record arrived in May 2017 and featured \"Governed by Contagions\" and \"Incurably Innocent\" as lead singles. Later that year, in the midst of touring, they issued their fifth EP, Diamanté. ~ Mike DaRonco, Rovi'\n",

      "'One of the most celebrated British guitar heroes to emerge in the late 1970s and \\'80s, Mark Knopfler first rose to fame as the leader of Dire Straits, where his songwriting and incisive guitar work played a decisive role in making them an international success story. Landing major chart hits on both sides of the Atlantic with songs like 1978\\'s \"Sultans of Swing\" and 1985\\'s \"Money for Nothing\" (the latter anchoring their landmark 1985 album Brothers in Arms), Knopfler\\'s dry wit and smooth, earthy guitar style helped Dire Straits cut a unique throughline that somehow traversed both the more traditional pub rock style of the \\'70s and the excess of the MTV era. Meanwhile, he began to accumulate an impressive résumé as a producer, sideman, songwriter, and film composer in the \\'80s, eventually moving on to a successful career as a solo artist in which he continued to explore his interest in country, Americana, and roots music. With albums like 2004\\'s Shangri-La, the 2006 Emmylou Harris duets album All the Roadrunning, and 2012\\'s Privateering, Knopfler established himself as an organically rooted solo act and collaborator with a widespread global audience. Mark Freuder Knopfler was born in Glasgow, Scotland on August 12, 1949. His father, a Hungarian émigré, worked as an architect, while his mother, of English heritage, was a schoolteacher. The Knopfler family moved to England when Mark was seven, settling in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, and he developed a passion for music while spending time with his uncle; as he told journalist Dan Forte, \"I heard my Uncle Kingsley playing boogie-woogie on the piano when I was about eight or nine, and I thought that those three chords were the most magnificent things in the world -- still do.\" A few years later, Knopfler began learning to play guitar, first on an inexpensive Hofner model before moving up to a Fender electric his father bought for him. At 16, Knopfler and some pals cut a demo single that was never released, and he performed in a vocal group that was successful enough to merit an appearance on local television. In 1967, Knopfler enrolled at Harlow Technical College, where he studied journalism, and a year later he landed a job at the Yorkshire Evening Post, where he wrote news stories and music criticism. After two years at the Post, Knopfler opted to return to school, studying English at Leeds University. While at Leeds, he became friends with a fellow guitarist named Steve Phillips, and they began playing out under the name the Duolian String Pickers; while working with Phillips, Knopfler began developing the fingerpicking style that would become his trademark. After graduating from Leeds in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a pub rock band called Brewer\\'s Droop, featuring drummer Pick Withers. Knopfler\\'s tenure with the band was short-lived, and he took a position as a lecturer at Essex\\'s Loughton College. Knopfler became friends with a handful of local musicians, and they formed a new band called the Café Racers. Mark\\'s brother, David Knopfler, who was also a guitarist and songwriter, introduced Mark to a fellow musician John Illsley, who played guitar but was also a solid bassist. When the Café Racers found themselves in need of a bass player one night, Mark asked Illsley to sit in, and before long, Mark, David, and John were sharing an apartment and working on songs, with Mark on lead guitar, David on rhythm, and John on bass. Mark invited Pick Withers to play drums with the new combo, and while they played their first few gigs as the Café Racers, before long they adopted a new name coined by Withers: Dire Straits. After cutting a demo tape, Dire Straits found a champion in BBC disc jockey Charlie Gillett, who began playing their demo on his show, attracting the attention of manager Ed Bicknell and Polygram A&amp;R man John Stainze. Bicknell took Dire Straits under his wing and Stainze signed the group to Polygram\\'s progressive and hard rock subsidiary Vertigo Records; Warner Bros. picked up the band for U.S. distribution. Dire Straits\\' self-titled debut album was released in the fall of 1978, and the song \"Sultans of Swing\" became a surprise hit single in both America and the U.K.; the album followed it into the charts, as the group\\'s clean, expert playing, and Knopfler\\'s deft lead guitars, Dylanesque vocals, and evocative songs won the band airplay on pop and classic rock playlists. It was the first of a long string of successes for Dire Straits, and while the lineup would shift frequently over the group\\'s lifespan -- Mark Knopfler and John Illsley would prove to be the group\\'s only constants -- between 1978 and 1995 the group was a top concert draw and a frequent presence on radio and record charts; their landmark 1985 album Brothers in Arms sold over nine million copies in the United States alone, and was the top-selling CD of the \\'80s in the U.K.It wasn\\'t long after Dire Straits made their commercial breakthrough that Knopfler began expanding his creative boundaries. In 1979, he was invited to play lead guitar on Bob Dylan\\'s album Slow Train Coming, and in 1983, he produced Dylan\\'s Infidels, as well as leading the backing band. In addition to producing much of Dire Straits\\' catalog, Knopfler was behind the controls for albums by Aztec Camera, Randy Newman, and Willy DeVille. Knopfler lent his talents as a session guitarist to an impressive and diverse range of artists, including Van Morrison, Phil Lynott, Steely Dan, Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, Cliff Richard, and Scott Walker. He also penned the song \"Private Dancer\" for Tina Turner\\'s triumphant comeback album of the same name, and found his songs being covered by the Shadows, whose legendary guitarist Hank Marvin was one of Knopfler\\'s first inspirations. In 1983, Knopfler added \"film composer\" to his résumé when he wrote the score for the Scottish comedy Local Hero; Knopfler\\'s music was cited in many of the film\\'s rave reviews, and he would later score the films Cal, The Princess Bride, Last Exit to Brooklyn, and Wag the Dog, among others. And when Weird Al Yankovic asked Knopfler\\'s permission to record a parody of Dire Straits\\' \"Money for Nothing\" for the soundtrack to his film UHF, Knopfler agreed under one condition -- that he be allowed to re-create his guitar parts for Yankovic\\'s version. Weird Al happily acceded to Knopfler\\'s request. After Knopfler made guest appearances on several albums by another of his heroes, Nashville icon Chet Atkins, the two cut a collaborative project in 1990, called Neck &amp; Neck, which was the first non-soundtrack album Knopfler released under his own name. Knopfler also showed off his love of country sounds with his side project, the Notting Hillbillies, which featured Brendan Croker, Guy Fletcher, and Mark\\'s old Duolian String Pickers partner Steve Phillips. In the fall of 1992, Dire Straits played their last concert, a show in Spain on tour in support of On Every Street, and in 1995, Knopfler quietly announced that he\\'d retired the band, feeling they\\'d become too big. Released in 1996, Golden Heart became Knopfler\\'s official solo debut, followed in 2000 by Sailing to Philadelphia, which included guest appearances by Van Morrison, James Taylor, Gillian Welch, and Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The newly prolific Knopfler shortly returned to the studio and released The Ragpicker\\'s Dream in the fall of 2002; a world tour was planned, but after Knopfler was involved in a motorcycle accident that left him with a broken shoulder and collarbone, the dates were canceled. However, he was soon feeling well enough to go back to recording, and issued Shangri-La in 2004, a set recorded at the Malibu compound where the Band recorded and rehearsed in the \\'70s. As Knopfler\\'s taste for rootsy, country-influenced sounds became a growing presence in his solo work, he began working on material with singer Emmylou Harris, and their collaborative album, 2006\\'s All the Roadrunning, was recorded during sessions spread over seven years. Knopfler and Harris toured together in support of the set, and a live album, Real Live Roadrunning, came out later the same year. Knopfler continued to record at a steady pace, releasing Kill to Get Crimson in 2007 and Get Lucky in 2009, while still finding room to contribute to albums by Sonny Landreth, Bill Wyman, Diane Schuur, Bap Kennedy, and America. The year 2012 found Knopfler releasing Privateer, the first double-disc studio set of his career; the album debuted at eight in the U.K. Three years later, he returned with Tracker; the album debuted at three in the U.K. and 14 in the U.S. In 2016, he collaborated with Evelyn Glennie on the soundtrack for Altamira. Released in November 2018, Knopfler\\'s ninth solo album, Down the Road Wherever, covered a wide range of themes and was again co-produced with former Dire Straits bandmate and longtime solo-era collaborator Guy Fletcher. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'Ariana Grande is perhaps the quintessential pop star of the last half of the 2010s, capturing the era\\'s spirit and style. Emerging in 2013 with the hit single \"The Way,\" Grande initially appeared to be the heir to the throne of Mariah Carey, due in part to her powerhouse vocals. With its Babyface production, her debut Yours Truly underscored her debt to \\'90s R&amp;B, but Grande quickly incorporated hip-hop and EDM into her music. \"Problem,\" a 2014 smash duet with Iggy Azalea, was the first indication of her development, an evolution reinforced by the hits \"Bang Bang\" and \"Love Me Harder,\" which featured Jessie J &amp; Nicki Minaj and the Weeknd, respectively. Grande maintained her popularity with 2016\\'s Dangerous Woman, then really hit her stride with 2018\\'s Sweetener and its swift sequel Thank U, Next, whose title track became her first number one pop hit. That achievement was quickly equaled by \"7 Rings,\" a glitzy anthem for the Instagram age that consolidated her stardom and artistry, as well as \"Positions,\" the lead single from 2020\\'s R&amp;B-heavy album of the same name. Grande then racked up two consecutive number ones by featuring on a pair of Weeknd remixes.A native of Boca Raton, Florida, where she was born in 1993 to graphic designer Edward Butera and Joan Grande (the CEO of Hose-McCann Communications), Grande began singing and acting at an early age, appearing in local theater productions. In 2008, when she was 15, she landed the role of Charlotte in the Broadway production of 13; her performance was well-received, and she won a National Youth Theatre Association Award. Following an appearance in the 2010 Desmond Child-written musical Cuba Libre, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television program Victorious. The show ran until 2012, at which time Grande\\'s Cat Valentine was spun off into a show called Sam &amp; Cat, which also starred Jennette McCurdy of iCarly.As she kept herself busy with television, Grande began to pursue a musical career. She frequently made appearances at sporting events and with symphonies, and she made her first appearances on record with the soundtrack to Victorious. In 2011, she released the single \"Put Your Hearts Up,\" which was cut during sessions for a teen-oriented pop album; she later disowned the single due to its kiddie feel. Grande felt much more comfortable with \"The Way,\" her 2013 single featuring Mac Miller. This signaled a mature direction and audiences responded, taking it to the Top Ten in the U.S., where it was eventually certified triple platinum. It was the first single from her 2013 debut, Yours Truly, which also featured hits in \"Baby I\" and \"Right There.\"At the end of the year she released a seasonal EP called Christmas Kisses, but her real efforts went into the recording of her second album, My Everything. Preceded by the single \"Problem\" -- a song that featured a guest spot from Iggy Azalea, the \"It girl\" of the summer of 2014; it peaked at two on the U.S. charts and was certified double platinum -- the album featured a host of different producers, including Max Martin, Shellback, Ryan Tedder, and Benny Blanco. It was released at the end of August 2014, hitting number one on charts across the globe. Subsequent singles featured assists by Zedd (\"Break Free\"), Jessie J &amp; Nicki Minaj (\"Bang Bang\"), and the Weeknd (\"Love Me Harder\"). At one point in 2014, three of her songs were in the Billboard Top Ten at the same time, a feat matched only be Adele. By the time fifth single \"One Last Time\" charted in early 2015, My Everything had sold nearly 600,000 copies. As that album\\'s cycle wound down, Grande guest-starred on Ryan Murphy\\'s campy slasher series Scream Queens and she also recorded another holiday EP, Christmas &amp; Chill. In October 2015, Grande released the single \"Focus,\" which debuted at number seven on the Hot 100 and was certified platinum the following January. That February, she announced her third album, Dangerous Woman, and released the album\\'s title track as a single in March. The song hit number eight on the Hot 100, making Grande the first artist to have the lead single from each of her first three albums debut in the Top Ten. Featuring collaborations with Macy Gray, Future, and Nicki Minaj, the album appeared in May 2016 and debuted at number two. It eventually went platinum, helped by a trio of Top Ten hits and a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. Grande began 2017 by duetting with John Legend on \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the title track for Disney\\'s live-action remake of the 1991 animated classic. She then mounted her Dangerous Woman Tour, performing across North America and Europe during the first half of 2017. Tragedy struck on May 22, 2017, when a suicide bomber attacked Grande\\'s concert at the Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. Grande returned to performing on June 4, when she held a star-studded charity concert called One Love Manchester to aid the victims of the bombing. Following the show, she resumed the Dangerous Woman Tour, which concluded in Hong Kong that September.In April 2018, Grande kicked off promotion for her fourth album, Sweetener, by issuing the single \"No Tears Left to Cry,\" which debuted at number three on the Hot 100. It was followed by \"God Is a Woman\" later that year. Upon its release in August 2018, Sweetener debuted at number one in both the U.S. and U.K. Three months after the release of Sweetener, Grande returned with the non-LP single \"Thank U, Next.\" Quickly becoming an internet sensation, \"Thank U, Next\" shot to number one throughout the world, as did Grande\\'s next single, \"7 Rings.\" Both songs were featured on the full-length album Thank U, Next, which appeared in February 2019. Her fourth U.S. number one, the set also topped the charts in over a dozen countries, further buoyed by third single \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I\\'m Bored.\" Mere months after the release of Thank U, Next, Grande moved on with a series of collaborations, including \"Monopoly\" with Victoria Monet, \"Boyfriend\" with Social House, and the Charlie\\'s Angels reboot theme \"Don\\'t Call Me Angel\" with Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey. Capping off the year, Grande was nominated for five Grammy Awards: Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for Thank U, Next, Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"7 Rings,\" and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Boyfriend.\" She capped this prolific period with k bye for now, a live album recorded at various stops throughout her 2019 Sweetener World Tour.Grande had duets reach the top of the Billboard charts in early 2020 -- first it was \"Stuck with U\" with Justin Bieber, then it was \"Rain on Me\" with Lady Gaga -- before she launched her next album, Positions, with the release of its title track. The single reached number one just before the October 30 release of the album, which crowned the Billboard 200. In 2021, she teamed up with the Weeknd on a remix of his song \"Save Your Tears,\" delivering another chart-topper for both artists. They repeated this same success two years later when Grande appeared on a remix of \"Die For You\" from the Weeknd\\'s Starboy album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'With an eye toward reinventing the boy band sound, the Wanted formed in 2009, nearly ten years after groups like *NSync and the Backstreet Boys hit their commercial peak. Like those two groups, the Wanted were assembled through a series of auditions. Max George, a member of the short-lived British boy band Avenue, was the most famous singer to land a spot in the outfit\\'s lineup, while Siva Kaneswaran became the group\\'s only Irish member. Rounded out by British vocalists Jay McGuiness, Tom Parker, and Nathan Sykes, the Wanted topped the U.K. charts less than 12 months after forming when their debut single, \"All Time Low,\" debuted at number one in August 2010.The band\\'s debut album, The Wanted, followed with similar chart success, debuting at number four on the U.K. album charts upon release in October 2010. One year later, the Wanted returned with their sophomore effort, Battleground, featuring the single \"Gold Forever.\" By the time the album was released, the band had already signed a distribution deal with the American-based Def Jam Records. In 2012, the band released a self-titled compilation EP as an introduction to the U.S. market; it featured hits off its first two albums, as well as two newly recorded songs. The EP was well-received stateside and soon after, they began sessions for their third record, Word of Mouth, which was issued in 2013. It reached Top Ten in the U.K., and the Wanted began a world tour that took them into 2014. The band began to splinter later that year before announcing a hiatus.Following the news, each member focused on their own solo careers, with Sykes delivering his debut album, Unfinished Business, in 2016, George releasing a handful of singles and embarking on a television career, Kaneswaran working behind the scenes in the industry and issuing his own material, McGuiness moving into theatre, and Parker working on solo material and television appearances. By 2020 rumors began circulating of the Wanted\\'s return, but at the end of the year Parker was diagnosed with an inoperable stage four brain tumor. With the COVID-19 pandemic putting a halt to any comeback and Parker receiving treatment for his cancer, the group put everything on hold. In September 2021 Parker organized a concert for the U.K. charity Stand Up to Cancer, with acts such as Becky Hill, McFly, and Liam Payne performing. The show also saw the reunited the Wanted return, performing for the first time since 2014. At the end of 2021 the group issued their first greatest-hits collection. Most Wanted featured a trove of their hit singles alongside newly recorded material especially for the release. Tom Parker died on March 30, 2022 due to complications from glioblastoma. He was 33. ~ Andrew Leahey &amp; Rich Wilson, Rovi'\n",

      "'Debuting in the late \\'90s with a radio-friendly R&amp;B sound similar to a crop of other young performers, singer/songwriter P!nk quickly developed her own identity, transforming pop songcraft and powerhouse, rock-influenced vocals into a winning combination that kept her in the Top Ten for decades. From 2001\\'s quintuple-platinum M!ssundaztood to 2003\\'s Grammy-winning Try This, P!nk steadily made moves away from her early R&amp;B style, teaming with songwriters Linda Perry, Tim Armstrong (Rancid), and Butch Walker to give her rousing pop anthems a distinct rock edge. Nominated for over a dozen Grammy Awards, she won Best Pop Collaboration in 2002 for the hit cover of \"Lady Marmalade\" and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance in 2004 for \"Trouble.\" She also won an Emmy in 2016 for \"Today\\'s the Day,\" the theme to The Ellen DeGeneres Show. In 2019, P!nk issued Hurts 2B Human, which, like her two previous efforts, topped the Billboard 200. Following the 2021 documentary and concert compilation All I Know So Far, she released her ninth album, 2023\\'s Trustfall. With a string of number one singles and millions of albums sold globally, P!nk is one of the most commercially successful pop acts in the world.Born Alecia Beth Moore on September 8, 1979, in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, P!nk received her nickname as a child, years before she dyed her hair accordingly. She grew up in a musical family and was a regular on the Philadelphia club scene by the age of 13, first as a dancer and then as a backing vocalist for the local hip-hop group Schoolz of Thought. At 14, she began writing her own songs; the same year, a local DJ at Club Fever began inviting her onstage to sing a song every Friday.P!nk was spotted one night by an executive for MCA Records, who asked her to audition for an R&amp;B group called Basic Instinct. Although P!nk\\'s strong vocals landed her the gig, the group imploded not long after. She was quickly recruited for a female R&amp;B trio called Choice, who signed to L.A. Reid and Babyface\\'s LaFace label on the strength of their demo; however, they too disbanded due to differences over musical direction. During Choice\\'s brief studio time, producer Daryl Simmons asked P!nk to write a bridge section for the song \"Just to Be Loving You.\" Impressed with the results, P!nk rediscovered her songwriting muse, and an equally impressed L.A. Reid soon gave her a solo deal with LaFace.P!nk recorded her solo debut, Can\\'t Take Me Home, with a variety of songwriting partners and dance-pop and R&amp;B producers. Released in 2000, the album was a double-platinum hit; it spun off three Top Ten singles in \"There U Go,\" \"Most Girls,\" and \"You Make Me Sick.\" She toured that summer as the opening act for *N Sync, but soon found herself tired of being pigeonholed as strictly a teen act despite her sassy, forthright persona. As she set about working on her follow-up album, P!nk took part in the remake of Patti LaBelle\\'s \"Lady Marmalade\" featured on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, which also featured powerhouse divas Christina Aguilera, Mya, and Lil\\' Kim. The Grammy-winning song was a massive hit, topping the charts in both the U.S. and U.K. while expanding P!nk\\'s own audience.Toward the end of the year, P!nk released her next single, \"Get the Party Started,\" which climbed into the Top Five and became the singer\\'s most inescapable hit to date. Her accompanying sophomore album, M!ssundaztood, quickly went double platinum; it boasted a more personal voice and an eclectic sound, plus heavy contributions from ex-4 Non Blondes singer Linda Perry, who helped bring more rock muscle to P!nk\\'s sound (as did guest appearances by Steven Tyler and Richie Sambora). M!ssundaztood attracted positive critical notices as well, and its second single, \"Don\\'t Let Me Get Me,\" became another fast-rising Top Ten hit. P!nk next issued Try This in November 2003. The album continued her progression toward more rock-oriented material, due in part to the songwriting collaboration of Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong on eight of the album\\'s tracks. Try This\\' lead single, \"Trouble,\" cracked the upper regions of Billboard\\'s Top 40 and earned P!nk a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. On the home front, P!nk wed motocross racer Carey Hart -- whom she had initially met at 2001\\'s X Games -- on January 7, 2006, in Costa Rica. Her next album, I\\'m Not Dead, appeared that April; its first single, \"Stupid Girls,\" quickly became a hit, while \"Who Knew\" and \"U + Ur Hand\" both cracked the Top Ten. I\\'m Not Dead reached platinum status in several countries and helped ramp up anticipation of P!nk\\'s follow-up, Funhouse, which arrived in October 2008. \"So What,\" the album\\'s leadoff single, became her first number one hit since \"Lady Marmalade.\" Another single, the double-platinum \"Please Don\\'t Leave Me,\" followed in 2009. All these hits were collected on the 2010 release Greatest Hits...So Far!!!, which featured the previously unreleased single \"Raise Your Glass,\" an uplifting dance anthem that scored P!nk another number one and was later certified quintuple platinum. Around the time of the release of Greatest Hits...So Far!!!, P!nk announced that she and her husband were expecting their first child.In September 2012, P!nk released her sixth studio album, The Truth About Love. With production from Greg Kurstin, Butch Walker, Max Martin, Dan Wilson, and others, it became her first number one album in America and earned platinum status in half a dozen countries. The singles \"Blow Me (One Last Kiss),\" \"Try,\" and \"Just Give Me a Reason\" all hit the Top Ten in the U.S., and the last (a duet with Fun.\\'s Nate Ruess) became her fourth number one hit in America. P!nk mounted a year-long tour -- the third best-selling in 2013, according to Billboard -- through Australia, Europe, and North America, and at the end of 2013, she was named Woman of the Year by Billboard. Taking a break from her solo work, P!nk teamed up with City and Colour vocalist Dallas Green for a collaborative acoustic effort called You+Me. They released their first album, Rose Ave., in October 2014. Rose Ave. debuted atop the Billboard folk chart and cracked the Billboard 200 Top Five. The following year, P!nk wrote a new theme song for The Ellen DeGeneres Show titled \"Today\\'s the Day,\" which won the singer an Emmy. She also contributed \"Just Like Fire,\" a new song, to the 2016 movie Alice Through the Looking Glass. P!nk returned in August 2017 with the socially charged track \"What About Us,\" the first single from her Beautiful Trauma album, which arrived in October. Upon release, the LP topped the Billboard 200 -- her second consecutive number one -- while \"What About Us\" and Beautiful Trauma were both nominated for Grammys. Kicking off her seventh world tour in early 2018, she spent the following year on the road, also contributing to Elton John\\'s Revamp &amp; Restoration project and The Greatest Showman: Reimagined compilation.In April 2019, P!nk released Hurts 2B Human, her third straight Billboard 200-topping album. She teamed up with Keith Urban the following year for the single \"One Too Many,\" and in 2021 she released \"Cover Me in Sunshine,\" a duet with her daughter, Willow Sage Hart. That track landed on All I Know So Far, a live companion to the documentary film of the same name, which was recorded mostly at London\\'s Wembley Stadium in June 2019. The radio hit \"All I Know So Far\" was later nominated for a Grammy Award. In July 2022, she delivered the punk-edged women\\'s rights single \"Irrelevant,\" released in protest of the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s overturning of Roe v. Wade. At the end of 2022, P!nk issued \"Never Gonna Not Dance Again\" as a precursor to her ninth studio album, Trustfall, which arrived in early 2023. The anthemic set featured production by Fred Again, Max Martin, and Shellback, as well as appearances by the Lumineers, First Aid Kit, and Chris Stapleton. ~ Steve Huey &amp; Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'\n",

      "'Poised at the confluence of feel-good rap, pop, and electronic, Flo Rida established himself as the party king of the late 2000s with global smash hits like the T-Pain-assisted \"Low\" and the massive club banger \"Right Round\" featuring Kesha. The Florida-born MC and singer carried his international success into the next decade, further cementing his reputation with 2011\\'s The Wild Ones, an album that yielded four multi-platinum singles including \"Good Feeling,\" \"Whistle,\" and the Sia-assisted title cut. Known for his dynamic rapped/sung attack and larger-than-life personality, Flo Rida has been able to move freely between the rap and pop worlds while also enlisting prominent dance producers like Axwell and Avicii to supercharge his sound. His later output trended exclusively toward singles like the 2016 Jason Derulo collaboration \"Hello Friday\" and 2017\\'s \"Cake\" with 99 Percent. In 2021, he featured on the Eurovision Song Contest entry \"Adrenalina\" by Italian singer Senhit.Born and raised in Carol City, Florida Flo Rida (real name Tramar Lacel Dillard), Flo Rida, then a teenager, toured as a hype man for 2 Live Crew\\'s Fresh Kid Ice and began popping up on high-profile mixtapes by 2006 (most notably on DJ Khaled\\'s \"Bitch I\\'m from Dade County,\" where he joined Rick Ross, Trick Daddy, Trina, and Dre of Cool &amp; Dre). Signed to the Atlantic-distributed Poe Boy that year, he recorded his debut album, Mail on Sunday, which was released in March of 2008. The album\\'s lead single, \"Low\" featuring T-Pain, proved to be the MC\\'s breakout and topped the Billboard Hot 100 for ten weeks. A year later he followed up with the album R.O.O.T.S. (Route of Overcoming the Struggle), which yielded the massive club hit \"Round,\" and introduced the world to Kesha. Only 1 Flo, Pt. 1 appeared in 2010, with some tracks produced by dance music stars like Axwell, Benny Blanco, and David Guetta. On his 2012 release, Wild Ones, productions from Dr. Luke, Avicii, and Axwell continued in this dance direction. The album offered up three big hits: \"Whistle,\" \"Good Feeling,\" and \"Wild Ones,\" featuring Sia. Three years later, Flo Rida reappeared with his fourth EP, 2015\\'s My House, which included the eponymous hit single. During the latter half of the decade, his output consisted largely of singles and collaborations including 2016\\'s \"Hello Friday\" with Jason Derulo, 2017\\'s \"Cake\" featuring 99 Percent, 2018\\'s solo \"Dancer,\" and the 2019 E-40 and Sage the Gemini meetup \"Snack.\" In a somewhat unexpected pairing, Flo Rida joined Italian singer Senhit on \"Adrenalina,\" which served as her entry for the 2021 Eurovision Song Contest representing San Marino. He quickly followed up with his own single, \"Summer\\'s Not Ready,\" featuring Inna and Timmy Trumpet.

      "'Sara Bareilles appeared to be a throwback to another era when she released her debut Little Voice in 2007. Much of this retro vibe rested upon her reliance on audaciously melodic songcraft, a skill showcased on her smash single \"Love Song,\" a tune that managed to spin classic singer/songwriter tropes into the modern era. This facility with the past and flair for the present helped Bareilles become one of the most successful and enduring singer/songwriters of her generation. She racked up her big hits during the late 2000s and 2010s -- \"Love Song\" went to number four, \"King of Anything\" peaked at 32 in 2010, \"Brave\" topped out at 23 in 2013 -- and she turned to Broadway, where she composed the songs for the 2015 musical adaptation of Adrienne Shelly\\'s Waitress. Bareilles found a second home in theater, earning a Tony nomination for her score for 2016\\'s SpongeBob SquarePants, then appearing as Mary Magdalene in NBC\\'s television production of Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert, a role which earned her two Emmy nominations. By this point, she had become part of the show biz firmament, winning a Grammy for \"Saint Honesty\" in 2019, adapting her songbook for the 2020 Apple TV+ television series Little Voice, and earning a Grammy for her 2022 Broadway revival of Into the Woods. Born and raised in Eureka, California, Bareilles grew up participating in choir and local theater, later learning piano while studying at UCLA, where she was enrolled in their Communication Studies program. She spent the majority of her spare time studying her new environment and writing poetry and songs about the busy surroundings.After graduation, she spent the next three years performing her songs at open-mike nights, slowly building her confidence as a musician before graduating to local clubs and festivals. In 2003, she co-produced her first demo, Careful Confessions, and became enthralled with recording techniques. Eager to go back to the studio and create a second full-length album, she started shopping her CD around and signed a deal with Epic Records in April 2005. Producer Eric Rosse took her under his wing the following February and the two spent a little over a year perfecting the orchestration -- nearly half of the songs had formerly appeared on Careful Confessions, and a new batch of tracks was carefully constructed in order to make her first major-label release as strong as possible. The lyrical themes of the album, entitled Little Voice and released in July 2007, covered her past relationships, insecurities, and inner battles with trying to trust her instincts. The single \"Love Song\" made the album a hit; both the single and full-length reached the Top Ten, with \"Love Song\" eventually selling more than three million copies. With a hit album on her hands, Bareilles toured heavily for the next two years, releasing a concert album (Between the Lines: Sara Bareilles Live at the Fillmore) along the way. Playing her songs night after night inspired her to begin writing new material, and she found herself drawn to material that was bigger, bolder, and peppier than the songs that comprised Little Voice. The result was Kaleidoscope Heart, which marked her second major-label effort upon its release in mid-2010. Kaleidoscope Heart debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, beginning a hectic year for Bareilles. She toured the album well into 2011 and in the fall of that year, she signed on to NBC\\'s televised competition The Sing-Off as a judge. After The Sing-Off wrapped up its run in the spring of 2012, Bareilles recorded the Once Upon Another Time EP with her fellow judge Ben Folds acting as producer. She toured semi-regularly throughout 2012 as she prepped a new album. That full-length, her fourth, was called The Blessed Unrest and was released in July 2013. Partially on the strength of the single \"Brave,\" The Blessed Unrest debuted at two on the Billboard Top 200 upon its release, and in the next year it received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year; \"Brave\" also received a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.Following the album cycle for The Blessed Unrest, Bareilles turned her attention toward completing a memoir and writing the music for Diana Paulus\\' Broadway musical adaptation of Adrienne Shelly\\'s 2007 film Waitress. Both projects surfaced in the autumn of 2015. The book, entitled Sounds Like Me, appeared in October, while What\\'s Inside: Songs from Waitress saw release in November. Her ties to Waitress extended into 2017, when Bareilles made her Broadway debut, appearing in the lead role of Jenna Hunterson for a limited ten-week run. She reprised her role in 2018 before starring as Mary Magdalene on a television adaptation titled Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert! She received an Emmy nomination for her role and the set was later nominated for a Grammy. Bareilles returned to her pop career in 2019 with her sixth full-length, Amidst the Chaos, which featured songwriting contributions by Lori McKenna and production by T-Bone Burnett. It reached number six on the U.S. album chart. She won her first Grammy the following year for Best American Roots Performance on \"Saint Honesty,\" a song she had performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live. The 2020 Apple TV+ comedy-drama Little Voice was named after and featured her song of the same name.

The British singer-songwriter dropped his blockbuster sophomore album Fine Line on Columbia Records in December 2019. It combined critical acclaim with record-setting commercial success, debuting at Number One on the Billboard charts. “Watermelon Sugar” became his first Number One single, winning Styles his first Grammy, for Best Pop Solo Performance and a 2021 BRIT Award for Best British Single.

      "'A distinct force in contemporary R&amp;B, SZA has set herself apart with a vulnerable and casually poetic songwriting style and a voice conveying a multitude of emotions with subtle twists and turns. She established herself with a trio of spaced-out EPs and collaborations with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj, and Rihanna, and continued her ascent with Ctrl (2017), a Top Ten album that resulted in five Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist. These accolades proved to be no fluke, as SZA earned almost as many Grammy nominations the next year by assisting Kendrick Lamar with \"All the Stars,\" a Top Ten hit, only one in a slew of platinum singles she has scored as a headliner or featured artist. She racked up five more Top 40 hits before releasing her second album, SOS (2022).Solána Imani Rowe was born in St. Louis and raised in New Jersey, where she excelled in high school gymnastics and cheerleading. After leaving college, Rowe shuffled around different jobs and recorded on the side, influenced by the diverse and maverick likes of Billie Holiday and Björk, as well as Wu-Tang Clan, whose RZA inspired her performing name. She self-released a pair of dreamy and alluring EPs, 2012\\'s See.SZA.Run and 2013\\'s S, and shortly thereafter signed with Top Dawg Entertainment. SZA had been on TDE\\'s radar since 2011, when label co-founder Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson was handed material at the CMJ Music Marathon.Once their agreement was in place, Top Dawg and SZA didn\\'t waste any time. In April 2014, SZA made her label debut with Z, a trippy third EP that entered the Billboard 200 at number 39 with featured appearances from fellow TDE artists Kendrick Lamar and Isaiah Rashad, as well as one from Chance the Rapper. By the end of 2016, SZA was a highly valued collaborator herself. She appeared on high-profile TDE releases from Lamar, Rashad, ScHoolboy Q, and Jay Rock, co-wrote Nicki Minaj\\'s \"Feeling Myself\" and Travis Scott\\'s \"OK Alright,\" and co-wrote and appeared on Rihanna\\'s \"Consideration.\" Primed for the spotlight in 2017, SZA followed through that June with her first album. Released through TDE\\'s arrangement with major-label RCA, the sharply defined Ctrl debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, and on its way to platinum status yielded a pair of multi-platinum singles in \"Love Galore\" and \"The Weekend,\" both of which went Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. SZA also broadened her audience that year with contributions to Maroon 5\\'s Top Ten \"What Lovers Do\" and a remix of Lorde\\'s \"Homemade Dynamite.\" Up for five Grammys, SZA was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Urban Contemporary Album, plus Best R&amp;B Song (\"Supermodel\"), Best R&amp;B Performance (\"The Weekend\"), and Best Rap/Sung Performance (\"Love Galore\"). SZA didn\\'t win in any of the categories, but at the time of the ceremony in January 2019, she was already scaling back up the Hot 100 with \"All the Stars,\" recorded with Kendrick Lamar for Black Panther: The Album. Another multi-platinum hit, the single peaked at number seven and was nominated in four categories -- including Record of the Year and Song of the Year, two of \"the big four\" -- for the next Grammy ceremony. During the rest of 2019, SZA added to her between-albums output, which already included Cardi B\\'s \"I Do,\" with the Game of Thrones commission \"Power Is Power\" and co-starring roles on DJ Khaled\\'s \"Just Us\" and Post Malone\\'s \"Staring at the Sun.\" In 2020, she paired with Justin Timberlake on the song \"The Other Side\" for the Trolls World Tour soundtrack.

      "'A brash and driven, Grammy-nominated pop singer and songwriter, Kesha went straight to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in 2009 with her breakthrough recording, a feature spot on Flo Rida\\'s \"Right Round.\" Her own major-label debut, Animal, followed a year later and made her a bona fide star, showcasing her exuberant electro pop sound and reaching number one in the U.S. and Canada behind the international party-time hit \"TiK ToK.\" The album spawned three more Top Ten singles as well as the Get Sleazy Tour, her first as a headliner. A second solo number one, \"We R Who We R,\" was included on the 2010 EP Cannibal, and she reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 for the third time straight with her second full-length, 2012\\'s Warrior. A more rock-influenced effort, it found space for prior collaborator Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, punk godfather Iggy Pop, and the indie pop band Fun. She had another Hot 100-topping single a year later with \"Timber,\" a collaboration with Pitbull. After a series of legal battles with her longtime producer, Dr. Luke, that involved claims of physical and emotional abuse and business-related mistreatment, Kesha returned with her third album, Rainbow, in 2017. Its themes of self-empowerment hit number one in the U.S., Canada, and across Europe. She again hit the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 with 2020\\'s upbeat High Road and collaborated with producer Rick Rubin on 2023\\'s Gag Order.Kesha Rose Sebert was born in Los Angeles but moved to Nashville when she was four, where her mother -- a longtime songwriter -- had inked a publishing deal. (Over a decade prior to that, Pebe Sebert\\'s biggest success had come with \"Old Flames Can\\'t Hold a Candle to You,\" originally recorded by Joe Sun and later by Dolly Parton.) Before finishing high school, Kesha returned to L.A. for the sake of jump-starting her own music career, despite being set up to study psychology at Columbia. She soon met Dr. Luke, the co-writer and co-producer of Kelly Clarkson\\'s \"Since U Been Gone\" (among several other hits), who was impressed with her demo recordings. Kesha penned the Veronicas\\' \"This Love\" and later contributed background vocals to Britney Spears\\' \"Lace and Leather,\" both of which were released in 2008. The biggest turning point came one year later, when she was tapped to contribute vocals to Flo Rida\\'s Dr. Luke-produced \"Right Round,\" a number one Hot 100 hit.Kesha subsequently signed to RCA, and her debut album Animal -- featuring collaborations with Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Benny Blanco -- was released in early 2010. Animal proved to be a big hit, reaching the top of the Billboard 200 and spinning off the number one single \"TiK ToK.\" The nine-song EP Cannibal appeared at the end of the year. Its single, \"We R Who We R,\" became her second chart-topper, and \"Blow\" also reached the Top Ten. Cannibal was followed in 2011 by another stopgap release, I Am the Dance Commander + I Command You to Dance: The Remix Album. In 2012, she was called upon by rocker Wayne Coyne for The Flaming Lips &amp; Heady Fwends, a collaborative album that partnered Kesha with Biz Markie on the track \"2012 (You Must Be Upgraded).\" Dr. Luke was back on board for her second official album, Warrior, but the more rock-influenced effort also found space for Coyne, punk godfather Iggy Pop, and the indie pop band Fun. Preceded by the Billboard Top Ten single \"Die Young,\" Warrior was released in December 2012 and reached the Top Ten of the albums chart. Two other singles hit the Top 40: \"C\\'Mon\" and \"Crazy Kids.\" Kesha toured North America in 2013 as part of a co-headlining bill with Pitbull, and the duo also recorded a single together, \"Timber,\" which became Kesha\\'s third number one hit.Early in 2014, she entered rehab for treatment of bulimia nervosa, a period that included writing and recording over a dozen songs for her third studio album. That June, she began a stint as a celebrity expert on the ABC singing competition Rising Star alongside Ludacris and Brad Paisley. In late 2014, Kesha sued Dr. Luke for an array of charges, including sexual assault, harassment, emotional abuse, and bad business practices; she also sought release from her contract with Dr. Luke\\'s Kemosabe label. Although the courts initially rejected her claims, wide public support for Kesha caused Kemosabe to release her from her contract in early 2016. Her return to performing came in April 2016, when she took the stage at Coachella to perform \"True Colors\" during Zedd\\'s set. The studio version was released at the end of the month. Following her own world tour in the summer of that year, Kesha returned to the studio to complete work on her long-awaited third LP, Rainbow. \"Praying,\" its lead single, was released in July 2017, with the album arriving a month later; it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. More singles followed, including \"Learn to Grow\" and \"Woman,\" the latter of which hit the top of the U.S. Dance Club Songs chart. In January 2018, Kesha picked up two Grammy nominations, including Best Pop Vocal album for Rainbow, and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Praying.\" Later that year, she released the single \"Here Comes the Change,\" which was used to promote the Ruth Bader Ginsberg biopic On the Basis of Sex. \"Best Day,\" a cut for the Angry Birds 2 movie soundtrack, followed in 2019. A return to the joyful pop of her early career, her fourth studio album High Road arrived in January 2020. Buoyed by the lead single \"Raising Hell,\" featuring Big Freedia, the album debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200. It spawned several more singles, including \"My Own Dance,\" \"Tonight,\" and \"Resentment,\" the latter featuring Brian Wilson, Sturgill Simpson, and Wrabel. The following year, the singer headlined her Kesha Live Tour. She also joined Sam Feldt for his song \"Stronger.\" In May 2023, Kesha returned with her fifth studio album, Gag Order. Largely produced by Rick Rubin, the album found her still dealing with the upheaval of her lawsuit against Dr. Luke and inability to comment publicly on the case. Included on the album were the tracks \"Eat the Acid\" and \"Fine Line,\" which were released in tandem as the lead singles. ~ Rovi Staff, Rovi'\n",

Within five years of his debut, he went from underground genre novelty to certified superstar, amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that combined his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production inspired as much by Tim McGraw as Kanye West. After the release of his 2015 quintuple-platinum single \"White Iverson,\" off his debut, Stoney, he quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers \"Rockstar\" with 21 Savage and \"Psycho\" with Ty Dolla $ign from 2018\\'s Grammy-nominated Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys and one of the highest-certified singles in RIAA history, \"Sunflower\" with Swae Lee, from 2019\\'s pop-leaning Hollywood\\'s Bleeding. After dialing things back with 2022\\'s vulnerable Twelve Carat Toothache, he made a further push into guitar-based pop with 2023\\'s Austin.Raised in Dallas, Austin Post loved a wide range of music from a young age and planned on joining a band thanks to the video game Guitar Hero. When his dad gave him a copy of Terror Squad\\'s hit \"Lean Back,\" though, Post decided to become an MC. He hung out with the Dallas crew the IRAS until a move to the West Coast dropped him in Los Angeles. After putting some braids in his hair, he coined the term \"White Iverson,\" and when he posted the track in early 2015, he hit a million views within a month. Post signed with the Republic label later that year.In 2016, he released the single \"Go Flex\" along with his official debut mixtape, August 26th. Months later, his first studio effort arrived. Stoney featured guests ranging from Justin Bieber to Migos\\' Quavo to Kehlani, peaking at number four on the Billboard 200 and later achieving multi-platinum certification. Following the success of his debut, Post issued the chart-topping singles \"Rockstar\" with 21 Savage and \"Psycho\" with Ty Dolla $ign, which reached a combined total of 13-times platinum. Those hit tracks landed on his sophomore follow-up, Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys, which dealt with his rapid climb to fame and all its trappings. The set reached number one upon release and was later nominated for Album of the Year at the 2019 Grammy Awards. Along with producers Scott Storch, PartyNextDoor, Louis Bell, and London on da Track, the dark, introspective affair also featured guest rappers Nicki Minaj, YG, and G-Eazy, as well as the additional radio hit \"Better Now.\"In between official full-lengths, Post capitalized on his steady ascent in the mainstream, hopping onto the Spider Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack with previous collaborator Swae Lee. Their duet, \"Sunflower,\" topped the charts across the globe and marked a slight pop-smart shift in Post\\'s production (Within a few years, the song was certified over 50 times platinum around the world, becoming one of the biggest songs of the decade). \"Wow,\" \"Goodbyes\" with Young Thug, and \"Circles\" all followed, firmly planting him in the Hot 100\\'s upper reaches for much of 2019. This quartet of hits all appeared on his third effort, Hollywood\\'s Bleeding, which recruited guests Da Baby, Future, Halsey, Meek Mill, Lil Baby, SZA, Travis Scott, and even Ozzy Osbourne. His second number one album, the set topped the Billboard 200 for at least five non-consecutive weeks, the most for any artist that year. While \"Circles\" became his fourth Hot 100 chart-topper at the close of the year, he received a pair of Grammy nominations for that other 2019 number one, \"Sunflower,\" including Record of the Year. Post\\'s 2020 output mainly consisted of guest appearances like Tyla Yaweh\\'s \"Tommy Lee\" and Big Sean\\'s \"Wolves.\" He returned to solo work in 2021 with a cover of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish\\'s \"Only Wanna Be with You\" for the Pokemon 25 album, and his own track, \"Motley Crew.\" The following year, he released his fourth full-length effort, Twelve Carat Toothache, which featured guest spots from Doja Cat, the Kid Laroi, and Fleet Foxes\\' Robin Pecknold. Dealing with the pressures and pitfalls of fame and fortune, the oft-dour set included hit singles \"Cooped Up\" with Roddy Ricch and \"One Right Now\" with the Weeknd. Less than a year later, he issued the hits compilation The Diamond Collection before priming fans with the release of \"Chemical,\" the pop-punk-leaning single from album number five. That set, Austin, fully realized the guitar-based influence that had always bubbled behind Post\\'s most successful mainstream hits (and was seen on full display during his viral 2020 Nirvana tribute set). ~ Neil Z.

      "'One of the most successful acts to come out of the 21st century\\'s English folk-rock revival, Mumford &amp; Sons\\' agreeable fusion of bluegrass, folk, country, and rock found favor with audiences both at home and abroad when they released their debut album, Sigh No More, in 2009. Their chart-topping sophomore effort, 2012\\'s Babel, won Album of the Year at both the Brit and Grammy Awards, which led to the band headlining the 2013 Glastonbury Festival. Mumford &amp; Sons\\' sound evolved with the 2015 arrival of Wilder Mind, which adopted a more stadium-ready alt-rock style, a predilection that the group continued to explore on 2018\\'s Paul Epworth-produced Delta. Formed in 2007 by singer/guitarist/drummer Marcus Mumford, vocalist and banjo/Dobro player Winston Marshall, vocalist/keyboardist Ben Lovett, and vocalist/bassist Ted Dwane, the quartet bonded over their shared love of roots music -- their moniker is meant to invoke the impression of an antiquated family business name. At that time, the West London folk scene was becoming increasingly vibrant with the arrival of fellow new traditionalists like Laura Marling, Noah and the Whale, and Johnny Flynn. In 2008 the band played their first Glastonbury Festival and released their debut EP, Love Your Ground. A 2009 follow-up EP, Cave and the Open Sea, caught the attention Island Records, and more importantly, Arcade Fire producer Markus Dravs, who would go on to helm the band\\'s debut long-player, the Mercury Prize-shortlisted Sigh No More. It was issued a year later in America and Canada on the Glassnote Records label and sold over a million copies between the two countries, earning Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Rock Song. They performed at the ceremony as well, delivering a spirited version of \"The Cave\" and then backed Bob Dylan on a generation-spanning rendition of \"Maggie\\'s Farm.\"Mumford &amp; Sons\\' 2012 Dravs-produced sophomore outing, Babel, debuted at number one on the U.K. Albums Chart and the U.S. Billboard 200, and eventually took home that year\\'s Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Recorded live over two nights at Colorado\\'s legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre, the band\\'s first live film/recording, Road to Red Rocks, followed in late 2012, but after wrapping up their massive international tour in support of Babel, the group members declared that they would be going on an indefinite hiatus. In early 2015, Mumford &amp; Sons announced both a return to the stage and plans to release a new album. The resulting James Ford-produced Wilder Mind, the group\\'s third studio long-player and most stylistically diverse outing to date, arrived in early May of that year, and charted at number one in seven countries. The following year, during their South African tour, they recorded an EP in collaboration with Baaba Maal, the Very Best, and Beatenberg. The resulting Johannesburg, named after the city where it was recorded, featured their Record Store Day 2016 single \"There Will Be Time\" and saw release in June.After returning to the studio with Grammy-winning producer Paul Epworth behind the board, Mumford &amp; Sons emerged in 2018 with their fourth effort, Delta, which marked a return to the folk instrumentation of Sigh No More, but continued to explore radio-ready anthemic adult alternative pop. Two years later, the band issued the Delta Tour EP, a five-song collection of live tracks culled from the previous three years of touring, including a cathartic rendition on Nine Inch Nails\\' \"Hurt.\" ~ James Christopher Monger'\n",

      "'Taylor Swift is that rarest of pop phenomena: a superstar who managed to completely cross over from country to the mainstream. Others have performed similar moves -- notably, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson both became enduring pop culture icons based on their 1970s work -- but Swift shed her country roots like they were a second skin; it was a necessary molting to reveal she was perhaps the sharpest, savviest populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one who could harness the zeitgeist, make it personal and, just as impressively, perform the reverse. These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute \"Tim McGraw,\" but her second album, 2008\\'s Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience. Fearless wound up having considerable legs not only in the U.S., where it racked up six platinum singles on the strength of the Top Ten hits \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me,\" but throughout the world, performing particularly well in the U.K., Canada, and Australia. Speak Now, delivered almost two years later, consolidated that success and moved Swift into the stratosphere of superstardom. Her popularity only increased over her next three albums -- Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017) -- and found her moving assuredly into a pop realm where she already belonged. Even when she scaled back her approach with 2020\\'s stripped-down sibling releases folklore and Evermore, she remained atop the pop world, a position she maintained with re-recordings of her back catalog along with Midnights, a moody album released in 2022.This sense of confidence had been apparent in Taylor Swift since the beginning. The daughter of two bankers -- her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, worked at Merrill Lynch; her mother, Andrea, spent time as a mutual fund marketing executive -- Swift was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, and raised in suburban Wyomissing. She began to show interest in music at the age of nine, and Shania Twain wound up as her biggest formative influence. Swift started to work regularly at local talent contests, eventually winning a chance to open for Charlie Daniels. Soon, she learned how to play guitar and began writing songs, signing a music management deal with Dan Dymtrow; her family relocated to Nashville with the intent of furthering her music career. She was just 14 years old but on the radar of the music industry, signing a development deal with RCA Records in 2004. Swift sharpened her skills with a variety of professional songwriters, forming the strongest connections with Liz Rose. Taylor\\'s original songs earned her a deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing, but not long after that 2004 deal she parted ways with Dymtrow and RCA, all with the intent of launching her recording career now, not later. Things started moving quickly once Swift came to the attention of Scott Borchetta, a former DreamWorks Records exec about to launch Big Machine Records. Borchetta saw Swift perform at a songwriters showcase at the Bluebird Cafe and he signed her to Big Machine in 2005; shortly afterward, she started work on her debut with producer Nathan Chapman, who\\'d previously helmed demos for Taylor. Boasting original song credits on every one of the record\\'s 11 songs (she penned three on her own), Taylor Swift appeared in October 2006 to strong reviews and Swift made sure to work the album hard, appearing at every radio or television event offered and marshaling a burgeoning fan base through the use of MySpace. \"Tim McGraw,\" the first song from the album, did well, but \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" and \"Our Song\" did better on both the pop and country charts, where she racked up five consecutive Top Ten singles. Other successes followed in the wake of the debut -- a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist (she lost to Amy Winehouse), stopgap EPs of Christmas songs -- but Swift concentrated on delivering her sophomore set, Fearless.Appearing in November 2008, Fearless was certified gold by the RIAA in its first week of release, and the record gained momentum throughout 2009, earning several platinum certifications as \"Love Story,\" \"White Horse,\" \"You Belong with Me,\" \"Fifteen,\" and \"Fearless\" all scaled the upper reaches of the country charts while \"You Belong with Me\" nearly topped Billboard\\'s Hot 100. Along with the success came some headlines, first in the form of an infamous appearance at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards where her acceptance speech was interrupted by Kanye West, who burst on-stage to declare that Swift\\'s rival Beyoncé deserved the award more, but her romances also started gaining attention, notably a liaison with Twilight star Taylor Lautner, who appeared with the singer in the 2009 film Valentine\\'s Day. Her flirtation with the silver screen proved brief, as she then poured herself into her third album, Speak Now. Released in October 2010, Speak Now was another massive first-week smash that refused to lose momentum. Hit singles like \"Mine\" and \"Mean,\" which won two Grammy Awards, played a big factor in its success not just on the country charts but on pop radio as well. Following a 2011 live album called World Tour Live: Speak Now, Swift turned toward following a pop path on her fourth album, hiring such mainstream musicians as Dan Wilson, Butch Walker, and Britney Spears producer Max Martin. This mainstream pulse was evident on \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\" the first single from Red. Upon its October 2012 release, Red shattered expectations by selling over a million copies in its first week, a notable achievement that was doubly impressive in an era of declining sales. Once again, Swift\\'s album had legs: it was certified platinum four times in the U.S. and its international sales outstripped those of Speak Now. She supported Red with an international tour in 2013 and more hits came, including \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" and \"22.\"As Swift geared up for the release of her fifth album in 2014, she made it clear that 1989 was designed as her first \"documented, official\" pop album and that there would be no country marketing push for the record. \"Shake It Off,\" an ebullient dance-pop throwback, hit number one upon its August 2014 release. When 1989 appeared in late October 2014, it once again shot to number one and became her third straight album to sell one million copies in its first week (a new record for any artist).Swift gathered many awards during the subsequent year, including Billboard\\'s Woman of the Year, the Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards, and a special 50th Anniversary Milestone Award from the CMAs. Her 1989 World Tour included Asia, North America, and Europe during the last half of 2015, and she won three Grammy Awards at the 2016 ceremonies, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Music Video for \"Bad Blood.\" At the end of 2016, she released \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Forever,\" a duet with ZAYN from the soundtrack for Fifty Shades Darker. The single reached the Top Five across the world. Swift returned with her sixth album, Reputation, in November 2017. Preceded by the number one hit single \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" Reputation debuted at number one, and while it didn\\'t replicate the success of 1989, the album did help underscore her popularity while also pushing her toward mature musicality.Reputation was Swift\\'s final record for Big Machine. In November 2018, she signed with Universal Music Group, which distributed her new albums under its Republic Records banner. The first album in this contract was Lover. Released in August 2019, Lover was preceded by two singles, \"Me!\" and \"You Need to Calm Down,\" which both reached number two on the Hot 100 and helped push the album to number one. The acclaimed LP and two of its singles received a total of three nominations at the 62nd Grammy Awards.Swift\\'s plans to support Lover with a tour in 2020 were scrapped due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With some unexpected time on her hands, she wrote and recorded a new set of songs, many in collaboration with Aaron Dessner of the National; Bon Iver and longtime Swift associate Jack Antonoff also contributed. The resulting album, folklore, was released in July 2020, and went straight to the top of the Billboard 200. Less than five months later, Swift released a companion album to folklore called Evermore. Featuring many of the same collaborators as its predecessor, the Grammy-nominated Evermore debuted at number one upon its December 11, 2020 release. Altogether, the sibling LPs planted Swift atop the U.S. charts for a combined 11 weeks, and folklore became the best-selling album of 2020.In 2021, she began the process of re-recording her back catalog after her Big Machine masters were sold off in 2019, starting with 2008\\'s Fearless. The first of these tracks -- \"Love Story (Taylor\\'s Version)\" -- arrived that February, with Fearless [Taylor\\'s Version] arriving in April. The new version of Fearless contained cameos from Colbie Caillat, Keith Urban, and Maren Morris, along with several previously unheard tunes originally written during the same time period; it debuted at number one on Billboard upon its release. Swift next revisited Red, releasing Red [Taylor\\'s Version] in November 2021. Another chart-topper, this revamp of the 2012 album featured new duets with Phoebe Bridgers, Chris Stapleton, and Ed Sheeran, along with a ten-minute version of the ballad \"All Too Well.\" Another re-recording, \"This Love (Taylor\\'s Version)\" (originally off 1989), arrived in May 2022 and was included in the soundtrack to the coming-of-age drama The Summer I Turned Pretty. At the same time she was revisiting her past work, Swift opened up another chapter in her career with the October 2022 release of Midnights, an album co-produced by Jack Antonoff and featuring a duet with Lana Del Rey on \"Snow on the Beach.\" A moody, electronica-tinged album loosely conceptualized around songs the singer purportedly wrote in the middle of the night, Midnights topped numerous global charts, including the Billboard 200. In late 2022, she also had a supporting role in the David O. Russell film Amsterdam, and sales of her ensuing tour broke the record for the most concert tickets sold in a single day. By early 2023, Swift\\'s career-spanning efforts had converged when she took home the Grammy Award for Best Music Video, Short Film for her ten-minute version of \"All Too Well.\" Soon after, on Valentine\\'s Day, she released Lover Live from Paris, which captured highlights of a September 2019 performance at the Olympia on limited heart-shaped vinyl. Next up on the re-release schedule was Speak Now [Taylor\\'s Version], which arrived in July 2023 with six additional songs that were written for but not included on the 2010 LP. Fall Out Boy and Paramore\\'s Hayley Williams, both cited influences for Speak Now, appeared on two of those songs. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'With his melodic songs and inspirational lyrics Swedish house producer Avicii was one of the defining artists of modern pop. The genre-bending tracks captivated audiences worldwide and are widely considered the soundtrack of a generation.Born 1989 in Stockholm, Tim Bergling grew up being obsessed with video games, a passion that in his teens translated into him making music. After being discovered through a blog and gaining some traction with ”Seek Bromance”, his career exploded in 2011 with ”Levels”. His way of boldly blending musical styles became a trademark of Avicii, shown on full display on his first album ”True”. The leading single ”Wake Me Up”, a fusion of house music and traditional bluegrass, reached the number one spot on the iTunes charts in over 60 countries. The song became the most streamed ever on Spotify to that date, played over 200 million times, and turned Avicii into a sought-after pop producer, collaborating with stars such as Madonna and Coldplay.After touring the world at a frantic pace, all the while struggling with health issues and substance abuse, in 2015 Tim Bergling retired from performing live altogether. The slower lifestyle allowed him to focus purely on composing, drawing inspiration this time mainly from African and Asian traditions. Bergling was working on his fourth project, ”Tim”, when he tragically passed away during a holiday trip to Oman, in April of 2018. He is regarded as one of the most influential house producers of all time.'\n",

They were an established arena act before taking a hiatus that ended in 2022 with a featured spot on the Kygo single \"Dancing Feet\" as well as their own \"Move.\" Formed in 2015, DNCE (which stands for dance) is centered on former Jonas Brothers singer Joe Jonas and also includes Korean-born guitarist JinJoo Lee (Jordin Sparks, Charlie XCX, Cee Lo Green), bassist/keyboardist Cole Whittle (Semi-Precious Weapons), and drummer Jack Lawless (Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus). With the breakup of his phenomenally popular band the Jonas Brothers in 2013, Jonas began percolating the concept of forming another act. However, rather than choosing to hire studio musicians, he eventually wrangled the talents of former Jonas Brothers touring drummer Lawless, along with Lee, who opened for the Brothers while touring with Jordin Sparks. Jonas then brought on dynamic Semi-Precious Weapons member Whittle, and DNCE was complete. In September 2015, DNCE released the single \"Cake by the Ocean,\" premiering the track on New York\\'s Z100, with the fully fledged SWAAY EP appearing a month later. The EP cracked the Top 40 in the U.S. and the Top 20 in Canada.In 2016, they released the full-length DNCE, featuring production and songwriting contributions from a handful of industry luminaries including Sir Nolan, Ilya, and Mattman &amp; Robin, as well as former Semi-Precious Weapons frontman Justin Tranter. Buoyed by the previously released \"Cake by the Ocean\" as well as the leadoff single \"Body Moves,\" the album performed well, reaching number 17 on the Billboard 200. Following extensive touring, DNCE returned in 2018 with the People to People EP, which they followed with a hiatus.When the band reappeared in February 2022, it was without Whittle on the Kygo track \"Dancing Feet,\" which hit the Top Ten of the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart in addition to charting internationally.

      "'Justin Timberlake may be the quintessential pop star of the new millennium, a star who jumped from platform to platform on his way to establishing himself as something bigger than a star: he was a self-sustained empire. Timberlake began his rise as a TV star, performing on The New Mickey Mouse Club as a child in the \\'90s, but he earned his superstardom as one of the frontmen for *NSYNC, the most popular boy band of the turn of the millennium. Justin stepped away from the band just as its popularity crested, releasing the sleek Justified in 2002, its hit singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\" establishing him as a force outside the group, and he consolidated that success in 2006 with FutureSex/LoveSounds, the album that generated his biggest hit, \"SexyBack.\" After reaching this pop peak, he decided to pursue other ventures, choosing to concentrate on acting and entrepreneurship. Recurring appearances on Saturday Night Live proved to be among the show\\'s most popular spots and he received acclaim for his performance in the 2010 Oscar-winning film The Social Network. After juggling numerous ventures outside the music industry, Timberlake returned to the top of the charts with help from Timbaland. Timberlake\\'s journey to stardom began in Memphis, Tennessee, where he was born on January 31, 1981. He began performing early, appearing on the televised talent competition Star Search at the age of 11, singing under the name of Justin Randall. This was his first step into the big leagues, leading to him securing a spot on The New Mickey Mouse Club in 1993. This cast would prove to be filled with future stars; in addition to Timberlake there were the pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, actor Ryan Gosling, and JC Chasez, who\\'d later join Justin in *NSYNC, the group manager Lou Pearlman assembled in the late \\'90s. Pearlman formed *NSYNC after the cancellation of The New Mickey Mouse Club in 1994, taking Timberlake and Chasez as his anchors and adding Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, and Chris Kirkpatrick.*NSYNC began their march toward stardom in 1996 when their first album appeared in Europe. Two years later, their eponymous debut was released in the U.S. and the group scored hits with \"Tearin\\' Up My Heart,\" \"I Want You Back,\" and \"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You.\" The latter reached the Top Ten, paving the way for the smash success of No Strings Attached in 2000. Within one week of its March 2000 release, the album sold an astonishing 2.4 million copies and set a record that stood for 15 years. After generating the singles \"It\\'s Gonna Be Me\" and \"Bye Bye Bye,\" the group set to work on its next album, 2001\\'s Celebrity. It was another massive hit, launching the Top Ten singles \"Pop,\" \"Gone,\" and \"Girlfriend, but it proved to be the group\\'s last album, as Timberlake\\'s popularity was quickly eclipsing that of the rest of the group.It didn\\'t take long for Justin to release his first solo album. Justified appeared a little over a year after Celebrity and its gleaming, stylish surfaces -- partially produced by the Neptunes and partially produced by Timbaland -- suggested a new, mature, adventurous musician who was as much an R&amp;B vocalist as he was a pop singer. Timberlake supported the album with a co-headlining tour with Christina Aguilera in 2003 and he ruled the airwaves with the singles \"Like I Love You,\" \"Cry Me a River,\" Señorita,\" and \"Rock Your Body,\" not to mention the \"I\\'m Lovin\\' It\" jingle for McDonalds. He weathered a scandal in early 2004 when he tore off part of Janet Jackson\\'s costume during their half-time duet at Super Bowl XXXVIII, but he bounced back nicely, winning Grammys that year for Justified and \"Cry Me a River.\" He also launched William Rast, a clothing line.As he worked on his second album with producer Timbaland, Timberlake found time to resume his acting career, taking on key roles in Southland Tales, Black Snake Moan, and Alpha Dog. Before any of these films appeared, his second album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, was released, preceded by the single \"SexyBack,\" a cool synthesized groove in the vein of Prince that established the tone for the album. \"SexyBack\" stayed at number one for seven weeks and its two sequels, \"My Love\" and \"What Goes Around.../...Comes Around Interlude,\" also reached number one over the following year, a year that also saw Justin launch an international tour in support of the album.Following the completion of the FutureSex/LoveSounds tour, Timberlake slowly stepped away from music, though he was featured on three major 2007-2008 pop hits: Timbaland\\'s \"Give It to Me\" (number one), 50 Cent\\'s \"Ayo Technology\" (number five), and Madonna\\'s \"4 Minutes\" (number three). He had other musical endeavors over the next few years, but his main focus was acting. In 2007 he had a voice role in Shrek 3, and in 2008 had a lead part in Mike Myers\\' The Love Guru. Two years later, Timberlake had his greatest acting success as Sean Parker in David Fincher\\'s The Social Network; he quickly followed this with roles in Bad Teacher and Friends with Benefits. During this period, he also appeared several times on Saturday Night Live.In January 2013, after investing in three Los Angeles and New York restaurants, he released a new single, \"Suit &amp; Tie,\" co-produced with Timbaland. Along with a glitzy performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards and another SNL appearance, it set the stage for The 20/20 Experience, released that March. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and eventually went double platinum, driven by Top Five showings for its singles, \"Suit &amp; Tie\" and \"Mirrors.\" Two months later, the Coen Brothers film Inside Llewyn Davis, in which he co-starred, premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and won the Grand Prix. Part two of The 20/20 Experience, recorded during the same session that resulted in the first, was released that September. It followed the first to the top of the charts, and produced three Top 40 singles, \"Take Back the Night,\" \"TKO,\" and \"Not a Bad Thing.\" In 2014, Timberlake returned to the Top Ten as a featured guest on \"Love Never Felt So Good,\" a track from Michael Jackson\\'s posthumous album Xscape. \"Can\\'t Stop the Feeling!,\" recorded for the soundtrack of Trolls (a DreamWorks production in which Timberlake provided one of the lead voices), topped the pop chart months ahead of the film\\'s 2016 theatrical release. Timberlake also co-composed the soundtrack for The Book of Love, a film co-produced and co-starring his wife, Jessica Biel, released later that year. In 2018, Timberlake returned with the Danja- and Timbaland-produced \"Filthy.\" \"Supplies\" and the Chris Stapleton collaboration \"Say Something\" followed shortly thereafter as the second and third previews of Man of the Woods. The release of his fourth album coincided with a halftime performance at Super Bowl LII. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'With her omnivorous musical tastes and cheeky attitude, London-based pop singer/songwriter Lily Allen made a name for herself almost as soon as she released her demos on the Internet. The daughter of comedian Keith Allen, Lily spent most of her childhood bouncing from one school to another; in fact, she attended 13 different schools between the ages of five and 15. This constant moving meant she didn\\'t have much of a chance to make lasting friendships, so Allen entertained herself with books and, especially, music: she listened to everything from T. Rex, the Specials, and the Slits to the Happy Mondays and drum\\'n\\'bass, and even ran away to see the Glastonbury Festival when she was 14. After she left school a year later, she realized that music was the only career for her. Allen concentrated on her songwriting and singing, developing a style that was equally sweet and bratty; late in 2005, she set up a MySpace page and posted demos of her songs, as both individual tracks and as part of two limited-edition \"mixtapes\" that also featured tracks by Dizzee Rascal, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Ludacris. The critical acclaim for her work fueled Allen\\'s publicity, leading to tens of thousands of friends on MySpace, airplay on BBC Radio One, and a record deal with Regal/Parlophone before the end of 2005. Allen began working on her full-length album with producers such as Greg Kurstin, Mark Ronson (with whom she also collaborated on a cover of the Kaiser Chiefs\\' \"Oh My God\" that appeared on her second mixtape), and Futurecut, and released a limited-edition 7\" of LDN as her debut single in spring 2006. Both LDN and Smile, which followed that summer, were chart successes, with the former reaching number seven on the U.K. chart and the latter hitting number one the week it debuted. Hot on the heels of Smile came Allen\\'s first full-length, Alright, Still, which she supported with a slew of dates stretching out to the end of the year. Despite the speed of her success, Allen continued to update her MySpace page with amusing blog rants, including one about her June 2006 appearance on Top of the Pops that berated the lead singer of the Kooks for \"wearing broken straw hats and dark sunglasses\" indoors and Dirty Pretty Things for having \"organic sliced bread on the rider.\" Allen rang in 2007 with more tour dates, including gigs in Japan, Australia, and the U.S., and the U.S. release of Alright, Still. She also earned nominations for British Breakthrough Act and British Female Solo for that year\\'s Brit Awards, while \"Smile\" and Alright, Still were nominated for British Single and British Album, respectively.Allen spent most of 2007 touring, but also collaborated with Dizzee Rascal on Maths and English\\'s duet \"Wanna Be,\" and provided vocals on Basement Jaxx\\'s Crazy Itch Radio. Allen\\'s personal life and side projects were nearly as prominent as her music career, with her relationship with Chemical Brother Ed Simons and her subsequent miscarriage making headlines in late 2007 and early 2008. In February 2008, Allen embarked on a talk show on BBC Three, Lily Allen and Friends, which lasted through that April. That month, Allen posted two new demos on her MySpace page, including \"GWB,\" which was about President George Bush; for her second album, she worked with producer Greg Kurstin of the Bird and the Bee, and co-wrote several songs with him instead of just providing the lyrics. She also worked on songs with Jamie Reynolds of the Klaxons and wrote a song about comedian James Corden for the 2008 Shockwaves Awards. Another new song, \"Everyone\\'s at It,\" debuted that fall, and Allen courted controversy again with an unauthorized cover of Britney Spears\\' \"Womanizer\" that December. It\\'s Not Me, It\\'s You, which covered topics like drugs, fame, family, and society, arrived early in 2009, preceded by the single \"The Fear.\" Despite the album\\'s success, which included platinum certification in the U.K. and a debut at the top of the charts in the U.K., Canada, and Australia (and at number five in the U.S.), in September 2009 Allen did not renew her record contract and took a hiatus from making music.She remained busy, however, founding her own label In the Name Of (which included Cults on its roster), writing songs for the musical version of Bridget Jones\\' Diary, and starting a family with her boyfriend Sam Cooper, whom she married in June 2011. The following year, she announced that she was in the studio working on new music with longtime producer Greg Kurstin; she also sang vocals on P!nk\\'s 2012 single \"True Love,\" which was produced by Kurstin. Early in 2013, she gave birth to her second child. By November 2013, she had released a cover of Keane\\'s \"Somewhere Only We Know\" for a holiday television commercial by U.K. retailer John Lewis. The single version promptly became her third U.K. number one single. Two subsequent singles, \"Hard Out Here\" and \"Air Balloon,\" both reached the British Top Ten as well, and both appeared on her third album, Sheezus, which appeared in early May 2014. The album debuted at number one in the U.K., and hit number 12 on the U.S. Billboard 200. Following the album\\'s release, Allen performed at Glastonbury Festival, and embarked on a headlining tour which took her through 2015. In 2018, she returned with her fourth studio album, No Shame, which included the single \"Trigger Bang\" featuring rapper Giggs. The album found her moving away from longtime producer Kurstin, and embracing a more intimate, electropop sound. The album also appeared on the heels of a difficult period for the singer, who had gone to court over ongoing harassment by stalker Alex Gray (Gray was convicted and sentenced to an indeterminate hospital stay in 2016 after having broken into her house and threatened her). Allen, who amicably divorced husband Cooper in 2018, also admitted in an interview with Vulture to having gone through an \"identity crisis\" during and after the recording of Sheezus, and subsequently worked to regain her creative direction. No Shame debuted at number eight on the U.K. albums chart. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi'\n",

      "'A dynamic pop outfit with burlesque roots, the Pussycat Dolls make dance-oriented anthems infused with electronic, hip-hop, and R&amp;B influences. Rising out of the famed Los Angeles neo-burlesque troupe of the same name, the Pussycat Dolls gained widespread fame with their 2005 Top Five Billboard debut, PCD, which spawned the hit singles \"Don\\'t Cha,\" \"Stickwitu,\" and \"Buttons.\" The group remained chart favorites with their follow-up, 2008\\'s Doll Domination, and appeared on their own reality show before disbanding in 2010. In 2019, the Pussycat Dolls reunited, singing their song \"React\" on the U.K.\\'s X Factor: Celebrity finale.Founded by choreographer Robin Antin in 1995 in Los Angeles, the Pussycat Dolls initially began as a modern burlesque dance revue based out of the Viper Room nightclub. Under Antin\\'s creative guidance, the Dolls gained buzz with their saucy dance routines set to a mix of songs from the \\'50s and \\'60s. By 2001, the group had re-established themselves at Los Angeles\\' Roxy nightclub, a period that also found them attracting actresses and models who wanted to become a Pussycat Doll for a night. Christina Aguilera, Pamela Anderson, Kelly Osbourne, P!nk, Britney Spears, Carmen Electra, and Gwen Stefani were just some of the names who performed alongside the Dolls during their flirtatious cabaret shows. The attention helped land the group an appearance in the 2003 film Charlie\\'s Angels: Full Throttle, followed by numerous television appearances, most with Carmen Electra. Building upon the group\\'s growing popularity, Antin signed a development deal with Interscope Records and began transforming them into a full-fledged pop outfit. By 2003, the Pussycat Dolls\\' lineup had solidified around lead singer (and former Eden\\'s Crush member) Nicole Scherzinger, as well as members Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Melody Thornton, and Kimberly Wyatt. In April 2005, they released the Cee Lo Green-produced single \"Don\\'t Cha\" with special guest Busta Rhymes. The song climbed to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and number one on the Dance Club Songs chart. The group\\'s full-length debut, PCD, followed that September and featured production and songwriting contributions from will.i.am, Timbaland, Ron Fair, and others. It hit number five on the Billboard 200. Along with \"Don\\'t Cha,\" the album spawned several more number one hit singles, including \"Buttons\" and \"Stickwitu,\" the latter of which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.In March 2008, original member Bachar left to pursue a solo career. Continuing as a five-piece, the Pussycat Dolls released their sophomore album, Doll Domination, that September. Buoyed by the Top Ten single \"When I Grow Up,\" the album landed at number four on the Billboard 200. Following the group\\'s 2009 world tour, rumors began to swirl regarding tension within the ensemble. Subsequently, by the end of 2010, the Pussycat Dolls had effectively disbanded.Following the group\\'s break-up, Scherzinger began focusing on her solo work, releasing 2011\\'s Killer Love and 2014\\'s Big Fat Lie. By 2017, rumors began to circulate that the Pussycat Dolls were considering a reunion. Finally, in November 2019, Scherzinger and several former members of the Pussycat Dolls did reunite, performing a medley of their hits, including \"Buttons,\" \"When I Grow Up,\" and \"Don\\'t Cha,\" as well as a new song \"React,\" on the finale of Britain\\'s The X Factor: Celebrity. Following the reunion the group embarked on a live tour and guested on singer Meghan Trainor\\'s song \"Genetics\" off her 2020 album Treat Myself. ~ Matt Collar, Rovi'\n",

      "'Maroon 5 -- and, specifically, its frontman Adam Levine -- became the face of blue-eyed soul in the 21st century, managing to navigate shifting trends in music and fashion to be one of the biggest pop bands of their generation. They took the long way to the top, evolving from the straight-ahead \\'90s rock band Kara\\'s Flowers into the sleek, soulful Maroon 5 with 2002\\'s Songs About Jane, an album that languished for two years until \"This Love\" climbed to number five on Billboard\\'s Hot 100 in 2004. From that point forward, the group was a fixture at the top of the charts, their popularity receiving a considerable and enduring boost when Levine was cast as a judge on NBC\\'s televised talent competition The Voice in 2011. That year, their Christina Aguilera duet \"Moves Like Jagger\" gave Maroon 5 their second number one -- \"Makes Me Wonder\" went to the top in 2007 -- and kicked off a string of Top Ten hits highlighted by the number ones \"One More Night\" and \"Girls Like You,\" a run that helped secure the band a headlining Super Bowl gig in 2019. \"Girls Like You\" featured an appearance by Cardi B, a sign of how Maroon 5 kept current by embracing modern R&amp;B and hip-hop. The band followed this blueprint by enlisting Megan Thee Stallion for \"Beautiful Mistakes,\" a lead single from 2021\\'s Jordi, as well as the 2021 Bantu remix of \"One Light\" and the 2023 single \"Middle Ground.\"Prior to Maroon 5, bandmates Adam Levine (vocals/guitar), Jesse Carmichael (keyboards), Mickey Madden (bass), and Ryan Dusick (drums) had spent the latter half of the \\'90s playing in Kara\\'s Flowers, even releasing a debut album for Reprise Records while still attending high school. The record tanked, however, and Kara\\'s Flowers found themselves dropped from Reprise\\'s roster. After briefly attending college, the bandmates regrouped as Maroon 5, adding former Square guitarist James Valentine to the lineup and embracing a more R&amp;B-influenced sound. Several years later, the quintet had officially risen to the forefront of pop music with Songs About Jane and It Won\\'t Be Soon Before Long, both of which went multi-platinum. Songs About Jane propelled the band into the mainstream, but the album was not an immediate hit. Octone Records had signed the newly christened Maroon 5 in 2001, and the debut album Jane received a lukewarm response upon its release in June 2002. \"Harder to Breathe\" became a radio staple 17 months later and was soon followed by the omnipresent \"This Love,\" whose steamy video (featuring frontman Levine and a barely clothed girlfriend) wooed the TV-watching crowds at MTV. Songs About Jane finally entered the Billboard Top Ten in August 2004, more than two years after the album\\'s release, and follow-up singles like \"She Will Be Loved\" and \"Sunday Morning\" helped the album move over 2.7 million copies by year\\'s end. Maroon 5 toured exhaustively in support of Jane\\'s slow-burning success, issuing two stopgap recordings -- 2004\\'s 1.22.03.Acoustic and 2005\\'s Live Friday the 13th -- while traveling the world alongside the likes of the Rolling Stones and John Mayer. Their schedule was especially trying on percussionist Dusick, who sustained wrist and shoulder injuries and was often unable to play. By fall 2006, Dusick had been officially replaced by Matt Flynn (the former drummer for Gavin DeGraw), and the revised band released its sophomore effort in May 2007. It Won\\'t Be Soon Before Long proved to be less popular than its predecessor (which had sold more than four million copies in the U.S. alone), but it still enjoyed double-platinum certification while spinning off the chart-topping single \"Makes Me Wonder.\" Maroon 5 had cemented their status as pop/rock heavyweights, and they now had the connections to prove it. Released in late 2008, Call and Response: The Remix Album reinterpreted the band\\'s catalog with remixes by influential producers like Mary J. Blige, Mark Ronson, and Pharrell Williams.Between 2008 and 2010, the band worked with a different producer -- veteran rock/country architect Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange -- on a third studio album, Hands All Over, which was released in September 2010. Although it was kept from the top of the album charts, it went platinum. Also, the following year, it received a big boost when Levine began appearing as a judge on the NBC reality television talent competition The Voice. That same year, Hands All Over was re-released with the single \"Moves Like Jagger,\" featuring Levine\\'s The Voice co-judge Christina Aguilera; the single promptly hit the top of the charts. In 2012, Carmichael revealed that he was taking time off from performing with Maroon 5 and would be replaced by touring keyboardist PJ Morton.In April 2012, the band teased the release of its fourth studio album with \"Payphone,\" a single featuring Wiz Khalifa that hit number two. The resulting album, Overexposed, also reached number two, featuring production from a bevy of name producers including Ryan Tedder, Max Martin, Benny Blanco, and more. A second single from the album, the reggae-tinged \"One More Night,\" topped the charts not long after its release in June, and stayed at the top long enough to become the band\\'s most successful showing to date. Two further singles also reached the Top Ten, \"Daylight\" and \"Love Somebody.\" During 2013, Levine continued to appear on The Voice, and also made appearances in the television drama American Horror Story, as well as the music-based dramatic film Begin Again. The band also hit the studio to record songs for a fifth studio album, aptly titled V, which saw keyboardist Jesse Carmichael return to the fold after a brief hiatus. Released in September 2014, V debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart and produced several Top Ten singles including \"Maps,\" \"Animals,\" and \"Sugar.\" Two more singles followed in 2015 with \"This Summer\\'s Gonna Hurt Like a Motherf*****\" and \"Feelings.\" Also in 2015, Maroon 5 released their first hits collection, The Singles. The single \"Don\\'t Wanna Know,\" featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar, appeared in 2016 and peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was later revealed to be the first single from their forthcoming sixth LP. A second collaborative single, \"Cold,\" featuring Future, was released in early 2017, with \"What Lovers Do\" appearing before the November release of Red Pill Blues. A reference to the choice of taking either red or blue pills first presented in the 1999 sci-fi film The Matrix, Red Pill Blues also featured guest appearances by Julia Michaels, SZA, ASAP Rocky, and LunchMoney Lewis. It peaked at number two on the Billboard 200. In 2018, the band issued a remix of the album track \"Girls You Like,\" featuring an appearance by Cardi B, which wound up being their first single to reach number one on the Billboard charts since 2012\\'s \"One More Night.\"On February 3, 2019, Maroon 5 headlined the Super Bowl LIII halftime show in Atlanta, Georgia, supported by rappers Big Boi and Travis Scott. That September, they released \"Memories\" as the lead-single off their seventh studio-album, Jordi. Both the song and the album title were dedicated to the band\\'s late manager, Jordan Feldstein who died in December 2017 from pulmonary embolism. In 2020, bassist Mickey Madden announced he was retiring from the group following an arrest for domestic violence allegations. The band carried on with the topical single \"Nobody\\'s Love,\" which was partly inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and racial protests following the murder of George Floyd. They also teamed up with Megan Thee Stallion for the 2021 single \"Beautiful Mistakes.\" All of this led up to the release of Jordi, which arrived in June 2021, peaking at number 8 on the Billboard 200. A fourth single, \"Lost,\" appeared soon after, charting at 27 on the Pop 100. More tracks followed, including a 2022 remix of \"One Light\" by Bantu, featuring Yung Bleu and Latto, and 2023\\'s \"Middle Ground,\" the latter of which found the band working with producers Andrew Watt, Jon Bellion, and Pete Nappi. ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Ne-Yo, the three-time GRAMMY Award-winning R&amp;B hitmaker, iconic songwriter, actor, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, has sold a cumulative 20+ million adjusted albums worldwide. His debut single, 2005's “So Sick,” hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified quadruple Platinum. Since then, the Motown Records/Compound Entertainment recording artist has racked up a collection of hits including “Sexy Love,” “Closer,” “Because of You,” “Miss Independent,” and “Push Back” [feat. Bebe Rexha and Stefflon Don]. Three of his albums have entered SoundScan's Top Current Albums chart at No. 1. Ne-Yo has also proven to be as powerful with his pen as he is in the studio and on stage. The Las Vegas native quickly became known as a go-to hitmaker, penning bangers like Rihanna's “Unfaithful,” “Russian Roulette,” and “Take a Bow,” along with Beyoncé's 2006 breakup anthem “Irreplaceable” and songs for such artists as Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Carrie Underwood, and Celine Dion, among others. Ne-Yo's film and television credits include NBC's World of Dance, Empire, Stomp the Yard, Save the Last Dance, Battle: Los Angeles, George Lucas' Red Tails, The Wiz Live!, and Starz' Step Up: High Water.

      "'Among the most popular and acclaimed artists in postmillennial contemporary music, Rihanna is also uncommonly dynamic, having mixed and matched pure pop, dancehall, R&amp;B, EDM, and adult contemporary material throughout her career. She went supernova in 2005 with her boisterous debut single, \"Pon de Replay,\" a worldwide hit, and was a near-constant presence in the upper reaches of global pop charts until she took a break from releasing music in the late 2010s. Through 2017, the native Barbadian headlined 11 number one hits, including \"Umbrella\" and \"Only Girl (In the World),\" singles that earned her two of her nine Grammy Awards. More than just a singles artist, Rihanna continually pushed ahead stylistically with her LPs, highlighted by the bold Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), the steely Rated R (2009), and the composed Anti (2016), all of which confounded expectations and placed within the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 with eventual multi-platinum certifications. Rihanna studded her secondary discography as a featured artist during this period with major crossover pop hits headlined by the likes of Jay-Z (\"Run This Town\"), Eminem (\"Love the Way You Lie\"), and Kendrick Lamar (\"LOYALTY.\"). She returned to the Top Ten in 2022 with the understated ballad \"Lift Me Up,\" her first solo release in six years, recorded for the soundtrack of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty in Saint Michael, Barbados, Rihanna exhibited star quality as a child, often winning beauty and talent contests. Because she lived on a fairly remote island in the West Indies, however, she didn\\'t foresee the global stardom she later attained. Her break came courtesy of a fateful meeting with Evan Rogers, writer and producer of pop hits for such big names as *NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Rod Stewart. The New Yorker was vacationing in Barbados with his wife, an island native, when he was introduced to an aspiring singing group that featured Rihanna. The trio performed for Rogers, who was then eager to work with Rihanna as a solo artist. After the fledgling singer recorded material with Rogers in the U.S. and signed with SRP (Syndicated Rhythm Productions), operated by Rogers and partner Carl Sturken, she sparked the interest of the Carter Administration -- that is, the newly appointed Def Jam president Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter. Following an audition, Rihanna accepted an on-the-spot offer to sign with the major label. Come May 2005, Def Jam rolled out \"Pon de Replay,\" Rihanna\\'s first single and the lively introduction to the full-length Music of the Sun. Produced almost entirely by Rogers and Sturken, the song synthesized Caribbean rhythms with pop-R&amp;B songwriting. \"Pon de Replay\" caught fire almost immediately and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, denied the top spot by Mariah Carey\\'s \"We Belong Together.\" Music of the Sun, released that August, spawned a Top 40 placement with \"If It\\'s Lovin\\' That You Want\" and ranged stylistically from a remake of Dawn Penn\\'s rocksteady-styled crossover hit \"You Don\\'t Love Me (No, No, No)\" (featuring dancehall star Vybz Kartel) to the Beyoncé-like \"Let Me\" (co-produced by emergent duo Stargate). Music of the Sun was only eight months old when Rihanna followed up in April 2006 with A Girl Like Me. It showed that the singer wasn\\'t a fluke success and could also stretch out, laced with three dissimilar hits. \"SOS,\" high-gloss dance-pop with a sample of Soft Cell\\'s version of \"Tainted Love,\" topped the Hot 100. \"Unfaithful,\" her first big ballad, and \"Break It Off,\" an electro-dancehall hybrid (with Sean Paul), became her third and fourth Top Ten pop singles.Superstar status was attained with Good Girl Gone Bad, an album that built on Rihanna\\'s commercial momentum and developed into a blockbuster. Released in May 2007 and \"reloaded\" with additional material the following June, its lengthy promotional campaign yielded several chart-topping singles and boasted collaborations with A-listers such as Jay-Z, Ne-Yo, Timbaland, and Justin Timberlake. Lead single \"Umbrella,\" co-written by the-Dream and Christopher \"Tricky\" Stewart, sounded like nothing else on the airwaves and shot to number one, as did \"Take a Bow\" and \"Disturbia,\" while \"Hate That I Love You\" and \"Don\\'t Stop the Music\" added to the tally of Top Ten entries. \"Umbrella\" gave Rihanna her first Grammy win for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. The album was on its way to triple-platinum status by October 2009, when Rihanna set the dark and provocative tone for fourth album Rated R with \"Russian Roulette,\" another Ne-Yo collaboration and Top Ten single. Abused lover, dominatrix, and murderer were among the perspectives Rihanna offered throughout the album, released that November. Even the additional Top Ten hits \"Hard\" and \"Rude Boy\" -- the latter her fifth number one -- were stern in demeanor, making the early hits sound like the work of a significantly more complex artist. While Rated R was riding high, Jay-Z\\'s \"Run This Town,\" with Rihanna on the intro and hook, won Grammys for Best Rap Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.Annual studio albums, each one with a November release date and a broad range of light and dark material covering EDM, contemporary R&amp;B, adult contemporary, dancehall, and straight-up pop, continued well into the following decade. In 2010, just after Eminem featured her on the diamond platinum \"Love the Way You Lie,\" there was Loud. Led by the Stargate-produced \"Only Girl (In the World),\" eventually a Grammy winner for Best Dance Recording, it was sustained with additional Hot 100 toppers \"What\\'s My Name?\" (featuring Drake) and \"S&amp;M.\" Talk That Talk was heralded in 2011 with Rihanna\\'s most triumphant single, \"We Found Love,\" on which she collaborated with Calvin Harris. After she nabbed yet another Best Rap/Sung Collaboration Grammy, this time for her role on Kanye West\\'s \"All of the Lights,\" the streak concluded, and culminated, with the 2012 set Unapologetic. Her first LP to top the Billboard 200 (after all of the previous six had gone Top Ten), it also became her first to win a Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. \"Diamonds,\" the anthemic and inspirational standout among some of Rihanna\\'s brashest moments, became her tenth number one pop hit and 18th to peak within the Top Ten.Within a span of three years, Rihanna had released her fourth through seventh albums. An equal amount of time passed prior to the release of her eighth full-length. In 2013, she lengthened her list of chart accolades as a featured artist with an assist on Eminem\\'s \"The Monster,\" which became her 25th Top Ten hit as a lead or featured artist, went to number one, and led to her fourth Best Rap/Sung Collaboration Grammy. No longer with Def Jam -- a deal had been signed with Roc Nation via Jay-Z, who left Def Jam several years earlier -- Rihanna released non-album singles throughout 2015, beginning with the unembellished \"FourFiveSeconds,\" an unlikely matchup with Paul McCartney and Kanye West that reached number four. \"American Oxygen\" didn\\'t flourish as much from a commercial standpoint but upon release became one of her most remarkable recordings, a dignified ballad with a personal, pro-immigration theme.Album eight, the strikingly composed Anti, became Rihanna\\'s second consecutive number one album following its January 2016 arrival. She partnered again with Drake, resulting in another number one hit with \"Work.\" \"Needed Me,\" a buzzing slow jam cooked up with a production team including DJ Mustard and Kuk Harrell, and \"Love on the Brain,\" a throwback soul belter involving Harrell and Fred Ball, entered the Top Ten as well. Those who missed the comparative lack of high-spirited exuberance in Anti were placated across 2016 and 2017 with Rihanna\\'s guest appearances on Calvin Harris\\' \"This Is What You Came For\" and N.E.R.D.\\'s \"Lemon.\" Meanwhile, Drake, Future, DJ Khaled, and Kendrick Lamar likewise profited from Rihanna\\'s featured spots. Lamar\\'s \"LOYALTY.\" made Rihanna a five-time winner of the Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, setting a record for women artists in that category.Apart from a featured appearance on PartyNextDoor\\'s 2020 single \"Believe It,\" Rihanna wasn\\'t behind any new music for several years, as she focused her efforts on her Fenty cosmetics and fashion empire and started a family. She returned in October 2022 with \"Lift Me Up\" from the soundtrack of Ryan Coogler\\'s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. The ballad, written by Rihanna with producer Ludwig Göransson, Tems, and Coogler, entered the Hot 100 at number two. ~ Andy Kellman &amp; Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

      "'Nicki Minaj skyrocketed from mixtape phenom to pop star with a unique combination of ferocity and humor she continues to flaunt with razor-sharp wordplay, mercilessly blunt lyricism, and a vocal style that turns on a dime from sugary to snarling. The rapper\\'s early days included attempts at an acting career and losing her job at Red Lobster for being rude to customers, but she progressed quickly from MySpace demos to nationally adored mixtapes to household-name status. Pink Friday, Minaj\\'s 2010 album debut, saw her appeal to a broader audience with chart-topping reception. Although she has had similar success with later full-lengths such as 2014\\'s The Pinkprint and 2018\\'s Queen, her singles have made an even greater impact. In just over a decade, Minaj has hit the Top 40 over two dozen times as a headliner with singles such as \"Super Bass,\" \"Starships,\" and \"Anaconda.\" These and other highlights were gathered in 2022 for Queen Radio, Vol. 1, an anthology containing the number one hit \"Super Freaky Girl\" among its new songs. Her Top 40 entries as a featured artist are even more numerous and include Kanye West\\'s \"Monster,\" David Guetta\\'s \"Turn Me On,\" and Ariana Grande\\'s \"Side to Side.\" Nicki Minaj was born Onika Tanya Maraj in 1982. Born in Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago to parents who were both gospel singers, she lived with her grandmother in Saint James until the age of five, when she joined her mother, who had relocated to Queens, New York. In high school she discovered the performing arts, setting her sights on acting as her main pursuit. She eventually transitioned into music, working as part of a group called the Hood$tars in the early 2000s before going solo. In 2007 she was discovered by Dirty Money Entertainment CEO Big Fendi, who happened upon her demos on MySpace and signed Maraj to the label. At Fendi\\'s suggestion, Maraj took on the stage name Nicki Minaj, jumbling her last name to reflect a more ruthless persona. Dirty Money Entertainment released both her 2007 debut mixtape, Playtime Is Over, and its 2008 follow-up, Sucka Free. Industry buzz was already surrounding Minaj on her earliest releases, and these mixtapes featured guest appearances from stars like Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Jadakiss, and Lil\\' Kim. The 2009 mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty was a favorite among a growing fan base and included her first songs to hit the Billboard charts. In August of 2009 Minaj signed to Lil Wayne\\'s Young Money Entertainment, becoming the label\\'s first female artist. The floodgates opened from there, as Minaj made cameo appearances on tracks from Gucci Mane, Kanye West, Pusha T, and others as well as offering verses to hits like \"Bedrock\" and \"Roger That\" from the 2009 Young Money collaborative album We Are Young Money. An official non-mixtape debut album came in the form of Pink Friday, released in November of 2010 but preceded by the hit singles \"Your Love\" and \"Check It Out.\" The album saw her leaning more into a pop style than the hard-edged rap of her mixtapes, but the hybrid of the two proved immediately successful, and the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and went platinum, selling upwards of 375,000 copies during its first week alone. She earned a handful of 2011 Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist, Best Rap Album, and Best Rap Performance. An all-out media blitz followed between albums, with extravagant performances at award shows across the globe, an appearance as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live, and joining Madonna -- alongside M.I.A. -- for her Super Bowl XLVI halftime show.In early 2012, the Euro-dance-influenced single \"Starships\" signaled the coming of her official sophomore effort, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, an album built around her devil-may-care alter ego \"Roman Zolanski.\" Guest artists included Nas, Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Chris Brown, and Beenie Man, while production came from the likes of RedOne and Ke\\'Noe. The album hit number one on the U.S. album charts, driven by a Top Ten showing for \"Starships,\" and \"Va Va Voom\" also reached the Top 40. By the end of 2012, Minaj had been announced as a judge for the 12th season of American Idol, although she left at the end of the season. It hardly affected her success, as she set two career records during 2013: the most-charted female rapper in the history of Billboard\\'s singles chart, and the first person to win Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the BET Awards four times in a row. In December 2014, Minaj released her third studio album, The Pinkprint. First single \"Lookin Ass\" was also featured on the Young Money compilation Rise of an Empire released in March of that year, while follow-up \"Anaconda\" was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 2015 Grammy Awards. Filled with songs about guilt and failed relationships, the album was well received by critics and debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. Throughout 2016, Minaj guested on numerous singles, including DJ Khaled\\'s \"Do You Mind\" and Ariana Grande\\'s \"Side to Side,\" and she also released her own \"Black Barbies.\" In 2017, she issued a trio of stand-alone singles: \"Regret in Your Tears,\" \"Changed It\" with Lil Wayne, and \"No Frauds\" with Lil Wayne and Drake. The latter track went gold and broke into the Top 20 of the Hot 100 and Top Ten of the R&amp;B and rap charts. That year, she also appeared on the Migos track \"MotorSport\" with Cardi B, and on Jason Derulo\\'s \"Swalla\" with Ty Dolla $ign. She returned with the singles \"Chun-Li\" and \"Barbie Tingz\" in spring 2018, paving the way for her fourth studio album, Queen, which arrived in August of that year. In addition to third single \"Bed\" featuring Ariana Grande, the LP also features guests Labrinth, Eminem, Lil Wayne, the Weeknd, Future, Foxy Brown, and Swae Lee. Upon release, Queen matched its predecessor with a number two debut on the Billboard 200. More singles arrived the following year, including the non-album track \"Megatron,\" \"Tusa\" with Karol G, \"Trollz\" with 6ix9ine. Minaj was also featured alongside Murda Beatz on PnB Rock 2019 track \"Fendi.\" In February 2020, the rapper returned with her own stand-alone song \"Yikes.\" Minaj\\'s third mixtape Beam Me Up Scotty was reissued in 2021, eleven years after its original release. The project was given new cover art and the track listing was altered somewhat, omitting some of the songs from the original 2009 release and including several new tracks. This new version of Minaj\\'s breakout project debuted in the number two spot on the Billboard 200, making it the highest-charting mixtape from a female rapper up to that point. Throughout the early 2020s, Minaj continued her usual bevy of guest features and collaborations, appearing on tracks by Doja Cat, former Little Mix vocalist Jesy Nelson, BIA, and Elton John. In 2022, she scored more hits as a lead artist with the Lil Baby collaborations \"Do We Have a Problem?\" and \"Bussin,\" then topped the pop chart with \"Super Freaky Girl.\" All three of these singles were included on Queen Radio, Vol. 1, a celebratory anthology released that August. Minaj kicked off 2023 with the flamenco- and trap-inspired \"Red Ruby da Sleeze,\" which she followed with a feature on YoungBoy Never Broke Again\\'s \"WTF.\" ~ David Jeffries &amp; Fred Thomas'\n",

      "'Idiosyncratic pop singer Ed Sheeran borrows from any style that crosses his path, molding genres to fit a musical character all his own that\\'s charming, personable, and popular on a global scale. Elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock can be heard in his big hits \"The A Team,\" \"Sing,\" \"Thinking Out Loud,\" and \"Shape of You\" -- which gives him a broad appeal among different demographics. It also helped elevate him to international acclaim not long after the release of his 2011 debut LP, +, and took 2014\\'s x and 2017\\'s ÷ to the top of both the U.K. albums chart and the Billboard 200. Sheeran maintained his stardom with savvy collaborations -- his 2019 album No. 6 Collaborations Project featured an eclectic roster including Khalid, Camila Cabello, Cardi B, Justin Bieber, Chris Stapleton, and Bruno Mars -- and by continuing to write candidly about his life: his 2021 album = was filled with songs about being a new father. Sheeran\\'s musical explorations continued on -, a 2023 album that featured several tracks co-written and co-produced by Aaron Dessner of the National.When Ed Sheeran released +, he had just turned 20. He had been playing music since he was a child in Framlingham, Suffolk -- he was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire but his family moved when he was young -- enthralled by the classic rock he heard around the house. Sheeran started writing music in his early teens, recording a self-made album called Spinning Man when he was 13 in 2004. In addition to making music at home -- he put out an EP titled The Orange Room in 2005 -- he\\'d busk on the streets and play whatever stage he could find. When he was 16, he dropped out of school and moved to London so he could make a go of a professional career, landing work as a guitar tech for Nizlopi, gigging whenever he could, and auditioning unsuccessfully for the ITV series Britannia High. The self-released EP You Need Me arrived in 2009 -- it followed 2006\\'s eponymous EP and 2007\\'s Want Some? -- but his momentum started to build in 2010 thanks to the EPs Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy and, especially, performance videos he posted to YouTube. Sheeran started to generate considerable buzz -- Jamie Foxx invited him to appear on his Sirius/XM radio show -- and he landed a deal with Asylum Records in late 2010. After a final independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations, arrived in January 2011, he signed a contract with Elton John\\'s management team.All of this laid the groundwork for a busy 2011. Sheeran entered the studio with Jake Gosling to record his major-label debut. Its first single, \"The A Team,\" arrived in June 2011, entering the charts at number three. August brought \"You Need Me, I Don\\'t Need You,\" setting the stage for the September release of +. Assisted by the success of November\\'s single \"Lego House,\" the record became a huge hit in the U.K., a fact underscored by his win of British Breakthrough in the 2012 Brit Awards. Sheeran\\'s success soon spread to Australia, Europe, Canada, and then the United States. He received a boost in the U.S. by opening for Snow Patrol in 2012, but that paled in comparison to the exposure he received opening for Taylor Swift on her Red tour in 2013. His endorsement from Swift, combined with his landing of the closing credits song \"I See Fire\" for The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, set Sheeran up for an eventful 2014.Along with reuniting with Jake Gosling, Sheeran worked with Rick Rubin and Pharrell for X, the sophomore set that arrived in June 2014. X debuted at number one on both sides of the Atlantic and generated the huge hits \"Thinking Out Loud\" and \"Sing,\" success that helped Sheeran secure a win for Album of the Year in the 2015 Brit Awards, along with the trophy for Best Male Solo Artist. His success wasn\\'t limited to Britain. X was the second biggest-selling album in the world in 2015, coming in behind Adele\\'s 25, and \"Thinking Out Loud\" took home the Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance in 2016.Sheeran spent the majority of 2016 recuperating and recording his third album with executive producer Benny Blanco. Early in 2017, he released two singles, \"Castle on the Hill\" and \"Shape of You,\" with the latter reaching number one on the charts throughout the world. Their parent album, ÷, appeared in March. ÷ topped the pop charts in over 20 territories, including the U.K. and U.S., and it generated another international hit in \"Galway Girl.\" Ed Sheeran\\'s massive popularity was confirmed in June 2017, when he was awarded an MBE on the occasion of the Queen\\'s Birthday Honours. Over the next year, Sheeran stayed busy touring. He also picked up several more accolades including winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album for ÷ and Best Pop Solo Performance for \"Shape of You.\" In 2019, he paired with Justin Bieber for the single \"I Don\\'t Care.\" It was the first of a series of duets which Sheeran collected on No. 6 Collaborations Project. The album appeared on July 12, 2019 and topped numerous charts just a few weeks after the release of Yesterday, a Danny Boyle film set in an alternate world where the Beatles never existed that featured Sheeran in a pivotal role. No. 6 Collaborations Project went on to be nominated for a Grammy in the Best Pop Vocal Album category. In December 2020, Sheeran offered up the acoustic non-album single, \"Afterglow\" as a Christmas gift to his fans. Sheeran returned with \"Bad Habits\" in June 2021; the single topped the charts in nearly every country, save the U.S., where it peaked at two. The track was the first single from his fifth album, =. Arriving in October 2021, the record found Sheeran grappling with fatherhood and featured songwriting collaborations from Foy Vance, Ben Kweller, and Natalie Hemby, among others. It continued Sheeran\\'s streak of number one albums in the U.K. and was equally successful internationally. That December, he joined Elton John for the holiday song \"Merry Christmas,\" which topped the U.K. singles chart and Billboard\\'s Adult Contemporary chart. The single was also included on a Christmas edition of =, as well as John\\'s The Lockdown Sessions. Sheeran then collaborated with Colombian singer J Balvin on 2021\\'s \"Sigue\" and 2022\\'s \"Forever My Love.\" Also in 2022, he scored a Top Ten U.K. hit with the Pokémon-related \"Celestial\" before kicking off 2023 with \"F64,\" a heartfelt tribute to the late British music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards. Sheeran launched the cycle for his fifth album in early 2023 with the release of the singles \"Eyes Closed\" and \"Boat.\" Both songs were included on -, a record that featured several collaborations with Aaron Dessner of the National, along with work by Max Martin, Shellback, and Foy Vance. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'A thoughtful performer with a distinctive voice and a knack for crafting melodic contemporary soft rock tunes, James Blunt is best known for his international chart-topping single \"You\\'re Beautiful,\" a mournful ode to unrequited love. It was the second single from his debut album, 2004\\'s Back to Bedlam, which became the U.K.\\'s top-selling album in 2005. Success soon followed in the U.S., where the song hit number one and the album went to number two early the next year. A former British Army officer, Blunt remained an international Top Ten artist through releases such as his optimistic third long-player, 2010\\'s Some Kind of Trouble and 2017\\'s The Afterlove, a more polished fifth full-length that saw him join forces with songwriter/producers including Ed Sheeran.Born in Tidworth, Wiltshire, England, in 1974 to a family with a long military history, Blunt learned piano, violin, and guitar in his youth and, with ambitions to pursue a career as a pop singer already well-ingrained, wrote an undergraduate thesis at the University of Bristol titled The Commodification of Image -- Production of a Pop Idol. Having enrolled at university on an Army scholarship, he next attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on his way to six years of service. Ultimately achieving the rank of captain, Blunt served with the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo and finished out his time in the military as a member of the Life Guard Regiment in the British Household Cavalry. He wasted no time in pursuing a pop career upon leaving the Army in October 2002.A subsequent performance at the 2004 South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, brought Blunt to the attention of 4 Non Blondes singer/producer Linda Perry, who signed Blunt to her Custard Records label. Released by Custard and Atlantic in 2005, Blunt\\'s debut album, Back to Bedlam, and its hit single, \"You\\'re Beautiful,\" were hugely successful -- the single hit number one in over a dozen countries and the album has sold over ten million copies worldwide. Blunt toured for much of 2005 and 2006, then issued the two-disc odds-and-sods audio-video release Chasing Time: The Bedlam Sessions in 2006. He had been writing songs while on the road, and invited Back to Bedlam\\'s Tom Rothrock to produce them. Recorded with Blunt\\'s live backing band, the set included writing collaborations with Mark Batson, Jimmy Hogarth, Steve McEwan, and Max Martin. The resulting All the Lost Souls arrived in September 2007. Featuring the U.K. number one single \"1973,\" it saw him top the album charts again in places such as the U.K., Canada, Australia, and parts of Western Europe, and went to number seven in the States.Disillusioned by success and a perceived loss of artistic credibility that came with a certain amount of ridicule for his earnest style, Blunt took a break from music before coming back in 2010 with his third full-length effort, Some Kind of Trouble. A more uplifting, spontaneous album influenced by \\'70s American pop/rock, it sold well, reaching the Top Five in his international strong holds. In 2012, he brought back Tom Rothrock to track his fourth album, Moon Landing. Featuring the country-folk-influenced U.K. number one \"Bonfire Heart,\" the record saw release in October 2013. Increasingly self-depreciating in public statements, Blunt let roughly three-and-a-half years pass before putting out another album. Released in early 2017, The Afterlove featured songwriting collaborations with, among others, his friend Ed Sheeran and OneRepublic\\'s Ryan Tedder. While it became his first album to miss the Top 20 in the U.S. (it peaked at 177), it returned him to the Top Ten elsewhere, including the U.K., where it reached number six. Still with Atlantic Records, he returned with his sixth full-length, Once Upon a Mind, in the second half of 2019. The album extended The Afterlove\\'s polished pop sound, balancing that with plaintive moments dedicated to his father and children. ~ Matt Collar &amp; Marcy Donelson, Rovi'\n",

      "'Along with fellow Virginians Missy Elliott, Timbaland, and Neptunes partner Chad Hugo, Pharrell Williams has played a crucial role in the progression of post-new jack swing R&amp;B and rap, and consequently pop. Williams actually got his start during the tail-end of the new jack era as the co-writer of Wreckx-N-Effect\\'s number two 1992 pop hit \"Rump Shaker,\" but he and Hugo truly distinguished themselves six years later as producers of Mase\\'s \"Lookin\\' at Me\" and Noreaga\\'s \"Superthug,\" crossover hits that showcased the duo\\'s uniquely chunky and choppy sound. Williams and Hugo built on this momentum throughout the 2000s, scoring hits that included Justin Timberlake\\'s \"Rock Your Body\" (2002), Jay-Z\\'s \"Excuse Me Miss\" (2003), Snoop Dogg\\'s \"Drop It Like It\\'s Hot\" (2004), and Ludacris\\' \"Money Maker\" (2006), all the while keeping their extracurricular genre-blind group N.E.R.D. afloat. After numerous accolades for the Neptunes, including a Grammy for Producer of the Year in 2004 and a Producer of the Decade acknowledgment from Billboard, the charismatic Williams remained a force in mainstream music as a producer, songwriter, tough-talking rapper, and falsetto-equipped singer. Working less frequently with Hugo, he added to his list of colorful hits songbook with Robin Thicke\\'s \"Blurred Lines\" (2013), Daft Punk\\'s \"Get Lucky\" (2013), and Kendrick Lamar\\'s \"Alright\" (2015). Williams likewise prospered with intermittent solo material, highlighted by the Top Five albums In My Mind (2006) and G I R L (2014), and the number one pop hit \"Happy\" (2013). After Williams co-produced the Academy Award-nominated Hidden Figures, and contributed music for the film\\'s soundtrack, he and Hugo reactivated N.E.R.D. with \"Lemon\" (2017), the group\\'s first Top 40 hit. Following collaborations with Migos, Camila Cabello, and the Carters, he joined with Tyler, The Creator and 21 Savage for 2022\\'s \"Cash In Cash Out.\"Pharrell Williams forged a long-term friendship and musical partnership with Chad Hugo while in seventh grade band camp. Among the Virginia Beach natives\\' aspirant peers in high school were Timothy \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Melvin \"Magoo\" Barcliff, with whom Williams recorded as S.B.I. (Surrounded by Idiots), but as the fledgling Neptunes, Williams and Hugo, joined by Shay Haley and Mike Etheridge, caught the attention of Teddy Riley. The new jack swing architect sponsored a talent show at Princess Anne High School, across the street from his Virginia Beach recording studio, and was impressed enough by the Neptunes\\' performance to sign the young musicians to a development deal. While producing his brother Markell\\'s group, Wreckx-N-Effect, Riley enlisted Williams to co-write \"Rump Shaker,\" which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 at the end of 1992. The following year, Williams could be heard calling out SWV\\'s name throughout that group\\'s Riley-produced \"Human Nature\" remix of \"Right Here.\" Together and separately, Williams and Hugo acquitted themselves the next few years with work for Riley\\'s Blackstreet, as well as SWV and Total. In 1996, the latter two groups were the first acts to release material crediting the Neptunes, by then the collaborative songwriting and production alias of Williams and Hugo.The Neptunes left their first indelible marks in 1998. Mase\\'s \"Lookin\\' at Me,\" featuring Puff Daddy, became Williams and Hugo\\'s first Top Ten pop hit that September, and Noreaga\\'s \"Superthug\" -- with Williams also providing the amusing intro and a secondary vocal -- hit number 36 that October. The duo soon became among the most prolific, revered, and successful producers in commercial R&amp;B, rap, and pop. Their sound, appealingly plastic-sounding with beats that could be replicated with a pair of fists pounding on a cafeteria table, became as identifiable and as mimicked as that of Timbaland and Missy Elliott, who had entered the mainstream a few years earlier. Among the Neptunes\\' most creative and popular productions during this early run were Ol\\' Dirty Bastard\\'s \"Got Your Money\" (1999), Kelis\\' \"Caught Out There\" (1999), Jay-Z\\'s \"I Just Wanna Love U\" (2000), Britney Spears\\' \"I\\'m a Slave 4 U\" (2001), Nelly\\'s \"Hot in Here\" (2002), Clipse\\'s \"Grindin\\'\" (2002), and Justin Timberlake\\'s \"Rock Your Body\" (2003). The last of that bunch led to a Grammy award in the category of Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. As the Neptunes continued to take on commissioned work, Williams\\' voice became increasingly familiar. He was now more likely to provide the chorus and the background vocals of the same song, in addition to appearing in the accompanying video. Meanwhile, Williams, Hugo, and Shay Haley instituted N.E.R.D., an outlet for hybrids of rock, rap, soul, and funk that didn\\'t conform with any particular radio format. In Search Of..., the debut N.E.R.D. album, was originally released in Europe in 2001, but when it arrived in the U.S. the following year, much of its electronic components had been replaced with live instrumentation, affirming Williams\\' and Hugo\\'s desire to evade creative restrictions. Although In Search Of... wasn\\'t met with the same level of success as most of the synchronous Neptunes productions, the album enabled Williams to extend his reach as a frontperson, and cleared a path to his first solo single in 2003. Produced with Hugo and featuring Jay-Z, \"Frontin\\'\" built anticipation for The Neptunes Present...Clones, a compilation of all-new tracks from artists produced by Williams and Hugo, released on their Interscope-affiliated Star Trak label. The track sent the parent album to the top of the Billboard 200 and eventually reached number five on the Hot 100, thus maintaining the duo\\'s momentum up to the release of N.E.R.D.\\'s second album, Fly or Die, in 2004. Neptunes\\' highlights across the remainder of that year and throughout 2005 included Snoop Dogg\\'s \"Drop It Like It\\'s Hot\" and Gwen Stefani\\'s \"Hollaback Girl,\" both of which topped the Hot 100. After a number of delays, Williams\\' first solo album, In My Mind, arrived in 2006. Produced by Williams alone, it featured appearances from several of his previous collaborators and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 chart.Williams didn\\'t release another solo album for eight years, but his name, as well as that of the Neptunes, continued to be of high value. Successful collaborations with the likes of Mariah Carey (\"Say Somethin\\'\"), Beyoncé (\"Green Light\"), Jay-Z (\"I Know\"), Solange (\"I Decided\"), and Madonna (\"Give It 2 Me\") continued through the latter half of the 2000s. There was a handful of Grammy nominations, as well as a win for Ludacris\\' \"Money Maker,\" which took the Best Rap Song award for 2006. N.E.R.D. remained an occasional diversion with 2008\\'s Seeing Sounds in 2010\\'s Nothing, the latter released the same year as the animated comedy Despicable Me, for which Williams provided soundtrack material and co-composed the score. During 2011 and 2012, Williams produced material for dozens of projects, most notably Kendrick Lamar\\'s Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City and Frank Ocean\\'s Channel Orange, two of the era\\'s landmark albums.The roll continued through 2013 and 2014. \"Blurred Lines,\" a number one pop hit for Robin Thicke, involved Williams as producer, co-songwriter, and featured artist. Williams co-wrote and fronted \"Get Lucky\" and \"Lose Yourself to Dance,\" two songs from Daft Punk\\'s chart-topping Random Access Memories. The soundtrack for Despicable Me 2 contained several Williams songs, led by the worldwide smash hit \"Happy,\" a ubiquitous soul-pop throwback for which Williams conceived a 24-hour music video. When the nominees for the 2013 Grammy Awards were announced, Williams\\' name appeared in seven categories. At the ceremony the following January, \"Get Lucky\" won Record of the Year and Random Access Memories won Album of the Year. Williams also took the award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. Two months later, signed as a solo artist to Columbia, home of Daft Punk, Williams released his second album, G I R L. It reached number two on the Billboard 200, by which time \"Happy\" had achieved yet more success, becoming one of the top-selling digital singles of all time with sales of more than five million. In addition, Williams continued hit-making as a featured artist and producer with singles such as Future\\'s \"Move That Dope,\" Alicia Keys\\' \"It\\'s On Again,\" and Ed Sheeran\\'s \"Sing,\" and he joined the television singing competition The Voice as a judge.Williams was as busy and relevant as ever during the latter half of the 2010s. Among his biggest hits during this period were Kendrick Lamar\\'s Grammy-winning \"Alright,\" Missy Elliott\\'s Top Ten R&amp;B/hip-hop return \"WTF (Where They From),\" and Camila Cabello\\'s number one pop hit \"Havana.\" He also contributed to high-profile albums by Alicia Keys, Frank Ocean, Little Big Town, Calvin Harris, SZA, Janelle Monáe, and Justin Timberlake, as well as Beyoncé and Jay-Z\\'s duo recording as the Carters. Williams\\' Hollywood connections concurrently deepened with musical contributions to The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Paddington, and SpongeBob Squarepants: Sponge Out of Water, the last of which featured new N.E.R.D. material. For Hidden Figures, Williams not only contributed original music for the soundtrack and Golden Globe-nominated score but co-produced the film, itself an Academy Awards nominee for 2016\\'s Best Picture. In 2017, Williams reunited with the Despicable Me team for the third installment in the series, and made a full return with Hugo and Haley as N.E.R.D., who scored their first Top 40 pop hit with the rowdy Rihanna collaboration \"Lemon,\" and released their fifth album, NO ONE EVER REALLY DIES. He continued to work actively with other artists, writing and producer Migos\\' 2018 hit, \"Stir Fry,\" and working again with the Carters on their single, \"Apeshit.\" He landed his own hit that same year with \"Sangria Wine,\" a collaboration with Camila Cabello. In June 2019, Williams contributed the track \"Letter to My Godfather\" to the Clarence Avant documentary The Black Godfather. Another soundtrack song, \"Just a Cloud Away,\" arrived in 2022 as part of Despicable Me 2, after which Williams released the song \"Cash In Cash Out,\" featuring Tyler, The Creator and 21 Savage. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi'\n",

      "'Grounded in hip-hop yet never averse to pop, Mark Ronson has applied his voracious musical obsessions to become one of the most commercially successful producers from the mid-2000s onward. The DJ-turned-recording artist made his true solo debut with \"Ooh Wee\" (2003), a collaboration with Ghostface Killah and Nate Dogg that went Top 20 in his native U.K., but he truly set himself apart as the co-producer of Amy Winehouse\\'s throwback-styled Back to Black (2006), a global smash that earned him his first three Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year. Ronson\\'s subsequent solo albums, all stocked with high-profile guest appearances, have either crowned or nearly topped the U.K. charts. Uptown Special (2015) was particularly fruitful -- and a Top Five pop, Grammy-winning LP in the U.S. -- driven by the Bruno Mars-fronted \"Uptown Funk,\" another international hit that earned multiple Recording Academy nods itself. Ronson has since produced material for Lady Gaga (Joanne and the Grammy-winning \"Shallow\") and Queens of the Stone Age (Villains), teamed up with Diplo as Silk City (the Grammy-winning \"Electricity\"), and returned as a solo headliner with Late Night Feelings (2019). Ever collaborative, he paired with Raissa Khan-Panni for \"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\" (2020) and Diplo for \"New Love\" (2021). He also served as executive producer on the soundtrack to the hit Barbie movie in 2023.The son of Laurence Ronson, who managed Bucks Fizz, and the stepson of Foreigner\\'s Mick Jones, Mark Ronson spent the first eight years of his life in England. He started playing guitar and drums at an early age and fell particularly hard for hip-hop, including Run-D.M.C. and the Beastie Boys. Around his mid-teens, after he and mother had relocated to New York, Ronson began listening to DJ mixtapes and was inspired enough to seize his father\\'s record collection and try his hand at mixing. A quick study with a level of eclecticism that belied his age, Ronson soon caught the ears and eyes of various socialites and New York celebrities, including fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, who featured Ronson, along with other sons and daughters of celebrities, in a 1997 fashion campaign. A year later, hip-hop mogul Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs hired Ronson to spin records at his 29th birthday bash. These and other high-profile gigs boosted Ronson\\'s profile and helped advance his fledgling music career, which continued modestly with some underground beatmaking, a role in the Flip Squad All-Star DJs (a collective that released a self-titled album for MCA in 1998), and sessions with the likes of Nikka Costa and Sean Paul. Combining his various talents, budding songwriting ability, and growing list of contacts, Ronson embarked on his first solo album project with support from major-label Elektra. He enlisted artists ranging from Sean Paul and Mos Def to Jack White and Rivers Cuomo, and made his debut in 2003 with Here Comes the Fuzz. The album fared best in the U.K., where the single \"Ooh Wee,\" assisted by Ghostface Killah, Nate Dogg, Saigon, and Trife, became a number 15 hit. The LP was eventually certified silver by the BPI.Ronson kept busy behind the scenes and was in full stride during 2006 and 2007. He scored with Christina Aguilera\\'s \"Hurt\" (number 11 U.K., number 19 U.S.) and Lily Allen\\'s \"Littlest Things\" (number 21 U.K.), and had a hand in Rhymefest\\'s Blue Collar (number ten U.S. R&amp;B/hip-hop), which he released through his J Records-affiliated Allido label. These significant achievements paled in comparison to where he went during the same period with Amy Winehouse. Though the production load of Back to Black, Winehouse\\'s 2006 blockbuster, was almost evenly divided between Ronson and Salaam Remi, the former was responsible for most of the singles, including \"Rehab\" (number seven U.K., number nine U.S.) and \"Back to Black\" (number eight U.K.). At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards, Back to Black won Best Pop Vocal Album, \"Rehab\" took Record of the Year, and Ronson was hailed as Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. Capitalizing upon the momentum, Ronson followed up in 2007 with his second album, Version, on which the likes of Winehouse, Allen, and Robbie Williams helped him reimagine mostly contemporary British material. It narrowly missed the top of the U.K. album chart (and later achieved double-platinum status), with the Daniel Merriweather collaboration \"Stop Me,\" a melding of classics by the Smiths and the Supremes, as its biggest single (number two U.K.). Between solo releases, Ronson added to his list of hit productions with Adele\\'s \"Cold Shoulder\" (number 18 U.K.) and Merriweather\\'s \"Change\" (number eight U.K.), and continued to cross genres and bridge generations as he aided Solange, Bebel Gilberto, Foreigner, Wale, the Like, and Quincy Jones.Ronson himself entered the U.K. album chart a second time at number two with Record Collection, a 2010 set credited to Mark Ronson &amp; the Business Intl. The producer\\'s third LP -- and the first on which he sang -- led off with the number six U.K. hit \"Bang Bang Bang,\" featuring MNDR and Q-Tip, and boasted a previously unthinkable pairing, Simon LeBon and Wiley, on the title song. Ronson deepened his association with LeBon as the producer of Duran Duran\\'s All You Need Is Now, provided music for the film Arthur, and then produced the majority of Black Lips\\' Arabia Mountain. Ronson\\'s longest between-albums phase yet was then highlighted by the co-production of Bruno Mars\\' 2012 hit \"Locked Out of Heaven\" (number two U.K., number one U.S.), a Grammy nominee for Record of the Year. Additional studio time with Paul McCartney and the Ghost of a Saber Tooth Tiger preceded Ronson\\'s November 2014 return with another Mars meeting, \"Uptown Funk,\" which topped charts across Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and elsewhere. Eventually certified diamond platinum in the States, \"Uptown Funk\" anchored Uptown Special, Ronson\\'s fourth album, issued in January 2015. Featuring lyrics written by novelist Michael Chabon and additional featured performances from Kevin Parker (Tame Impala), James Ford (Simian Mobile Disco), and Mystikal, Uptown Special topped the U.K. chart and entered the Billboard 200 at number five. The 2015 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance went to \"Uptown Funk.\"The wait for Ronson\\'s fifth album exceeded four years, but the producer remained occupied during this intermediary phase. Throughout the remainder of 2015 alone, he placed credits on albums from Elle King, Action Bronson, A$AP Rocky, Duran Duran, Cee Lo Green, and Adele. He was also involved in the making of the documentary Amy, the music of which was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media. During 2016 and 2017, his primary projects were Lady Gaga\\'s Joanne and Queens of the Stone Age\\'s Villains. He co-produced the entirety of the Gaga LP, which topped the Billboard 200, and carried out the principal production duties for Villains. In 2018, Ronson partnered with fellow production superstar Diplo as Silk City and released the track \"Electricity\" featuring Dua Lipa. The song went to number four in the U.K. and topped the dance chart in the U.S. That same year, he also co-wrote \"Shallow,\" the lead single from the Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper vehicle A Star Is Born. Both songs were cross-continental hits, and by the end of the year \"Electricity\" had won the Grammy for Best Dance Recording while \"Shallow\" had taken home both the Grammy for Best Song Written for Visual Media and the Academy Award for Best Original Song.On the heels of his awards-season success, Ronson released the single \"Nothing Breaks Like a Heart,\" featuring Miley Cyrus. A number two hit in the U.K., it recalled Dolly Parton\\'s disco crossover bids and previewed the \"sad bangers\" approach of his fifth studio album, Late Night Feelings. Released in June 2019, the set also included collaborations with Lykke Li, Camila Cabello, King Princess, and others. It reached number four in the U.K. and 61 on the Billboard 200. A non-album single, \"I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight\" featuring Raissa Khan-Panni, arrived in 2020 before Ronson rejoined Diplo for the 2021 Silk City track \"New Love\" featuring Ellie Goulding. Also in 2021, he hosted the Apple TV+ documentary series Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson. A non-album track, \"Too Much\" (featuring Lucky Daye), arrived the following year. In 2023, Ronson served as the executive producer of Barbie: The Album and contributed both production and songwriting to several of the film\\'s songs, including \"Dance the Night\" and \"I\\'m Just Ken,\" among others. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi'\n",

By the time he was a teenager, however, he had switched to piano and began performing at his high school. He enrolled in Grant MacEwan College in Edmonton, Alberta, where he studied music, dropping out after two years due to difficulties on account of his dyslexia. After his debut release, he toured Europe, performing at the Berlin Live 8 concert in the summer of 2005. His U.S. release of Daniel Powter came out in 2006. The lead single from the album, \"Bad Day\" became the theme to the fifth season of FOX\\'s television singing competition American Idol and Powter even performed the song live during the season finale. A colossal hit, \"Bad Day\" eventually reached number on on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as many other charts worldwide. In 2008, he released his third offering, Under the Radar, which included the single \"Next Plane Home.\" While garnering relatively positive reviews, the album did not achieve the same level of attention enjoyed by its predecessor. It seemed as if the popularity and ubiquity of \"Bad Day\" was so great that it threatened to overshadow Powter\\'s subsequent work and it took the singer a few years to come to terms with his success. During this time, Powter continued to write and perform and even recorded piano parts for Marcy Playground\\'s 2009 release Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage. In 2010, Warner Bros. released the compilation album, Best of Me which included four new songs from Powter.

      "'Following the success of JLS and the Wanted, X-Factor contestants One Direction were the next group of heartthrobs to help revive the boy band concept. The quintet outdid all of its predecessors, becoming the biggest boy band since Take That, selling millions of albums and singles, filling arenas and making movies, all while hitting number one many times over across the world with undeniably hooky songs and plenty of boy-next-door charm.The group was formed by Niall Horan from Mullingar, Ireland; Zayn Malik from Bradford; Harry Styles from Cheshire; Louis Tomlinson from Doncaster, and Liam Payne from Wolverhampton (the latter had previously reached the judge\\'s house stages of The X-Factor as a 14-year-old back in 2008). Each originally entered 2010\\'s seventh series of The X Factor as individuals, but following a suggestion from guest judge Nicole Scherzinger, they were grouped together to become One Direction. Mentored by Simon Cowell, they soon became one of the favorites to win the show, thanks to renditions of Kelly Clarkson\\'s \"My Life Would Suck Without You,\" Elton John\\'s \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight,\" and Bonnie Tyler\\'s \"Total Eclipse of the Heart.\" However, despite receiving a standing ovation for their duet with Robbie Williams (\"She\\'s the One\") in the live final, they eventually finished third behind Rebecca Ferguson and winner Matt Cardle. Spotting the potential of five Justin Bieber-esque teen pin-ups, Cowell signed them to his Syco label in a two-million dollar deal, and after performing on the X-Factor tour, the quintet began work on its debut album with Savan Kotecha (Britney Spears, Enrique Iglesias). Following a sponsorship deal with Nintendo DS and a book, Forever Young, named after their cover of the Alphaville classic that was intended to be their winner\\'s song, they released their first single, \"What Makes You Beautiful,\" in late 2011. The full-length album Up All Night followed soon after. In 2012, One Direction became the first British band to debut on top of the Billboard 200 list when Up All Night sold over 176,000 copies during its first week of release in America.In late 2012, One Direction released their sophomore album, Take Me Home. Highlighting more of the band\\'s melodic pop, Take Me Home featured songs and production from Sweden\\'s Carl Falk, Rami Yacoub, and Savan Kotecha, who worked on Up All Night, as well as contributions from singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran. The album proved to be another smash and topped charts around the world, earning multi-platinum certification in half-a-dozen countries. The singles \"Live While We\\'re Young\" and \"Little Things\" also hit number one across the globe, and \"Kiss You\" reached the Top Ten in the U.S.One Direction then embarked on a globe-spanning tour in which the band played over 100 shows, including six sold-out nights at London\\'s massive O2 Arena. At the same time, they were being filmed by director Morgan Spurlock for This Is Us, a mix of documentary and concert footage that proved to be successful at the box office when it was released in August of 2013. While they were touring, One Direction also began work on their third album, Midnight Memories. Released just in time for the 2013 holidays, the record featured songwriting input from all the members, a new production team, and some new folk and \\'80s hair metal influences. It nearly outdid Take Me Home and Up All Night, peaking at number one in seven countries and spawning the singles \"Best Song Ever\" and \"Story of My Life.\" The group toured the world for most of 2014, but still found time to record a fourth album, which was released in late 2014. Produced by the same team who handled Midnight Memories, Four similarly looked back to the \\'80s for inspiration and featured a new song from old friend Ed Sheeran. A pair of platinum singles, \"Steal My Girl\" and \"Night Changes,\" helped the album hit number one in nearly 20 countries.The band returned to the road and a busy promotional schedule in 2015, during which Malik was often absent. He left the tour due to stress in early March, then officially quit the band a few days later. (He went on to become the first to pursue a solo career.) The four remaining members continued touring, and in July released \"Drag Me Down,\" the first single from their fifth album, Made in the A.M. Following the September announcement of the album, the bandmembers also revealed that, after the promotional efforts for the album were over, they\\'d be going on hiatus during 2016. Made in the A.M. was released in November of 2015, and featured the singles \"Infinity,\" \"Perfect,\" \"What a Feeling,\" and \"History.\" It performed very well commercially, peaking at number one in the U.K. and number two in the U.S. ~ Jon O\\'Brien, Rovi'\n",

      "'As they evolved from \\'90s French house pioneers to 2000s dance tastemakers to mainstream heroes in the 2010s, Daft Punk remained one of dance music\\'s most iconic acts. With their early singles and 1997\\'s instant-classic debut album Homework, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter quickly won acclaim for their skill at blending their beloved Chicago house and Detroit techno with pop, funk, indie rock, and hip-hop into nostalgic yet futuristic forms. Not content to just widen electronic music\\'s popularity, on 2001\\'s Discovery they reinvented the then-unfashionable sounds of mid-\\'80s soft rock and R&amp;B into stylish tracks that also had a childlike wonder. Despite their sizable popularity, Daft Punk were never afraid to challenge their listeners, which they did with 2005\\'s cold and dystopic Human After All. Even when they polarized their audience, there was never any doubt that they staged groundbreaking concerts, and the tour captured on Alive 2007 helped pave the way for arena-sized EDM, particularly in the U.S. With 2013\\'s Random Access Memories, the duo once again looked to the past to create the future, borrowing from prog, disco, and a laid-back West Coast vibe that bucked the predominant trends in electronic music but still resonated with a wide audience. Daft Punk\\'s influence reached further into the mainstream through collaborations with Kanye West and the Weeknd, and the duo\\'s music was sampled by artists ranging from Missy Elliott to the Fall. Though they reinvented themselves continually, wherever Daft Punk went, the rest of pop music followed. After meeting in 1987 as students at Paris\\' Lycée Carnot secondary school, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo became friends and soon started making music together. In 1992, they formed the band Darlin\\'. Named after a Beach Boys song, the group featured Bangalter on bass, de Homem-Christo on guitar, and additional guitarist Laurent Brancowitz. Darlin\\'s career was brief: The trio recorded a cover of their namesake song that appeared, along with an original song, on a various artists EP released by Stereolab\\'s label Duophonic (the band also invited Darlin\\' to play some U.K. shows with them). Following a Melody Maker review that described Darlin\\'s music as \"a daft punky thrash,\" the band broke up. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo began experimenting with electronic music, taking their new project\\'s name from that review and drawing inspiration from pioneers such as Todd Edwards, Juan Atkins, Kraftwerk, Frankie Knuckles, and many more. By September 1993, Daft Punk had readied a demo tape, which they gave to Soma co-founder Stuart MacMillan at a rave at EuroDisney. The label released the duo\\'s debut single, \"The New Wave,\" in April 1994. Instantly hailed by the dance music press as the work of a new breed of house innovators, it was followed by May 1995\\'s \"Da Funk,\" the band\\'s first true hit (the record sold 30,000 copies worldwide and saw thorough rinsings by everyone from Kris Needs to the Chemical Brothers). In 1996, the buzz around Daft Punk led them to sign with Virgin, and the label released the single \"Da Funk\"/\"Musique\" that year. Recorded and mixed at the duo\\'s Paris studio Daft House, January 1997\\'s debut album Homework -- named for Daft Punk\\'s D.I.Y. aesthetic -- was a critical and commercial success. The album reached number three in France and stayed on the chart for over a year, while the singles \"Da Funk,\" \"Around the World,\" \"Burnin\\',\" and \"Revolution 909\" charted in France, the U.K., the U.S., and Australia. The duo supported the record with the Daftendirekt tour, while the Homework video collection D.A.F.T.: A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes followed in 1999 and featured clips directed by Roman Coppola, Michel Gondry, and Spike Jonze.To follow their breakthrough debut album, de Homem-Christo and Bangalter reached back to their childhoods in the \\'70s and \\'80s and sought to fuse technology with humanity. Once again recorded at Daft House, March 2001\\'s Discovery incorporated disco and synth pop as well as house, garage, and R&amp;B into a sleek, retro-futuristic sound that matched the robotic helmets and gloves the duo introduced with the release of the album. Featuring contributions from heroes such as Romanthony, Edwards, and DJ Sneak, Discovery was an even bigger hit than its predecessor. The album peaked at number two in France and the U.K., while the singles \"One More Time,\" \"Digital Love,\" \"Harder, Faster, Better, Stronger,\" and \"Face to Face\" also charted in the U.K. and the U.S. That November saw the release of Alive 1997, an edit of the duo\\'s Birmingham, England stop on the Daftendirekt tour. Daft Punk capped the Discovery era in 2003 with Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, an animated film they produced with anime and manga creator Leiji Matsumoto that used the album as its soundtrack. For Daft Punk\\'s third album, the duo took a drastically different approach. Created in six weeks -- as opposed to the two years they spent making Discovery -- with a handful of gear that included an eight-track machine, March 2005\\'s Human After All was a deliberately raw, stark set of songs inspired by George Orwell\\'s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Though its cold, repetitive feel drew polarized reactions, the album fared well commercially: Human After All reached number three in France, was a Top Ten hit in the U.K., and hit number one on the Billboard Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart in the U.S. The set was also nominated for Best Electronic/Dance Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards. Shortly after its release, Human After All [Remixes] collected reworkings by Soulwax, Digitalism, and Erol Alkan among others. April 2006 saw the arrival of Musique, Vol. 1: 1993-2005, a compilation of the duo\\'s best-known songs and remixes accompanied by the videos for Human After All\\'s singles. That May, Daft Punk premiered their film Electroma at the Director\\'s Fortnight at that year\\'s Cannes Film Festival. An experimental sci-fi film about a pair of robots seeking to become human, it began as the video for Human After All\\'s title track before expanding into a feature film (unlike Interstella 5555, the movie did not feature any of Daft Punk\\'s music). Initially earning mixed reviews, over time Electroma won a cult audience. That year, the duo embarked on the Alive tour, which lasted through 2007 and featured some of Daft Punk\\'s most ambitiously staged live sets. Appearing in November 2007, Alive 2007 documented the tour. Early in 2009, the album and its single \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" won Grammy Awards. Daft Punk returned with new music in November 2010 in the form of the score to Joseph Kosinski\\'s feature film Tron: Legacy. A collaboration with Joseph Trapanese, who arranged and orchestrated the pair\\'s compositions, it featured an 85-piece orchestra as well as Daft Punk\\'s signature electronics. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo also appeared in the film in a brief cameo. The soundtrack eventually reached number four on the Billboard 200 Albums chart in the U.S. and was nominated for a Best Score Soundtrack Album for Visual Media Grammy Award. Also in 2010, the duo were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, with de Homem-Christo and Bangalter each receiving the rank of Chevalier. The following year saw the April release of the remix album Tron: Legacy Reconfigured, while that September\\'s compilation Soma Records: 20 Years featured the track \"Drive,\" an early recording that was believed to be lost. For their fourth album, Daft Punk once again took a different creative tack. Seeking a breezy feel informed by Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, and Jean Michel Jarre, the duo emphasized live instrumentation and collaborated with artists including Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, Giorgio Moroder, and Panda Bear. Pharrell Williams appeared on the single \"Get Lucky,\" which preceded the release of the full-length Random Access Memories in May 2013. Recorded in California, New York City, and Paris and spanning disco, prog, and indie influences, the album became one of Daft Punk\\'s biggest successes. It topped the charts in over 20 countries including the U.S., where it became the duo\\'s first number one album and was eventually certified platinum. It also won Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronica Album, Album of the Year, and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. \"Get Lucky\" hit number one in over 30 countries and earned Grammys for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Record of the Year. That year, Daft Punk also co-produced Kanye West\\'s critically acclaimed album Yeezus, and worked on tracks including the single \"Black Skinhead.\" In 2014, the duo appeared on Pharrell\\'s album G I R L and collaborated with Jay-Z on the song \"Computerized.\" A 2015 documentary titled Daft Punk Unchained charted their history from the \\'90s into the 2010s, featuring interviews with Rodgers, Pharrell, and West, among others. In turn, the duo appeared in that year\\'s Rodgers documentary Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk.During the latter half of the 2010s, Daft Punk remained active. They teamed up with the Weeknd\\'s Abel Tesfaye on a pair of songs from his 2016 album Starboy, including the chart-topping title track. The following year, the duo performed with the Weeknd at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards; later in 2017, they co-wrote and produced Parcels\\' \"Overnight.\" During this time, Daft Punk\\'s members also worked on separate projects. Bangalter co-produced Arcade Fire\\'s 2017 album Everything Now and contributed pieces to the soundtrack to Gaspar Noé\\'s 2018 film Climax, while de Homem-Christo co-wrote and produced tracks for Charlotte Gainsbourg\\'s 2017 album Rest and the Weeknd\\'s 2018 EP My Dear Melancholy,. In 2019, Daft Punk were featured in the Philharmonie de Paris\\' exhibition Electro, which traced the history of electronic music and its influence on visual arts. In February 2021, the duo disbanded, spreading the news with a YouTube video that featured scenes from the end of Electroma. ~ Heather Phares &amp; Sean Cooper, Rovi'\n",

      "'Gwen Stefani parlayed her breakout stardom as the effervescent lead singer of the SoCal ska-punk outfit No Doubt into an enduring career as a pop star. Before going solo, Stefani reached the top of the charts many times during No Doubt\\'s peak. \"Spiderwebs,\" \"Just a Girl,\" and the ballad \"Don\\'t Speak\" -- all pulled from their 1995 album Tragic Kingdom -- were iconic alternative rock hits. The early-2000s smashes \"Hey Baby,\" \"Hella Good,\" and \"Underneath It All\" found the group dabbling in pop, dance, and R&amp;B, a musical expansion that coincided with Stefani stepping outside of the band as a featured vocalist on the hits \"South Side\" by techno superstar Moby and \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\" by the rapper Eve. All this extracurricular activity helped set up the launch of Stefani\\'s solo career in 2004 with the album Love.Angel.Music.Baby., a platinum blockbuster that gave her a number one single with the thumping Neptunes collaboration \"Hollaback Girl,\" plus the hits \"Cool,\" \"What You Waiting For?,\" and \"Rich Girl,\" the latter a reunion with Eve. The 2006 record The Sweet Escape consolidated her pop success thanks to the Top Tens \"Wind It Up\" and \"The Sweet Escape,\" but by that point, Stefani began to venture outside of music. She launched her fashion line L.A.M.B. in 2004, a pursuit she\\'d develop over the coming decade. She started to dabble in film, an interest that eventually led her to joining the televised singing competition The Voice in 2014. Music remained essential to Stefani\\'s appeal -- she reunited with No Doubt on occasion in addition to returning to her solo career with This Is What the Truth Feels Like, an album released a decade after The Sweet Escape, and later singles such as 2023\\'s \"True Babe\" that reinforced her ska-crossover legacy -- yet her position on The Voice underscored how multifaceted she is, a star who shines upon every aspect of the entertainment industry. Born and raised in Fullerton, California, Stefani had a musical epiphany at the age of 17. She had fallen in love with the Madness and Selecter records her brother Eric was constantly spinning. Seeing Fishbone, the Untouchables, and other bands involved in Los Angeles\\' ska revival scene only reinforced her interest, so she was more than ready when her brother asked her to join a ska band he was forming with a friend named John Spence. Gwen originally shared lead vocals with Spence, but in December of 1987 he committed suicide, leaving the band -- now called No Doubt -- with an uncertain future. According to many interviews with the bandmembers after their breakthrough, Gwen was the glue that held No Doubt together during these hard times, pushing the group to keep trying. She was also romantically involved with the band\\'s bass player, Tony Kanal, by this time. After playing numerous gigs and parties, No Doubt were signed to Interscope in 1991. The label considered their 1992 debut album a flop and refused to financially support a tour or further recordings, but the band refused to give up. The self-financed Beacon Street Collection appeared in 1994 and did well enough to make nice with Interscope, but the band was once again going through a traumatic period behind the scenes. Eric Stefani left to become an animator for The Simpsons and Gwen and Tony\\'s relationship had ended. Gwen wrote a collection of songs focused on heartbreak and rebirth that would become No Doubt\\'s third album, Tragic Kingdom, and the rest, as they say, is history. With the smash singles \"Just a Girl,\" \"Spiderwebs,\" and \"Don\\'t Speak,\" the album reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 and garnered two Grammy nominations. The press began to focus on Stefani\\'s role in the band. Voted one of People magazine\\'s \"50 Most Beautiful People,\" video and photo shoots focused on her and rumors spread that the other three members of the band were unhappy with the lack of attention they received. This topic of discussion continued as the band released Return of Saturn in 2000 and the heavily reggae-influenced hit album Rock Steady a year later. During this time, Stefani\\'s romantic relationship with Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale became a frequent topic of No Doubt\\'s songs. The pair married on September 14, 2002. She also started doing some work outside the band, lending her vocals to the remix of Moby\\'s \"Southside\" and rapper Eve\\'s \"Let Me Blow Your Mind.\"After Rock Steady, No Doubt took a break. Stefani approached Kanal about producing an off-the-cuff solo project that would be influenced by her non-ska favorites. Prince, the Time, Club Nouveau, and Madonna were the names thrown around and the idea was to make the project \"fast and easy.\" Over time, the \"fast and easy\" record morphed into something much bigger. Old friend, former labelmate, and hit songwriter Linda Perry became involved and the project became much more polished, slick, and dance-oriented. A pile of high-profile collaborators -- Dr. Dre, the Neptunes, Dallas Austin, Andre 3000, Nellee Hooper, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis -- became involved. In September of 2004, the infectious and hyper dance single \"What You Waiting For?\" appeared, with its accompanying video dominating MTV. The album, Love.Angel.Music.Baby., hit the shelves in November with surreal artwork that introduced Stefani\\'s four-woman \"posse,\" the Harajuku Girls. The all-Asian Harajuku Girls were inspired by Stefani\\'s fascination with the Harajuku girls of Japan, young club kids with a flippant and fun attitude toward fashion. Appearing with Stefani live, in videos, and in photos, the Girls quickly drew criticism from the Asian community, angry about the rumor that they had to sign a contract to never speak English even though they could, and that Stefani\\'s Girls looked nothing like the \"real\" Harajuku girls. Nonetheless, the album was a hit and continued to roll out singles. Based on a dancehall cover of Fiddler on the Roof\\'s \"If I Were a Rich Man,\" \"Rich Girl\" became the next smash, reuniting Stefani with Eve. The cheerleader kiss-off anthem \"Hollaback Girl\" was the third success. While the singles were dominating pop and dance radio, Stefani appeared as Jean Harlow in Martin Scorsese\\'s The Aviator. With music and movies checked off, Stefani moved into the world of fashion and introduced her clothing line, L.A.M.B. Taking her influence to the world of tech, she designed the Harajuku Lovers\\' 4.1 MP Digital Camera for Hewlett-Packard. The camera was released in a limited edition with a Stefani-designed case and a biographical DVD. Late in 2005, Stefani discovered she was pregnant with her first child, but her schedule remained busy in 2006: along with working on L.A.M.B., she released a line of limited-edition fashion dolls complete with outfits from her videos and tours, and worked on her second solo album with producers including Akon, Swizz Beatz, Tim Rice-Oxley of Keane, Nellee Hooper, the Neptunes, and Tony Kanal. That spring, Stefani gave birth to a boy. The Neptunes-produced, Sound of Music-sampling \"Wind It Up\" arrived later that fall and heralded the full-length The Sweet Escape, which was released on the same day as the live DVD Harajuku Lovers Live.No Doubt announced a return to the studio in 2008, but progress slowed to a crawl as the band experienced a bout of writer\\'s block and the Rossdale-Stefani family continued to grow with their second child, Zuma Nesta Rock. The band maintained their momentum by touring through 2009. No Doubt eventually released Push and Shove in 2012, featuring a mix of Rock Steady-esque dancehall bangers and new wave ballads similar to Stefani\\'s solo material. In February 2014, Stefani and Rossdale had their third boy, Apollo Bowie Flynn. Later that year, Stefani joined the judges panel on The Voice with her friend Pharrell, opening the pair to a number of subsequent collaborations. Stefani lent her vocals to fellow Voice coach Adam Levine for Maroon 5\\'s \"My Heart Is Open.\" She also appeared on tracks with Calvin Harris and Snoop Dogg.By late 2014, Stefani was in the midst of a full-scale comeback, releasing a pair of singles: the Ryan Tedder/Benny Blanco-penned \"Baby Don\\'t Lie\" and another Pharrell production, \"Spark the Fire.\" The following year, she contributed the song \"Shine\" to the Paddington Bear movie soundtrack and a duet with Eminem on \"Kings Never Die\" from Southpaw. In August 2015, Stefani and Rossdale filed for divorce. A third song -- \"Used to Love You\" -- was released months later. It gained moderate airplay and was the only comeback single to be included on her third project, This Is What the Truth Feels Like, which was released in March 2016 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The second official single from the album, \"Make Me Like You,\" was accompanied by a video that Stefani recorded live during the 2016 Grammy Awards. Later that year, she provided the voice for the DJ Suki character in the animated movie Trolls and, along with Justin Timberlake, appeared on several songs from the film\\'s soundtrack. In September 2017, she released the seasonal album You Make It Feel Like Christmas, which featured a duet with her Voice co-star -- and new romantic partner -- Blake Shelton. Stefani duetted with Shelton on his 2020 single \"Nobody But You,\" a song featured on the compilation Fully Loaded: God\\'s Country, and added \"Here This Christmas\" to a reissue of You Make It Feel Like Christmas. At the end of the year, she returned to pop music with \"Let Me Reintroduce Myself,\" a single that built upon the effervescent sounds of No Doubt. Another single, the reggae-injected \"Slow Clap,\" followed in in March 2021, with a Saweetie-accompanied edition arriving a month later. Stefani and Shelton married in July. Still suggesting the sounds of decades prior, the June 2023, ska-inflected single \"True Babe\" came with the promise of a forthcoming solo album. ~ David Jeffries &amp; Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'\n",

      "'One of the most influential, critically-lauded, and controversial artists of the early 21st century, American rapper and producer Kanye West went from hip-hop beatmaker to worldwide hitmaker with a wildly successful solo career that counted an unbroken string of chart-topping, multi-platinum albums and nearly two-dozen Grammy Awards. His early 2000s production work quickly led to a major-label recording contract, yielding a classic trilogy comprised of 2004\\'s The College Dropout, 2005\\'s Late Registration, and 2007\\'s Graduation. With each successive album, he pushed the boundaries of hip-hop and soon entered a new phase of artistry with game changers such as 2008\\'s 808s &amp; Heartbreak, 2010\\'s widely-regarded magnum opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and 2013\\'s industrial-leaning foray Yeezus. Celebrity, tabloid headlines, and a changing artistic vision informed much of his next era, as the trappings of fame and inner turmoil became the focus of chart-toppers such as The Life of Pablo and Ye. He even released a gospel album, Jesus Is King, in 2019. As his outspoken personality and political statements began to eclipse his music into the 2020s, he still managed to top the charts and garner accolades with 2020\\'s exploratory Donda.A proud and vocal Chicagoan, West was actually born in Atlanta, moving to the Windy City with his English professor mother after his parents split when he was three years old. One of his major inspirations, Donda West helped shape young Kanye, taking him to China in the late \\'80s on education exchange and establishing a strong base that made him a top pupil in high school. However, his music dreams would eventually eclipse academics and he dropped out of college, setting the stage for his best-selling school trilogy. With guidance from local producer No I.D., West went on to learn the finer points of studio production, programming, and sampling, the latter technique becoming a hallmark of his early work. He first got his foot in the industry door in the late \\'90s, doing quite a bit of noteworthy production work for the likes of Jermaine Dupri, Foxy Brown, Mase, and Goodie Mob. However, it was West\\'s work for Roc-A-Fella at the dawn of the new millennium that took his career to the next level. Alongside fellow fresh talent Just Blaze, West became one of the Roc\\'s go-to producers, consistently delivering hot tracks to album after album. His star turn came on Jay-Z\\'s classic The Blueprint (2001) with album standouts \"Takeover\" and \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.).\" Both songs showcased West\\'s signature beatmaking style of the time, which was largely sample-based; in these cases, the former track appropriated snippets of the Doors\\' \"Five to One,\" while the latter sampled the Jackson 5\\'s \"I Want You Back.\" More high-profile productions followed, and before long, word spread that West was going to release an album of his own, on which he planned to rap as well as produce. Unfortunately, that effort was a long time coming, pushed back repeatedly until a car crash in 2002 threatened to end his solo career before it even started. The accident left him with a jaw wired shut during his weeks-long recovery. He capitalized on the traumatic experience by using it as the inspiration for \"Through the Wire\" (and its corresponding video), which would later become the lead single for his debut album, 2004\\'s The College Dropout. As the album was further delayed, West continued to create big hits for the likes of Talib Kweli (\"Get By\"), Ludacris (\"Stand Up\"), Jay-Z (\"\\'03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde\"), and Alicia Keys (\"You Don\\'t Know My Name\"). Then, just as \"Through the Wire\" was breaking big-time at the tail-end of 2003, another West song caught fire, a collaboration with Twista and actor Jamie Foxx called \"Slow Jamz,\" which gave the rapper/producer two simultaneously ubiquitous singles and a much-anticipated debut album. As with so many of West\\'s songs, the singles were driven by somewhat recognizable sample-based hooks: Chaka Khan\\'s \"Through the Fire\" in the case of \"Through the Wire\" and Luther Vandross\\' \"A House Is Not a Home\" in the case of \"Slow Jamz.\" During these early days, West paired his beats with tongue-twisting raps and outspoken confidence. With a backpack and brightly colored polo shirt, his dapper fashion sense set him apart from many of his peers, while his attitude often came across as boastful and egotistical. This flamboyance made for good press, something that West enjoyed, for better or worse, throughout the course of his career. In the wake of his breakout success, West earned a whopping ten nominations at the 47th annual Grammy Awards in early 2005. The College Dropout won the Best Rap Album award, \"Jesus Walks\" won Best Rap Song, and a songwriting credit on \"You Don\\'t Know My Name\" for Best R&amp;B Song award was shared with Alicia Keys and Harold Lilly. Later that year, West released his second solo album, Late Registration, which spawned a series of hit singles (\"Diamonds in Sierra Leone,\" \"Gold Digger,\" \"Heard \\'Em Say,\" \"Touch the Sky\"). The album topped the charts, as did the \"Gold Digger\" single, and Late Registration eventually won a Grammy for Rap Album of the Year. West\\'s production work continued more or less unabated during this time; particularly noteworthy were hits for Twista (\"Overnight Celebrity\"), Janet Jackson (\"I Want You\"), Brandy (\"Talk About Our Love\"), the Game (\"Dreams\"), Common (\"Go!\"), and Keyshia Cole (\"I Changed My Mind\"). West also founded his own label, GOOD Music (\"Getting Out Our Dreams\"), in conjunction with Sony BMG. The label\\'s inaugural release was John Legend\\'s Get Lifted (2004), followed one year later by Common\\'s Be. In addition to all of his studio work, West also toured internationally in support of Late Registration and released Late Orchestration: Live at Abbey Road Studios (2006) in commemoration.After retreating from the spotlight for some time, West returned to the forefront of the music world in 2007 with a series of album releases. Consequence\\'s Don\\'t Quit Your Day Job and Common\\'s Finding Forever, both released by GOOD, were chiefly produced by West; the latter proved to be particularly popular, topping the album chart upon its release in July. And then there was West\\'s third solo album, Graduation, which was promoted well in advance of its September 11 release (a memorable date that pitted Kanye against 50 Cent, who in one interview swore he would quit music if his own album, Curtis, wasn\\'t the top-seller). A pair of singles -- \"Can\\'t Tell Me Nothing\" and \"Stronger,\" the latter an interpolation of Daft Punk\\'s 2001 single \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" -- led the promotional push. It became his third consecutive chart-topping album, and its success culminated in eight Grammy nominations. West was the victor in four of the categories, and he performed two songs during the ceremony, including Late Registration\\'s \"Hey Mama,\" chosen in honor of his recently deceased mother. That loss, compounded by a breakup with his fiancée, informed 2008\\'s genre-busting landmark 808s &amp; Heartbreak, a major change of pace that saw West singing most of his emotionally pained lyrics with the assistance of Auto-Tune. The album went platinum, spawning Top Three hits \"Love Lockdown\" and \"Heartless,\" while influencing a generation of young rappers wanting to tap into their emotional sides. West toured internationally, even returning to China in 2008 for a stop on his Glow in the Dark Tour. However, after a headline-grabbing turn at the 2009 MTV Video Awards involving Taylor Swift, West retreated from the spotlight to record another album.In 2010, West emerged with his fifth work, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, which marked the start of a new era for the artist, one focused on fame, sex, and opulent production. Recorded in Hawaii, the star-studded set recruited a staggering number of guest vocal spots from the likes of Kid Cudi, Elton John, Rihanna, Bon Iver, Rick Ross, and RZA. Preceded by the bombastic, King Crimson-sampling single \"Power,\" Fantasy also included the Grammy-winning \"All of the Lights,\" fan favorite \"Runaway,\" and \"Monster,\" which featured a star-making turn by a young Nicki Minaj. A sprawling and audacious statement, it debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, won a Grammy for Best Rap Album, and also went multi-platinum. While the album was still hot, West recorded the aggressive and boast-heavy Watch the Throne with Jay-Z and numerous producers and songwriters. Billed as a set by the Throne, it was released in August 2011 and entered the Billboard Top 200 chart at number one. A trio of hit singles -- \"Otis,\" \"No Church in the Wild,\" and \"Ni**as in Paris\" -- climbed the charts and each won Grammy Awards, capping a dominant run for the rapper that resulted in 21 Grammys within just eight years.In September 2012, he released the GOOD Music collaboration album Cruel Summer, which featured artists such as Big Sean, Pusha T, and Lifted. Four singles (\"Mercy,\" \"Cold,\" \"New Flow,\" and \"Clique\") were released as promotion for the record. Toward the end of the year, there were rumblings from acclaimed producers that a new album would emerge soon. These murmurs were soon confirmed when West himself announced that he was working on his sixth album with the likes of Daft Punk, King L., Justin Vernon, Rick Rubin, Chief Keef, and many more contributing. As one of the most eagerly anticipated albums of 2013, the angry and aggressive Yeezus was released to rapturous reviews from critics. Incorporating industrial-electronic touches, screamed vocals, and soaring gospel, West touched upon both controversial and sensitive topics while delivering an astonishing and bold record, described as his most confrontational and bravest album to date. Despite leaking days before its official release, Yeezus still sold almost 327,000 copies during its first week and singles \"Black Skinhead\" and \"Bound 2\" were certified platinum while \"New Slaves\" received a Grammy nomination.The year 2013 also proved to be a personal milestone for West, as he became a father for the first time with partner Kim Kardashian. The following year, he announced a new album and released \"Only One\" featuring Paul McCartney, which, like his 2015 single \"FourFiveSeconds\" with McCartney and Rihanna, remained a non-LP release. Later, he announced another, different album, titled So Help Me God, which later turned to SWISH, then Waves, and finally The Life of Pablo. The album was released on Valentine\\'s Day 2016 and shot to the top of the Billboard 200. The guest list for the platinum-selling effort included Chance the Rapper, Kid Cudi, Young Thug, Chris Brown, Sia, the Weeknd, French Montana, Frank Ocean, Post Malone, Jay-Z, and many more. In the age of streaming and direct artist-to-fan access, West took advantage of the technology and continued to tinker with the album even after it was released, tweaking production, guest verses, and even lyrics.During the promotion of Pablo, West canceled the final dates of his revolutionary Saint Pablo Tour -- during which he performed from a \"floating\" stage suspended above the pit -- and was hospitalized for psychiatric observation. He retreated from the spotlight for nearly a year and re-emerged in 2017 to begin recording material for his next album -- as well as production for artists on his GOOD Music label -- at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While there, he also continued to court controversy with his political views and public statements made via social media. Amidst the headline flurry, he released a pair of singles in April 2018: \"Lift Yourself\" and \"Ye vs. the People\" with T.I. The following month, West delivered the first of the \"Wyoming Sessions\" studio productions with Pusha T\\'s critically acclaimed, Grammy-nominated Daytona. A week later, West released his eighth official set, Ye, which featured appearances by Kid Cudi, Ty Dolla $ign, and Nicki Minaj, as well as production by Mike Dean, Che Pope, Francis and the Lights, and Benny Blanco. Singles \"Yikes\" and \"All Mine\" were both certified platinum and hovered around the Top Ten on the Hot 100. The third installment of the series arrived the next week, marking the debut of the collaborative project Kids See Ghosts, a duo formed by West and Cudi. Kids See Ghosts featured Pusha T, Mos Def, and Ty Dolla $ign, as well as samples of Louis Prima and Kurt Cobain. West\\'s Wyoming Sessions were completed with the release of Nas\\' Nasir and Teyana Taylor\\'s K.T.S.E., and he received a nomination for Producer of the Year at the 2019 Grammy Awards.Following the flurry of activity in Wyoming, West released a pair of singles to close out the year. While the drug- and lust-filled \"XTCY\" was more of a B-side, its follow-up \"I Love It\" with Lil Pump took off on the charts and became a viral hit, boosted by a surreal music video and equally quirky live television performances. Certified double platinum, the song was West\\'s highest charting on the Hot 100 since 2015\\'s \"FourFiveSeconds.\" Riding the momentum of \"I Love It,\" West announced that another album was imminent. Like the pre-Pablo SWISH and Waves buildup, the proposed Yandhi -- a sequel to Yeezus -- never materialized and, in 2019, West revealed the album would be titled Jesus Is King. To promote the effort, he expanded his \"Sunday Service\" gospel revival events across the U.S., playing early versions of the album to fans in Detroit, Chicago, and New York City. Issued that October, Jesus Is King became West\\'s ninth straight number one studio album as a headliner. Singles \"Closed on Sunday\" and \"Follow God\" landed the rapper on multiple international charts, while the latter was certified gold in the U.S. A companion set from West\\'s Sunday Service Choir, Jesus Is Born, arrived on Christmas Day 2019. Although West\\'s vocals did not appear on the album, the crew intertwined their takes on tracks like \"Ultralight Beam\" and \"Father Stretch My Hands\" with their versions of beloved gospel songs by the Clark Sisters and Reverend Timothy Wright.Recording for West\\'s tenth album Donda began in early 2020. Named after his late mother, the release of Donda was surrounded by the same chaotic energy that encircled everything West was involved with at the time. Release dates were announced and pushed back, and after a listening party at Atlanta\\'s Mercedes Benz Stadium in late July of 2021, West took up residence in one of the stadium\\'s locker rooms to continue mixing and finalizing the recording of the album. Another listening party was scheduled around a new, tentative release date. The Grammy-nominated set finally arrived in August and entered number one in over a dozen countries. A sequel Donda 2 appeared in February of 2022, exclusively available as part of the Stem Player, a remix device and streaming platform developed by British company Kano Computing in collaboration with West. However, because the release was not made available to purchase or stream outside of the device, it was deemed ineligible for Billboard charts. Featuring the likes of Baby Keem, Migos, Jack Harlow, Alicia Keys, and many more, it reportedly managed to sell thousands of players, earning West millions. For the rest of the year, despite attempts to maintain a lower profile -- he pulled out of Coachella and Rolling Loud headline slots at the last minute -- West remained in the headlines with his continued controversial and inflammatory statements. ~ Andy Kellman &amp; Neil Z.

Born La\\'Reonte Wright in Flint, Michigan but raised in Las Vegas by a mother in the music business, Dizzy saw the life of a major-label artist firsthand while growing up, an experience that led him later in life to remain entirely indie. After a series of mixtapes filled with his smooth, Bone Thugs-influenced flow, Dizzy made it to the indies in 2012, specifically Hopsin\\'s Funk Volume imprint, which released his debut album, SmokeOut Conversations, on April 20 (4/20). The First Agreement EP followed on the label that same year, then 2013 saw the release of The Golden Age, a street-level mixtape that made the Billboard charts when it was officially released later in the year. In 2015 he dropped the single \"I Can Tell You Need It\" as a preview to that year\\'s LP The Growing Process. The album featured guest appearances from Big K.R.I.T., Tech N9ne, and Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. The Wisdom and Good Vibes EP followed in 2016. Later that year, he issued the 702 EP and a collaboration with Demrick titled Blaze with Us. Wright\\'s third full-length, The Golden Age 2, arrived in the summer of 2017, with State of Mind 2 dropping later that year. May 2019 saw the release of the single \"Vibes\", ahead of the arrival of the Don\\'t Tell Me It Can\\'t Be Done EP, which was issued the following month.

      "'A flexible powerhouse singer, songwriter, producer, and dancer, Beyoncé is a multifaceted global superstar by any measure. The Houstonian rose to fame in the late \\'90s as the central member of pop-R&amp;B group Destiny\\'s Child. The following decade, she started her ongoing streak of number one solo studio albums with Dangerously in Love (2003), the source of her first number one pop single, the ecstatic \"Crazy in Love.\" Nearly omnipresent hits such as the elegantly dismissive \"Irreplaceable\" (2006) and boisterous \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" (2008), combined with sold-out world tours and Grammy Awards, all heightened Beyoncé\\'s profile in the 2000s. Billboard named her female artist of the decade, while the RIAA acknowledged that, with 64 gold and platinum certifications, she was its top-selling artist. Beyoncé continued to diversify in the 2010s with the visual albums Beyoncé (2013) and Lemonade (2016), the latter of which she directed, followed by the Jay-Z collaboration Everything Is Love (2018) and her work on the remake of The Lion King (2019). The latter project was expanded with the soundtrack The Lion King: The Gift, executive-produced by Beyoncé, who also wrote and directed the related musical film Black Is King (2020). Beyoncé has since become the most awarded artist in Grammy history with Renaissance (2022), a cosmopolitan dancefloor celebration tying together gospel, disco, house, bounce, and Afrobeats with nods to ballroom culture and further proud affirmations of the singer\\'s Southern roots.Born in Houston, Beyoncé Giselle Knowles began performing at age seven, winning over 30 local competitions for her dancing and vocal abilities. She joined her cousin Kelly Rowland and classmates LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett in forming an adolescent vocal group. Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé\\'s father and Rowland\\'s legal guardian, signed on to be the girls\\' manager, eventually quitting his full-time job to focus on their efforts. This situation would ultimately lead to the creation of one of the most popular female R&amp;B groups of all time: Destiny\\'s Child.Destiny\\'s Child gained momentum throughout the \\'90s. They appeared on Star Search in 1992 (under the name Girls Tyme) and weathered several lineup changes before signing to Columbia in 1997. Four studio albums later, the group had officially become the best-selling female group of all time, with such smash hits as \"Jumpin\\' Jumpin\\',\" \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" \"Say My Name,\" and \"Survivor\" bolstering the young women\\'s momentum despite lawsuits from former members Roberson and Luckett. In 2001, Beyoncé, Rowland, and replacement member Michelle Williams allowed themselves a break from the group to pursue individual solo careers. Before landing several movie roles, Beyoncé became the first African-American female artist and second woman ever to win the annual ASCAP Pop Songwriter of the Year Award. An appearance in the MTV drama Carmen: A Hip Hopera quickly followed, but it was her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in 2002\\'s Austin Powers in Goldmember that established her as a true Hollywood star. While \"Work It Out,\" her inclusion on the movie\\'s soundtrack failed to chart in the U.S., it was a Top Ten hit in the U.K. Beyoncé\\'s full-length solo debut, 2003\\'s Dangerously in Love, reached multi-platinum status. Featuring collaborations with Sean Paul, Missy Elliott, OutKast\\'s Big Boi, and romantic interest Jay-Z, the album spawned a total of four Top Ten singles and garnered the singer five Grammys. Destiny\\'s Child reconvened the following year to release Destiny Fulfilled; upon completing the resulting tour, the group issued one final album, a greatest-hits compilation entitled #1\\'s, and subsequently disbanded. Beyoncé turned her full attention to her burgeoning solo career. She released B\\'day in September 2006 and, three months later, turned in an award-winning performance for the movie musical Dreamgirls. The singer then embarked on the Beyoncé Experience concert tour and released a live DVD in November 2007. The following year proved to be another busy one as Beyoncé landed the role of Etta James in Cadillac Records, a musical biopic that explored the heyday of Chicago\\'s Chess label. Shooting commenced in February 2008, with Beyoncé also serving as co-executive producer. One month before the film\\'s December release, the singer released her third studio album, I Am...Sasha Fierce. The double-disc effort emphasized her two distinct personalities, allowing Beyoncé to explore both mainstream sounds and traditional R&amp;B. Some live releases followed. Released in 2009, I Am...Yours, a CD/DVD set, documented an August 2009 performance at Wynn Las Vegas, while 2010\\'s I Am...World Tour, available in separate audio and video formats, was recorded at London\\'s significantly larger O2 Arena (a few months after the Vegas program). She followed ten Grammy nominations with 2011\\'s 4, which debuted at the top of the Billboard 200. One of her most energetic and empowering tracks, \"Run the World (Girls),\" was issued as the lead single, while \"Love on Top\" eventually won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance. Giving birth to Blue Ivy Carter in January 2012 didn\\'t slow her down. Within a few months, she was performing in Atlantic City, and she later appeared at President Barack Obama\\'s second inauguration. Joined by Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland, she headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. Life Is But a Dream, a documentary, first aired on HBO in February 2013, and was followed by appearances on albums by Rowland, the-Dream, and Jay-Z. New material, such as \"Bow Down\" and \"Standing on the Sun,\" trickled out without proper releases. Then, on December 13 -- with no preceding announcement -- Beyoncé released a self-titled visual album (a full-length studio recording with an accompanying video for each song). Her husband and daughter, along with Drake, Frank Ocean, and writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (via a sampled TED talk), made guest appearances. Beyoncé, assisted by the likes of Hit-Boy, Pharrell, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, and Miguel, co-wrote and co-produced the majority of the album\\'s material. Like Beyoncé\\'s four previous solo albums, it went to number one, and quickly went platinum in the U.S. Three months after she completed the Mrs. Carter Show world tour, she and Jay-Z embarked on the On the Run Tour, which reached the U.S., Canada, and France from June through September 2014. The following February, she was nominated for six Grammy Awards and won three, including Best R&amp;B Song and Best R&amp;B Performance, both for \"Drunk in Love.\" Although she didn\\'t release any new material in 2015, she co-wrote and appeared on Naughty Boy\\'s Top Five U.K. pop hit \"Runnin\\' (Lose It All),\" and contributed vocals to Coldplay\\'s \"Hymn for the Weekend.\" In February 2016, a new single, \"Formation,\" and its trenchant accompanying video, were released just before her Super Bowl 50 half-time performance. That April, another striking visual album, Lemonade, premiered on HBO, and its audio was subsequently available for streaming and download. Some of the album\\'s specific, forthright lyrics fueled speculation about the status of Beyoncé and Jay-Z\\'s relationship. Kendrick Lamar, Jack White, James Blake, and the Weeknd appeared as featured artists, while Just Blaze, Mike Dean, and Diplo were among the co-producers. The Formation World Tour began days later, just before the album became her sixth consecutive number one studio album. After wrapping that half-year trek, Coachella announced that Beyoncé would be headlining the festival\\'s 2017 installment. While that performance was eventually canceled due to the birth of her twins, she would make a triumphant return to the desert stage a year later. Backed by a pyramid constructed with bleachers and over two-hundred backing performers, Beyoncé became the first Black female to headline the festival, closing both weekends of Coachella 2018 with historic performances that highlighted Black culture and featured guest appearances by Jay-Z, Solange, and a reunited Destiny\\'s Child.Months later in June 2018, while Beyoncé and Jay-Z\\'s co-headlining On the Run II tour was underway, the couple released Everything Is Love, a collaborative full-length credited to the Carters. Led by \"Apeshit,\" a single featuring input from Pharrell Williams, Quavo, and Offset, the album narrowly missed the top spot on the Billboard 200. Wrapping at the end of the year, On the Run II was the third-highest grossing tour of 2018.True to form, Beyoncé issued a surprise live album, the Grammy-winning Homecoming, in April 2019. Paired with a film of the same title, the set documented her 2018 Coachella performance and added a cover of Maze\\'s \"Before I Let Go.\" Later that year, she not only starred as Nala in the photorealistic remake of The Lion King, but curated the film\\'s accompanying soundtrack, The Lion King: The Gift. Featuring a wealth of African artists collaborating with the likes of co-star Donald Glover, Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams, Kendrick Lamar, and Tierra Whack, the album also included her single \"Spirit,\" which went on to receive both Grammy and Oscar nominations. Beyoncé returned to the top of the Hot 100 in May 2020 as a featured artist on Megan Thee Stallion\\'s \"Savage Remix.\" Only two months later, she was behind the musical film Black Is King, also her third visual album. She took four awards from the subsequent Grammy ceremony: Best R&amp;B Performance (for the Juneteenth charity single \"Black Parade\"), Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance (both for \"Savage\"), and Best Music Video (\"Brown Skin Girl\"). Another soundtrack song, \"Be Alive,\" arrived in May 2021 as part of the tennis biopic King Richard. In June 2022, Beyoncé released \"Break My Soul,\" a house track made with \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" collaborators the-Dream and Tricky Stewart, as the first single off her seventh studio album. The song reached the Top 20 of the Hot 100 before the late-July arrival of its parent release, Renaissance. A vibrant and uptempo collection inspired in part by post-\\'70s Black and queer dance music, Renaissance debuted at number one and in early 2023 earned Beyoncé four more Grammy Awards, making her the most awarded artist in the organization\\'s history. ~ TiVo Staff, Rovi'\n",

      "'One of the top boy bands of its era, *NSYNC helped to define the sound of danceable, R&amp;B-influenced 2000s pop and launched the career of singers and former Mickey Mouse Club stars Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez. Working closely with producers like Max Martin and Denniz Pop, *NSYNC enjoyed almost immediate success, hitting the Top Five in the United States and Europe with their eponymous debut and spawning the hits \"I Want You Back\" and \"Tearin\\' Up My Heart.\" 2000\\'s No Strings Attached and their final album, 2001\\'s Celebrity, fared even better, both topping the Billboard 200. While the group did reunite for a performance at the 2013 MTV Music Video Awards, the individual members of *NSYNC have all gone on to pursue their own varied opportunities, with Timberlake emerging as the biggest star, enjoying a highly successful, Grammy-winning music and acting career. Although *NSYNC emerged in 1995 in Orlando, Florida, singers JC Chasez and Justin Timberlake had previously co-starred on The Mickey Mouse Club before relocating to Nashville, where they worked on solo projects with the same vocal coach and songwriters. Timberlake soon returned to Orlando, where he befriended Chris Kirkpatrick and Joey Fatone. Along with Chasez, the four agreed to form a boy band, and *NSYNC officially launched after the addition of bass singer Lance Bass. The group recorded its debut LP, the eponymously-titled *NSYNC, with help from a series of producers, including Denniz Pop (whose protégé, Max Martin, would later work with the band after Pop\\'s death in 1998). The album was initially released by BMG Ariola Munich, and *NSYNC became an overnight success throughout much of Europe, where the singles \"I Want You Back\" and \"Tearing Up My Heart\" were sizable hits. The album was then released in America during the spring of 1998. Accompanied by a tour of the nation\\'s roller rinks, it became immensely popular and eventually sold more than ten million copies, thus establishing the singers as teen pop titans. Home for Christmas followed later that same year and went double-platinum, while a similar version was released in Europe under the title The Winter Album.Although already celebrated as one of pop music\\'s biggest acts, *NSYNC rose to greater heights with the release of No Strings Attached in 2000. The album was originally slated to appear in 1999, but a series of legal battles with former manager Lou Pearlman delayed its arrival by several months. After successfully escaping from Pearlman\\'s contract and signing with Jive Entertainment, *NSYNC happily watched as sales of No Strings Attached topped one million during its first day of release. Nearly two and a half million copies were sold by the end of the week, and three singles soon cracked the Top Five in America: \"Bye Bye Bye\" (which many viewed as a sendoff to the band\\'s old management), \"It\\'s Gonna Be Me,\" and the ballad \"This I Promise You.\" Supported by a 76-date American tour that grossed over $75 million, No Strings Attached proved to be the most popular album of 2000, selling nearly ten million copies.*NSYNC returned to the road in early 2001, this time to promote the impending release of Celebrity. The album appeared that summer to continued fanfare, with first-week sales reaching nearly two million -- a feat that made Celebrity the second fastest-selling album of all time, bested only by No Strings Attached. The album featured a stronger debt to hip-hop and included several songs written by Timberlake and Chasez, an opportunity that may have whetted their desire to pursue respective solo careers. Following an elaborate stadium tour, the group went on hiatus in mid-2002. Timberlake released his solo debut that same year, successfully making the jump from boy band vocalist to critically acclaimed solo artist, while Chasez also made his own solo bid with 2004\\'s Schizophrenic. Meanwhile, Joey Fatone launched a movie career and later performed on Broadway, Chris Kirkpatrick starred in the reality TV series Mission: Man Band, and Lance Bass became a certified cosmonaut in the hopes of making it to outer space before moving into TV and radio hosting work, as well as LGBTQ+ advocacy. A compilation, Greatest Hits, appeared in 2005 and the group\\'s website shut down in 2006, however, prompting increased speculation about *NSYNC\\'s future. Responding to such rumors in 2007, Bass informed the Orlando Sentinel that the group had \"definitely broken up\" in light of Timberlake\\'s desire to continue his solo career. In 2013, the group did briefly reunite at the MTV Video Music Awards, performing a medley of their hits \"Girlfriend\" and \"Bye Bye Bye,\" just prior to Timberlake receiving the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. All four members of *NSYNC (except for Timberlake) also appeared together at Coachella in 2019 where they joined Ariana Grande on-stage for a series of songs, including \"Tearing Up My Heart.\" ~ Matt Collar &amp; Andrew Leahey'\n",

      "'One of the most prominent artists in contemporary R&amp;B, Chris Brown is a dynamic vocalist whose longevity is attributable in part to his natural incorporation of hip-hop and embrace of club sounds ranging from EDM to Afrobeats. Greeted with comparisons to Michael Jackson and Usher, Brown arrived in 2005 as a teen pop-R&amp;B singer with \"Run It!,\" the first debut single by a male artist to top the Billboard Hot 100 in over a decade. While there was nowhere to go but down, at least in terms of chart positions, Brown was only getting started. Within a few years, he became a well-established star with Chris Brown (2005) and Exclusive (2007), multi-platinum albums that produced five more Top Ten singles, including \"Kiss Kiss\" and \"Forever.\" As a featured artist or duettist, he added to the count with hits such as \"No Air,\" a ballad with Jordin Sparks. By the end of the decade, Brown underwent a stylistic makeover during which his forebears shifted to the likes of Jodeci, R. Kelly, and 2Pac. This, and a more drastic change in his public image, did little to slow his commercial momentum. His streak of Top Ten albums was sustained with releases such as Graffiti (2009), the Grammy-winning F.A.M.E. (2011), and Fortune (2012). Brown\\'s artistic scope has continued to widen with Heartbreak on a Full Moon (2017) and Indigo (2019), albums as long as epic films, and Breezy (2022), his tenth consecutive Top Ten solo LP, featuring the hit \"Call Me Every Day,\" a cross-continental collaboration with Wizkid. Brown\\'s 11th album has been previewed with some of his warmest singles -- the Ciara duet \"How We Roll\" among them.Chris Brown is originally from Tappahannock, Virginia. Like a lot of kids born in the mid- to late \\'80s, he got into his parents\\' favorite music but eventually fell under the spell of hip-hop. Around the time his voice changed, he discovered his singing ability and switched his focus away from MCing. A move to New York led to being discovered by Tina Davis, a Def Jam A&amp;R executive who became the singer\\'s manager shortly after losing her position in the Sony-BMG merger. The Jive label, due in part to its track record with younger artists who had established longevity (like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake), won the bidding war for Brown and lined up several production and songwriting heavy weights, including Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, Sean Garrett, and Scott Storch, for his self-titled first album. An immediate Top Ten hit when it was released in 2005, Chris Brown not only featured the number one \"Run It!\" but two other Top Ten singles in \"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\" and \"Say Goodbye.\" Brown was subsequently nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best New Artist. Exclusive, released in 2007 and a bit of a departure from the wholesome image presented throughout his debut, was even more successful, featuring the number one single \"Kiss Kiss\" and two other Top Five hits. Yet another Top Five hit came with \"No Air,\" a duet with Jordin Sparks that appeared on Sparks\\' own self-titled album. Brown also co-wrote \"Disturbia,\" a number one hit for Rihanna.In March 2009, Brown was charged with felonious assault of Rihanna, an altercation that had prevented his then-partner from taking the stage at the Grammy Awards. Brown was scheduled to perform as well, but he did not appear and maintained a low profile for several months. A fairly substantial backlash resulted in Brown\\'s songs being pulled from rotation on several radio stations. Ultimately, however, it had little bearing on the progress of his music career and side acting gigs. The week before the December release of his third album, Graffiti, the single \"I Can Transform Ya\" was well on its way to reaching the Top 20 of the Hot 100, and his acting roles -- which had already included spots in Stomp the Yard and a recurring role on The O.C. -- hadn\\'t shown any sign of drying up. Graffiti fell considerably short of gold-selling status, but it was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, and a Tank collaboration, \"Take My Time,\" was nominated for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.Weeks after the 2011 Grammy Awards ceremony, Brown released his fourth album, F.A.M.E., which already had four singles on the charts. That record topped the Billboard 200 and the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop charts, and it took the 2012 Grammy for Best R&amp;B Album. During the ceremony, he performed a medley of \"Beautiful People\" and \"Turn Up the Music,\" the latter of which previewed Fortune, his fifth album, released in May 2012 and an immediate chart-topper in the U.S. A sequence of several singles that began with \"Fine China\" preceded X, released in September 2014. Less inspired by European dance-pop and more R&amp;B-oriented than his previous release, the album included contributions from R. Kelly, Usher, and Lil Wayne, among many others. Four of its singles peaked within the R&amp;B Top Ten. X was only five months old when Brown and Tyga, who had previously worked together on one of those hits -- \"Loyal,\" as well as the earlier \"Deuces\" -- teamed up for Fan of a Fan: The Album. By the end of 2015, Brown released Royalty, his seventh proper album, which was propped up by the Top 20 pop hit \"Back to Sleep.\" Brown cranked out material in larger volumes and made more featured appearances through the end of the 2010s. Heartbreak on a Full Moon arrived in October 2017 with 45 songs on its deluxe edition. It entered the Billboard 200 at number three, making it the artist\\'s eighth consecutive Top Ten album. The following year, Brown appeared on a few high-profile collaborative singles, highlighted by Lil Dicky\\'s \"Freaky Friday,\" another Top Ten hit. In June 2019, Brown returned with his ninth solo album, the chart-topping double-length Indigo. A track from the LP, \"No Guidance,\" was nominated for a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Song. The commercial mixtape Slime &amp; B, a collaboration with Young Thug, followed in May 2020 and hit number 24 on the Billboard 200. Brown returned in June 2022 with the number four hit Breezy. Aiming to relate more directly to the women in his audience with an emphasis on slow jams and ballads, he also added the likes of Ella Mai and H.E.R. to a supporting cast that included WizKid, Jack Harlow, and Lil Durk. Despite the LP\\'s many guests, the unassisted \"Iffy\" and \"WE (Warm Embrace)\" were its two first singles to hit the Hot 100. Brown stayed busy in 2023, teaming up with Fridayy on the R&amp;B anthem \"Don\\'t Give It Away,\" appearing on Chlöe Bailey\\'s \"How Does It Feel,\" and giving fans a sneak peek at his forthcoming 11th long-player with \"Summer Too Hot\" and \"How We Roll,\" the latter a collaboration with Ciara. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi'\n",

      "'A singer/songwriter whose vibrant melodies transformed him from an outsider into a chart-topping artist, Mika\\'s kaleidoscopic music makes the most of the escapist, empowering potential of fantasies. On his 2007 U.K. number one hit single \"Grace Kelly,\" the vibrancy of Mika\\'s multi-octave, classically trained voice and clever, detailed lyrics reflected his traumatic early years, when music was his only source of hope. Mika\\'s early albums, such as 2007\\'s number one debut Life in Cartoon Motion and 2009\\'s The Boy Who Knew Too Much (which reached a career-high number 19 in the U.S.), were larger-than-life examples of how his music spoke to other outcasts as well as a much wider audience. As time passed, his approach grew more down-to-earth, particularly on 2019\\'s My Name Is Michael Holbrook and 2022\\'s single \"Yo Yo,\" but never entirely lost the magical reality at the heart of his music. Born Michael Holbrook Penniman, Jr. in Beirut to an American-Lebanese mother and American father, Mika and his parents moved to Paris while he was still very young. It was there that he learned to play piano, and he wrote his first song at the age of seven. When Mika was nine, the family relocated to London; the frequent moves, incidents like his father being taken hostage at Kuwait\\'s American Embassy, and bullying at school affected him to the point where he stopped talking. At age 12, he was homeschooled for six months. During this time, music became Mika\\'s lifeline, and he soon began formal musical training, which included voice lessons with a professional Russian opera singer. When he returned to school, he became the head of the choir at St. Philip\\'s School in Kensington and sang at the Royal Opera House. While studying at the Royal College of Music in his teens and early twenties, Mika recorded with the Royal Opera House and created a jingle for Orbit chewing gum. He dropped out of school to concentrate on his music, taking inspiration from freewheeling songwriters like Prince and Harry Nilsson. His debut single, \"Relax, Take It Easy,\" appeared in the latter half of 2006, along with the Dodgy Holiday EP. However, it was his next release, \"Grace Kelly,\" that broke Mika in the U.K. Issued in January 2007, the song hit number one on the U.K. singles chart. His full-length debut, Life in Cartoon Motion, did just as well when it arrived on Casablanca Records a month later; it topped the U.K. album chart around the time it received a U.S. release that March. Mika went on to win the Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act and the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year, and earned a 2008 Grammy nomination for Best Dance Record for \"Live Today,\" among other accolades. Ahead of his second album, Mika issued Songs for Sorrow, a limited-edition EP of songs that included illustrations by some of his favorite visual artists. For September 2009\\'s The Boy Who Knew Too Much, Mika collaborated in Los Angeles with producer Greg Wells, Imogen Heap, and Owen Pallett. The album\\'s vibrant exploration of adolescent angst built on Life in Cartoon Motion\\'s success, reaching number one in France, number four in the U.K., and cracking the Top 20 in the States. Its lead single, \"We Are Golden,\" was another Top Ten hit for Mika in the U.K. Following The Boy Who Knew Too Much\\'s release, he was awarded the French Order of Arts and Letters in March 2010, and contributed the song \"Kick Ass (We Are Young)\" to the Kick-Ass soundtrack. After spending much of 2010 and 2011 on the road, Mika opted for a more serious and straightforward direction for his third album. Inspired by the music of Daft Punk and Fleetwood Mac, as well as a near-fatal accident his beloved sister Paloma suffered, October 2012\\'s The Origin of Love featured contributions from Wells, William Orbit, Benny Benassi, Pharrell Williams, and Empire of the Sun\\'s Nick Littlemore. Around the time of the album\\'s release, Mika officially came out as gay. In 2013, he became a judge on the seventh season of the reality TV talent competition The X Factor Italy, and issued the Italian compilation Songbook, Vol. 1 late that year. In 2014, he also joined the French TV singing competition The Voice: La Plus Belle Voix, where he remained as a judge for several seasons. Following the 2014 French-language hit \"Boum Boum Boum,\" Mika returned with his fourth album, June 2015\\'s No Place in Heaven, another collaboration with Wells with a more mature sound informed by \\'60s pop music. The album became a Top Five hit in France, Italy, and Switzerland and reached number 19 in the U.K. That November, Mika released his first live album, L\\'Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal. Despite this success, his misgivings about the commercial side of music-making led him to take a break after the No Place in Heaven tour ended. In 2017 and 2018, he created and hosted the award-winning Italian variety show Stasera casa Mika while writing songs at his own pace. This relaxed creativity and openness seeped into 2019\\'s My Name Is Michael Holbrook, which continued the more grounded style of No Place in Heaven but also left room for Mika\\'s trademark flights of fancy. The album was a Top Ten hit in Italy and France, and reached number 57 on the U.K. Album charts. Mika supported My Name Is Michael Holbrook with a tour of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, and in between live dates, appeared on reality competition shows including X Factor Italia and France\\'s The Voice Kids. Early in 2020, the live album Live at Brooklyn Steel appeared. Though the COVID-19 global pandemic forced him to cancel many of his 2020 tour dates, Mika remained busy. He appeared as a judge on X Factor Italia and performed at I Love Beirut, a streaming concert to aid Beirut following the August 2020 explosion in the city. Mika\\'s participation in I Love Beirut led Lebanon to award him the Order of Merit. Late in 2020, he hosted the charity concert \"Do Re Mika Sol\" and collaborated with the Royal Opera of Versailles on a performance captured by the early 2021 album A l\\'opéra Royal De Versailles. For that year\\'s Pride Month, he performed a live-streaming concert that benefitted Lady Gaga\\'s Born This Way Foundation. Later in 2021, Mika returned to his judging duties on X Factor Italia and performed a pair of concerts at the Philharmonie de Paris that were broadcast on French and Italian TV. In May 2022, Mika co-hosted the Eurovision Song Contest with Laura Pausini and presenter Alessandro Cattelan; during the contest\\'s finale, he performed his darkly pulsing synth pop single \"Yo Yo.\" ~ Heather Phares &amp; Marcy Donelson'\n",

      "'A Juno-winning and Grammy-nominated pop singer/songwriter who broke records with his debut single, Canada\\'s Shawn Mendes became known to international audiences when he was just 15. His mix of Ed Sheeran\\'s and Justin Bieber\\'s styles was a hit from his first single, 2014\\'s \"Life of the Party,\" which made him the youngest artist to land a debut single in the Top 25 in the U.S. His full-length debut, 2015\\'s Handwritten, went to number one in the U.S. and Canada, a feat repeated by releases including 2018\\'s Shawn Mendes and 2020\\'s Wonder. Mendes also found success with stand-alone singles like 2021\\'s Tainy collaboration \"Summer of Love\" and his solo cut \"It\\'ll Be Okay.\" In 2022, he voiced the lead character and sang on the soundtrack to the musical film Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile. A year later, he offered the climate change-inspired single \"What the Hell Are We Dying For?\"Born and raised in Pickering, Ontario, in Greater Toronto, Shawn Peter Raul Mendes taught himself guitar at the age of 14. He also sang in his school\\'s glee club and took acting lessons as a teen. After posting a series of cover songs to various video-sharing sites beginning in 2013, he earned a dedicated following. His version of A Great Big World\\'s \"Say Something\" won Ryan Seacrest\\'s cover-song contest in April 2014, and Mendes signed to Island Records a month later. That June, they released the then-15-year-old\\'s debut single \"Life of the Party.\" American radio initially ignored it, but the track entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 24, making Mendes the youngest artist to land their first single in the Top 25. The song was also included on his four-track Island debut, The Shawn Mendes EP, which performed well, reaching number five on the Billboard charts and setting the stage for his full-length debut, 2015\\'s Handwritten. Handwritten debuted at number one in the U.S., Canada, and Norway, also reaching the Top Ten in several other European countries. Meanwhile, Mendes had his first U.S. Top Ten hit with third single \"Stitches,\" reaching number four while topping the singles chart in the U.K. In addition, his song \"Believe\" appeared on the soundtrack for the Disney Channel fantasy musical Descendants. While opening for Taylor Swift on the North American dates of her 1989 World Tour, Mendes and Fifth Harmony\\'s Camila Cabello collaborated on the song \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" which was included on a deluxe version of Handwritten that arrived in November 2015. The song reached the Top 20 of the American and Canadian singles charts. Recorded in upstate New York and issued in September 2016, Mendes\\' second long-player, Illuminate, offered the Top Ten tracks \"Treat You Better\" and \"There\\'s Nothin\\' Holdin\\' Me Back.\" Featuring co-songwriting contributions from Teddy Geiger and Scott Harris, the album debuted at number one in the U.S. and Canada, and \"There\\'s Nothing Holdin\\' Me Back\" went on to win a Juno Award for Single of the Year. Illuminate was followed in December by the digital-only Live at Madison Square Garden. Mendes launched a massive world tour in April 2017, which included a live acoustic session for MTV Unplugged that was released in November. In April 2018, Mendes performed his song \"In My Blood\" at a concert for Queen Elizabeth II\\'s 92nd birthday at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The track\\'s lyrics explored the songwriter\\'s struggles with anxiety disorder and was later released as the lead single for his third full-length, Shawn Mendes, which arrived in May of that year. Featuring collaborations with Geiger, it debuted at number one in the U.S., Canada, and Australia and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album alongside the lead single\\'s nomination for Song of the Year. In Canada, the eponymous LP collected Juno Awards for Pop Album and Album of the Year, and Mendes won Artist and Songwriter of the Year. \"In My Blood\" earned him yet another Juno, his second for Single of the Year. A deluxe version of Shawn Mendes followed later in 2019 containing the hit singles \"If I Can\\'t Have You\" and \"Señorita.\" Again featuring Camila Cabello, \"Señorita\" became a global chart-topper that picked up a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. \"Wonder,\" the title track and first single from Mendes\\' fourth album, went to number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 after its October 2020 release, while its sequel \"Monster\" -- a duet with Justin Bieber -- peaked at eight. Wonder appeared on December 4, 2020, reaching number one in both the U.S. and Canada. A non-album collaboration with Tainy, \"Summer of Love,\" arrived in August 2021, followed a few months later by the solo track \"It\\'ll Be Okay.\" The singles continued the following year with \"When You\\'re Gone.\" Mendes voiced the titular anthropomorphic saltwater crocodile in the family musical film Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile (2022), for which he also contributed the songs \"Carried Away\" and \"Heartbeat,\" among others. In June 2023, Mendes issued the track \"What the Hell Are We Dying For?\" Written and recorded only days before its release, the song was centered around the effects of climate change, and its cover depicted the New York skyline through the orange haze smoke from devastating Canadian wildfires. ~ Marcy Donelson &amp; David Jeffries, Rovi'\n",

      "'Canadian rapper and vocalist Drake sustained a high-level commercial presence shortly after he hit the scene in 2006, whether with his own chart-topping releases or a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&amp;B crooning, and his golden touch with songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011\\'s Take Care to 2018\\'s trap-influenced Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning \"Hotline Bling\" and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring the Weeknd\\'s early work, starting the OVO Sound label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake\\'s constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world\\'s most popular musicians, and the release of albums like 2022\\'s Honestly, Nevermind became cultural events. Known initially for his role as Jimmy Brooks on Degrassi: The Next Generation, the Toronto-born Aubrey Drake Graham stepped out as a rapper and singer with pop appeal in 2006, when he initiated a series of mixtapes. A year later, despite being unsigned, he scored major exposure when his cocky and laid-back track \"Replacement Girl,\" featuring Trey Songz, was featured on BET\\'s 106 &amp; Park program as its \"Joint of the Day.\" He raised his profile throughout the next several months by popping up on countless mixtapes and remixes, and as rumors swirled about contract offers from labels, he gradually became one of the most talked-about artists in the industry. It did not hurt that he had support from the likes of Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Lil Wayne. By the end of June 2009, \"Best I Ever Had,\" a promotional single, had climbed to number two on Billboard\\'s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. After a fierce bidding war, Drake signed with Universal Motown in late summer and released an EP, So Far Gone, made up of songs from his popular mixtape of the same title. It peaked at number six on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and won a 2010 Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year. Thank Me Later, a full-length featuring collaborations with the Kings of Leon, the-Dream, Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Lil Wayne, was issued through Young Money in June 2010. It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Still, the artist felt his debut was rushed, so its follow-up arrived in November 2011 with the title Take Care, referencing the increased time and effort put into the album\\'s creation. Receiving critical acclaim, Grammy Awards, and the number one slot on the U.S. Billboard 200, Take Care cemented Drake\\'s place as one of Canada\\'s biggest exports. While on tour in 2012, Drake announced that he had started work on what would be his third studio album; Nothing Was the Same was released the following September. It spawned many singles, topped charts around the world, was shortlisted for the Polaris Music Prize, and was nominated for a Best Rap Album Grammy Award. Soon after the album\\'s release, Drake hit the road on an extended tour, took part in some collaborations, and released a few singles, including the Grammy-nominated \"0 to 100/The Catch Up.\" His next release was planned as a free mixtape before Cash Money decided they would rather charge for it. The decidedly downbeat If You\\'re Reading This It\\'s Too Late was released in February 2015 and debuted at number one, while all 17 of its songs entered the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. In late summer 2015, Drake released a trio of new tracks on his SoundCloud page. One of them, the Timmy Thomas-sampling \"Hotline Bling,\" became a Top Five pop hit in Canada and the U.S. and something of a cultural phenomenon. Later that year, Drake hit the studio with Future for a six-day session that yielded the mixtape What a Time to Be Alive. Upon the album\\'s September release, it became Drake\\'s second recording of the year to debut at number one. After issuing three singles in the beginning months of 2016, his fourth album, Views, arrived in April and debuted at number one. It revolved lyrically around his hometown of Toronto and featured production by longtime cohorts Noah \"40\" Shebib and Boi-1da, among others. Late that year, Drake issued another trio of singles, including the chart-topping \"Fake Love.\" They preceded the playlist More Life, released the following March with appearances from Kanye West, Quavo, Travis Scott, and Young Thug. The release became his seventh consecutive chart-topping album.At the start of 2018, Drake issued the two-song EP Scary Hours. Both \"Diplomatic Immunity\" and \"God\\'s Plan\" hit the Top Ten, the latter becoming his second solo chart-topper. It served as a precursor to his fifth album, the two-disc set Scorpion, which was broken into a rap side and an R&amp;B side that featured the hit single \"Nice for What.\" It was released in June and instantly went platinum, while also breaking records for most streams in a single day. At the 61st Grammy Awards, Drake took home the prize for Best Rap Song for \"God\\'s Plan.\" In 2019, Drake raided the vaults for two archival releases: an official streaming release of the So Far Gone mixtape, and the Billboard 200-topping Care Package, which rounded up tracks that were leaked, discarded, or used as teasers, dating back to the Take Care era. Drake collected two Grammy nominations for the 2020 ceremonies, one for Best Rap Song with his Rick Ross collaboration \"Gold Roses\" and another for Best R&amp;B Song with his Chris Brown-assisted \"No Guidance.\" That same year, he released another mixtape made up of demos and singles titled Dark Lane Demo Tapes. One of the tracks was \"Toosie Slide,\" his third song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making him the first male artist to accomplish that feat. Drake followed up with a slew of guest spots on songs by DJ Khaled, Bryson Tiller, Lil Wayne, and Drakeo the Ruler, then issued the \"Laugh Now Cry Later\" single in late 2020. The Lil Durk-featured track was touted as the first single from Certified Lover Boy, Drake\\'s soon-to-be-released sixth official album. It didn\\'t materialize as quickly as planned due to his knee surgery and recovery that precluded any work. Instead, an EP titled Scary Hours 2 was issued in early 2021, and Drake appeared on songs by Migos, Smiley, Nicki Minaj, and Trippie Redd. Sporting a controversial Damien Hirst-designed cover, the trap-inspired CLB was finally released that September and featured appearances by a who\\'s who of the rap scene past and present including Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Young Thug, Future, Lil Baby, and many more. Like the five previous records, it topped the album charts in Canada and the U.S. Drake stayed busy throughout 2022, appearing as a guest on albums by Gunna and Future, collaborating with DJ Khaled, and signing a deal with Universal for one of the largest contracts in music business history. It took until June of that year for Drake to release any music under his own name, and when he did it was the house music-inspired Honestly, Nevermind. Though the album featured a large number of producers, most prominently Noah \"40\" Shebib, Black Coffee, and Carnage, the only other rapper to appear was 21 Savage. The collaboration with the latter was built out into a full-length album titled Her Loss. Released in late 2022, the record relied on trap beats, melancholy synth washes, and a surprising number of disses. ~ Tim Sendra, Rovi'\n",

      "'An all-around entertainer with a powerhouse voice and plenty of charm, Kelly Clarkson\\'s warm, multi-octave voice is equally at home in pop, rock, and country. As the winner of American Idol\\'s debut season, Clarkson\\'s fame was instant -- her debut \"Before Your Love/A Moment Like This\" was 2002\\'s best-selling single in the U.S. -- but she defined her career on her own terms almost as quickly. She pivoted from the mainstream pop of 2003\\'s Thankful with the following year\\'s Breakaway, which spanned the anthemic, rock-tinged smash \"Since U Been Gone\" to the power balladry of \"Because of You.\" From there, she showed just how wide her vocal and stylistic range was as she ventured into harder rock on 2007\\'s My December, country on 2011\\'s Stronger, R&amp;B on 2017\\'s Meaning of Life, and combined them all with maturity on 2023\\'s chemistry. As the years passed, Clarkson\\'s creative projects also expanded: She authored children\\'s books and returned to her TV roots as a coach on The Voice and as the host of her Emmy-winning talk show. Along the way, she racked up a remarkable number of hit singles and albums as well as nominations and awards, establishing her as one of the most accomplished and popular artists to emerge from singing competition shows in the U.S.Born in Fort Worth and raised in Burleson, Texas, Clarkson first fell in love with music when she experienced the power of a gospel choir while visiting a local Black church. Her own vocal talents were discovered in seventh grade, when the school\\'s choir teacher heard her sing and urged her to join the choir. While growing up, she absorbed the music her family listened to, which ranged from Willie Nelson and Whitney Houston to Celine Dion and Metallica. During high school, she appeared in several musicals, performed in talent shows, and began classical vocal training. Though several schools offered her scholarships, Clarkson opted to skip college to pursue a career in music. She saved her money and recorded a demo that she sent to labels; despite getting offers from Jive and Interscope, she turned them down, fearing that she\\'d only be seen as a teen pop artist. In 2001, Clarkson went to Los Angeles to make her name. She appeared as an extra on Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Dharma &amp; Greg and recorded a demo with Gerry Goffin, but few opportunities materialized. Upon returning to Burleson, Clarkson worked at a movie theater, promoted Red Bull energy drinks, and ultimately worked as a cocktail waitress at a comedy club before entering the American Idol contest. One of 10,000 aspiring singers, Clarkson distinguished herself not only with her big, surprisingly mature voice, but also with her down-to-earth charm and sense of humor; at one of her auditions, she switched places with judge Randy Jackson, who did an impromptu version of R. Kelly\\'s \"I Believe I Can Fly.\" Over the course of the 13-week show, her consistently strong performances of songs like \"Respect,\" \"Natural Woman,\" \"Stuff Like That There,\" and \"Without You\" earned Clarkson enough audience votes to claim one of the contest\\'s two finalist positions. After singing \"A Moment Like This\" and \"Before Your Love,\" both of which were written for the show, Clarkson won the American Idol contest with 58-percent of the audience\\'s votes. In addition to the show\\'s prize of one million dollars and a recording contract with RCA, Clarkson secured a deal with Creative Artists Agency and several bookings, including the national American Idol tour and a performance of the national anthem at the September 11 commemoration at Washington, D.C.\\'s Lincoln Memorial. Clarkson\\'s first single, the double A-side release \"Before Your Love/A Moment Like This,\" was released just two weeks after she won the contest and quickly earned platinum sales. Debuting at number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it rose to 52 the following week and then to the top of the chart, breaking the Beatles\\' 38-year-old record for the biggest rise to number one and ultimately becoming the best-selling single of 2002 in the U.S. Her debut full-length, Thankful, was released in April 2003, just in time to coincide with the second season of American Idol (and right before the release of the American Idol movie, From Justin to Kelly). Blending pop, R&amp;B, and gospel, the album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 Albums chart and was certified double platinum by the RIAA; it made Clarkson a global phenomenon, selling more than 4.5 million copies internationally, going platinum in Canada, and gold in Australia and Japan. Thankful\\'s lead single, \"Miss Independent,\" achieved similar success, becoming a Top Ten hit in the U.S. and four other countries and earning Clarkson her first Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Seeking to establish herself as an artist beyond her American Idol fame, Clarkson hired new management and gave her music a rock edge. Featuring songs co-written by former Evanescence members Ben Moody and David Hodges as well as pop masterminds Dr. Luke and Max Martin, Breakaway arrived in November 2004 and built on Thankful\\'s success. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 Albums chart, went sextuple platinum in the U.S., and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. The album\\'s singles were also huge hits in the States and around the world: Mixing the sounds of rock revivalists like the Strokes with mainstream pop hooks, \"Since U Been Gone\" reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. The title track -- which originally appeared on the soundtrack to The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement -- became Clarkson\\'s third Top Ten single in 2006 and topped the Billboard Adult Contemporary Audience chart for 28 weeks, making it her longest-running number one on any chart. \"Because of You\" was a Top Ten hit in the U.S. but became one of her biggest global smashes, topping the European Hot 100 Singles chart as well as charts in countries ranging from Brazil to the Netherlands and Denmark. Breakaway earned Clarkson the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, while \"Since U Been Gone\" snagged the award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. When the Breakaway tour ended in 2006, Clarkson began work on her third album. Appearing in June 2007, My December marked her first foray into songwriting. It featured a darker, more rock-oriented edge than its predecessor and even included a guest appearance by punk icon and bassist Mike Watt. However, label exec Clive Davis openly disapproved of the album\\'s direction, claiming that it lacked the commercial appeal of Breakaway. A public feud ensued, and Clarkson was dealt another blow when poor ticket sales resulted in the cancellation of her upcoming tour. Despite this, the lead-off single \"Never Again\" became a Top Ten pop hit. My December debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 albums chart and made its way to platinum status by year\\'s end. Clarkson also collaborated with Reba McEntire several times in 2007, first appearing on the country star\\'s TV series Reba and then performing with her on the TV special CMT Giants: Reba McEntire. Later in the year, the pair performed a version of \"Because of You\" at the Academy of Country Music Awards that was included on McEntire\\'s album Reba: Duets, which became a Top Five hit on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Clarkson returned to the top of the charts in early 2009, when the single \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" set a record for the largest leap to number one. A return to the pop sounds of Breakaway, it also hit number one in the U.K., Canada, and Hungary. Composed by songwriting vets Martin, Lukasz Gottwald, and Claude Kelly, the song also set the stage for her fourth album, March 2009\\'s All I Ever Wanted, which was mostly produced by OneRepublic\\'s Ryan Tedder and featured Dr. Luke, Martin, Glen Ballard, and Katy Perry as members of its creative team. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart and held onto that position for two weeks; later in the year, it was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Vocal Pop Album. The album\\'s other two singles, \"I Do Not Hook Up\" and \"Already Gone,\" were Top 20 hits in the States. Clarkson delved deeper into country music with 2010\\'s \"Don\\'t You Wanna Stay,\" a Grammy-nominated duet with Jason Aldean that appeared on his album My Kinda Party. The single topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, making it Clarkson\\'s first number one on that chart. Country influences also made themselves known on her next album, October 2011\\'s Stronger. Featuring production work by Greg Kurstin, Darkchild, and Toby Gad, among others, the album reached number two on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. When it snagged the Best Pop Vocal Album Grammy Award, it made Clarkson the first artist to win the award twice. Stronger spawned several hit singles: The title track was her third number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for three Grammy Awards, while \"Mr. Know It All\" was her ninth Top Ten hit in the U.S. and \"Dark Side\" marked her 11th Top Ten hit on Billboard\\'s Adult Pop Songs chart. In the wake of Stronger\\'s success, Clarkson expanded into other projects. She co-wrote the song \"Tell Me a Lie,\" which appeared on One Direction\\'s 2011 debut album Up All Night, and returned to her roots by appearing as a mentor and judge on the singing competition TV show Duets in 2012. That year, she also served as a guest mentor on season two of The Voice and celebrated her tenth year as a recording artist with Greatest Hits, Chapter 1. The collection included three newly recorded songs -- \"Catch My Breath\" became her 14th Top 20 hit and her 13th million-selling single in the U.S. \"Don\\'t Rush,\" a collaboration with Vince Gill, was nominated for the Best Country Duo/Group Performance Grammy Award. Clarkson kicked off 2013 by performing at the second inauguration of President Barack Obama, then collaborated with Jewel and Robbie Williams later in the year. That October saw the release of her first holiday album, Wrapped in Red. As well as the usual selection of festive favorites, it included a number of newly written songs, including several co-penned by Clarkson herself. By the end of the year, the album was certified platinum by the RIAA. Alongside collaborations with Martina McBride, Trisha Yearwood, and Josh Groban, Clarkson spent much of 2014 recording her next album with producer Greg Kurstin. The first single, \"Heartbeat Song,\" appeared in January 2015 and, a few months later, the electro-pop-influenced Piece by Piece debuted atop the Billboard 200. This marked her third number one album and first since 2009. It included songs penned by Sia and Kara DioGuardi, as well as a feature for John Legend on \"Run Run Run.\" Piece by Piece earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album, while \"Heartbeat Song\" was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance. Nearly a year later, after a heartfelt performance during the 14th season of American Idol, title track \"Piece by Piece\" shot into the Billboard Top Ten. The single went on to garner a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance. In 2016, Clarkson joined Missy Elliot, Janelle Monáe, Kelly Rowland, Lea Michele, and Zendaya on the song \"This Is for My Girls,\" which was part of First Lady Michelle Obama\\'s third-world education campaign called \"Let Girls Learn.\" That June, she unveiled kellyclarksonlive.com, which distributed live recordings of fan-requested cover songs performed during her Piece by Piece tour, including Radiohead\\'s \"Creep\" and Coldplay\\'s \"Fix You.\" In October, she published her first children\\'s book, River Rose and the Magical Lullaby, which featured a lullaby she wrote. By year\\'s end, she\\'d contributed to the Hamilton Mixtape (\"It\\'s Quiet Uptown\") and the soundtrack to The Shack, the latter of which, a duet with Aloe Blacc called \"Love Goes On,\" was released as a single in February 2017. In September of that year, Clarkson released \"Love So Soft,\" the lead single from her eighth studio album and first for Atlantic. Appearing that October, Meaning of Life dug deeper into her love for R&amp;B and soul music. Her eighth album in a row to debut in the Top Three of the Billboard 200 Albums chart, the album earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album, while \"Love So Soft\" earned a nomination for Best Pop Solo Performance.

That March, she issued the single \"I\\'ve Loved You Since Forever,\" an adaptation of Hoda Kotb\\'s children\\'s book by the same name. In May, she returned to season 15 of The Voice as a coach, and once again guided one of her team members, Chevel Shepherd, to victory, making her the show\\'s first female coach to win multiple seasons. That November, she issued a cover version of \"Never Enough\" from the popular musical Greatest Showman. Clarkson continued her tenure on The Voice in 2019, returning for its 16th season in February. That May, she lent her voice and original songs, including the single \"Broken &amp; Beautiful,\" to the animated film UglyDolls.

      "'\"Always building up, falling apart. Love is an art,\" sings Vanessa Carlton on the title track of her sixth album, Love Is An Art. Like the record itself, the song is a meditation on the eternal seesaw that is human connection: the push, the pull, the balance, the bottoming out. It\\'s that constantly evolving nature of love, expectations and compassion that Carlton analyzes from all angles on Love Is An Art, from romantic, to parental, to the friends that hold us up and the leaders that repeatedly let us down. And on tracks like the album\\'s opener, \"I Can\\'t Stay the Same,\" that also includes the relationship with the person staring back at us in the mirror, each and every morning.Produced by Dave Fridmann (MGMT, Flaming Lips), Love Is An Art finds Carlton reckoning with toxic relationships (the confessional \"Miner\\'s Canary\"), eternal partnership (\"Companion Star\") and the children who fill the world with love and grace while politicians fill their pockets (the passionate \"Die, Dinosaur,\" written after the shootings in Parkland, Florida). And true to Carlton\\'s skill as both a lyricist and an instrumentalist, the arrangements on Love Is An Art tell these tales as vibrantly as the words themselves: piano parts that speak of rage and tenderness, synths that burst and glow like dawn.'\n",

A full ten years and billions of streams later, Hozier still calls Wicklow home.

Multi-platinum album sales, number one records on both sides of the Atlantic, multiple awards including a Grammy-nomination, film and video game soundtracks and countless sold-out live shows all over the world.

      "'Swedish hitmaking singer/songwriter Zara Larsson crafts R&amp;B- and club-influenced dance-pop influenced by artists like Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Robyn. After winning a Swedish singing competition at the age of eight, Larsson crashed the mainstream in the mid-2010s with a string of Swedish number ones like \"Lush Life\" and \"Never Forget You,\" which were certified multi-platinum around the world. Those tracks landed on her 2017 chart-topping, multi-platinum breakthrough So Good, a Top Ten hit across Europe and Australasia. Her third album, Poster Girl, arrived in 2021 and again brought her to the Top Ten in Sweden with the hit \"Ruin My Life.\"Born in the Stockholm suburb of Solna, Larsson first caught the public\\'s eyes and ears in 2008 as the winner of the popular Swedish talent show Talang Sverige (the regional version of Got Talent). Following the success of the show, she inked a deal with Ten Music Group and issued her debut EP, Introducing, which featured the hit single \"Uncover\" in 2013. The song was certified triple platinum in her home country, and after another EP, Allow Me to Reintroduce Myself, Larsson began work on her official debut long-player. The resulting 1 arrived in 2014 via Record Company Ten and Universal Music. Three additional singles reached the Swedish Top Ten: \"She\\'s Not Me,\" \"Carry You Home,\" and \"Rooftop.\" A pair of 2015 singles proved to be Larsson\\'s international breakthrough. First, the multi-platinum smash hit \"Lush Life\" reached the Top Ten across Europe, then \"Never Forget You\" (featuring MNEK) hit the Top Ten in Great Britain and went platinum in the United States. Those tracks would eventually appear on her sophomore LP. Before the release of that album, she collaborated with Tinie Tempah on \"Girls Like\" and David Guetta for the 2016 UEFA Euro Cup theme \"This One\\'s for You.\" By the time So Good was released in early 2017, four additional singles had been issued, including the Charlie Puth-penned \"So Good\" with Ty Dolla $ign, \"Symphony\" with Clean Bandit, and the MNEK-produced \"Ain\\'t My Fault.\" The set debuted atop the charts in Sweden and marked her chart debut across the world, including in the U.S., where it reached the Top 30. The following year, Larsson released the platinum-certified single \"Ruin My Life\" -- the first offering from what would become her third album -- and entered 2019 with \"Don\\'t Worry Bout Me,\" \"All the Time,\" and \"Wow.\" She also collaborated with K-pop superstars BTS on \"A Brand New Day,\" provided \"Invisible,\" the theme song for the animated film Klaus, and teamed with Tyga and Kygo for the latter\\'s tropical club anthem \"Like It Is,\" which became a Top Five hit in Sweden, New Zealand, and Norway. Later that year, she released \"Love Me Land,\" the official lead single from her third album, 2021\\'s Poster Girl. Collecting singles from as early as 2018 (\"Ruin My Life\"), the R&amp;B-influenced pop set also included \"Talk About Love\" with Young Thug.

      "'Eminem is one of the best-selling artists in music history, and easily one of rap\\'s biggest crossover successes. He was the first white rapper since the Beastie Boys to garner both sales and critical respect, but his impact has exceeded this confining distinction. On sheer technical skills, Eminem is one of the greatest MCs of his generation: rapid, fluid, dexterous, and unpredictable, capable of pulling off long-form narratives or withering asides. And thanks to his mentor Dr. Dre, he\\'s had music to match: thick, muscular loops evoking the terror and paranoia conjured by his lyrics. To be certain, a great deal of the controversy Eminem courted -- during the turn of the millennium, there was no greater pop culture bogeyman than Marshall Mathers -- came through in how his violent fantasias, often directed at his mother or his wife, intertwined with flights of absurdity that appealed to listeners too young to absorb the psychodramas Eminem explored on his hit albums The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. With hits \"My Name Is\" and \"The Real Slim Shady,\" he ruled the airwaves, but it wasn\\'t long before some detractors acknowledged his depth, helped in part by singles like the mournful \"Stan,\" written from the perspective of an obsessed fan. Eminem\\'s commercial peak came around the time of his 2002 album The Eminem Show (which went platinum 27 times over) and with his crossover onto the big screen that same year with 8 Mile, a film that earned him acclaim for his performance and an Oscar for the film\\'s anthem, \"Lose Yourself.\" A number of demons have led him to withdraw periodically, but he\\'s always returned with mid-career rejuvenations like 2009\\'s Relapse or 2020\\'s Music to Be Murdered By.Born Marshall Mathers in the Kansas City, Missouri suburb of St. Joseph, Eminem spent his childhood between Missouri and Michigan, settling in Detroit in his teens. At the age of 14, he began rapping with a high school friend, the two adopting the names \"Manix\" and \"M&amp;M,\" which soon morphed into Eminem. Under this name, Mathers entered battle rapping, a struggle dramatized in the fictionalized 8 Mile. Initially, the predominantly Black audience didn\\'t embrace him, but soon his skills gained him a reputation, and he was recruited to join several rap groups. The first of these was the New Jacks, and after they disbanded, he joined Soul Intent, who released a single in 1995. This track also featured Proof, and the two rappers broke off on their own to form D-12, a six-member crew that functioned more as a Wu-Tang-styled collective than a regularly performing group. As he was struggling to establish his career, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim had a daughter, Hailey, forcing him to spend less time rapping and more time providing for his family. He assembled his first album, Infinite, which received some underground attention in 1996, not all of it positive. After its release, Eminem developed his Slim Shady alter ego, a persona that freed him to dig deep into his dark id, something he needed as he faced a number of personal upheavals, beginning with a bad split with Kim, which led him to move in with his mother and increase his use of drugs and alcohol, capped off by an unsuccessful suicide attempt. All this sturm und drang was channeled into The Slim Shady EP, which is where he first demonstrated many of the quirks that became his trademark, including his twitchy, nasal rhyming and disturbingly violent imagery. The Slim Shady EP opened many doors, the most notable being a contract with Interscope Records. After Eminem came in second at the 1997 Rap Olympics MC Battle in Los Angeles, Interscope head Jimmy Iovine sought him out, giving the EP to Dr. Dre, who proved eager to work with Eminem. They quickly cut Em\\'s Interscope debut in the fall of 1998 -- during which time Marshall reconciled with Kim and married her -- and The Slim Shady LP appeared early in 1999, preceded by the single \"My Name Is.\" Both were instant blockbusters and Eminem became a lightning rod for attention, earning praise and disdain for his violent, satirical fantasias. Eminem quickly followed The Slim Shady LP with The Marshall Mathers LP in the summer of 2000. By this point, there was little doubt that Eminem was one of the biggest stars in pop music: the album sold almost two million copies within the first two weeks of release, but Mathers felt compelled to tweak other celebrities, provoking pop stars in his lyrics, and Insane Clown Posse\\'s entourage in person, providing endless fodder for the tabloids. This gossip blended with growing criticism about his violent and homophobic lyrics, and under this fire, he reunited his old crew, D-12, releasing an album in 2001, then touring with the group.During this furor, he had his biggest hit in the form of the moody ballad \"Stan.\" Performed at the Grammys as a duet with Elton John, thereby undercutting some accusations of homophobia, the song helped Eminem to cross over to a middlebrow audience, setting the stage for the ultimate crossover of 2001\\'s 8 Mile. Directed by Curtis Hanson, best known as the Oscar-nominated director of L.A. Confidential, the gritty drama fictionalized Eminem\\'s pre-fame Detroit days and earned considerable praise, culminating in one of his biggest hits with the theme \"Lose Yourself,\" which won Mathers an Oscar. After all this, he retreated from the spotlight to record his third album, The Eminem Show. Preceded by the single \"Without Me,\" it turned into another huge hit, albeit not quite as strong as its predecessor, and there were some criticisms suggesting that Eminem wasn\\'t expanding his horizons much. Encore, released late in 2004, did reach into more mature territory, notably on the anti-George W. Bush \"Mosh,\" but most of the controversy generated by the album was for behind-the-scenes events: a bus crash followed by canceled dates and a stint in rehab. Rumors of retirement flew, and the 2005 appearance of Curtain Call: The Hits did nothing to dampen them, nor did the turmoil of 2006, a year that saw Mathers remarrying and divorcing Kim within a matter of four months, as well as the shooting death of Proof at a Detroit club.During all this, Em did some minor studio work, but he soon dropped off the radar completely, retreating to his Detroit home. He popped up here and there, most notably debuting the hip-hop channel Shade 45 for Sirius Satellite Radio in September 2008, but it wasn\\'t until early 2009 that he mounted a comeback with Relapse, an album whose very title alluded to some of Mathers\\' struggles with prescription drugs, but it also announced that after an extended absence, Slim Shady was back. While not quite a blockbuster, the album went platinum, and Eminem followed it at the end of the year with an expanded version of Relapse (dubbed Relapse: Refill) that added outtakes and new recordings. Recovery, initially titled Relapse 2, was issued in June 2010. The album debuted on top of the Billboard 200 chart, where it remained for five consecutive weeks, while its leadoff single, \"Not Afraid,\" debuted on top of the magazine\\'s Hot 100 singles chart.The year 2010 also brought Eminem back together with Royce da 5\\'9\" under the Bad Meets Evil moniker. In turn, June 2011\\'s Hell: The Sequel marked the release of their first EP as a duo (barring the previous month\\'s release of key EP track \"Fastlane\" as a single) and was their first batch of new material since a 1999 double A-side. After an intense period of recording, Eminem announced in August 2013 that his next solo album would be a nostalgically themed set of new material entitled The Marshall Mathers LP 2, which landed in early November. The album featured the singles \"Berzerk,\" \"Rap God,\" and \"Survival,\" plus the chart-topping hit \"The Monster\" with Rihanna. In 2014, new tracks landed on the double-disc set Shady XV, which celebrated the Shady label\\'s 15th birthday. The singles \"Phenomenal\" and \"Kings Never Die\" featuring Gwen Stefani arrived a year later, both taken from the Southpaw soundtrack. Eminem resurfaced in October 2017 with a freestyle anti-Trump rap. The track didn\\'t appear on Revival, the December 2017 album that was filled with cameos, including appearances by Beyoncé (\"Walk on Water\"), Ed Sheeran (\"River\"), and P!nk (\"Need Me\"). His seventh straight chart-topper, it ultimately failed to match the sales heights of past efforts, despite the international success of the \"River\" single. The next year, without warning, Eminem issued his surprise tenth album, Kamikaze. The set featured appearances by Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5\\'9\", and Jessie Reyez, as well as \"Venom,\" from the film of the same name. In January 2020, he repeated this surprise-release approach with 11th studio album Music to Be Murdered By. The album featured production from Dr. Dre and cameos from the now-usual host of special guests, this time featuring Q-Tip, Ed Sheeran, Anderson .Paak, and the late Juice Wrld, among many others. The set debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and was re-released in expanded form in December under the title Music to Be Murdered By: Side B. In 2021, Eminem appeared on the Skylar Grey song \"Last One Standing\" along with Polo G and Mozzy. The track was featured on the soundtrack for the film Venom: Let There Be Carnage and cracked the Top 100 of the Billboard charts. 2021 also saw Eminem opening a spaghetti restaurant in Detroit, named Mom\\'s Spaghetti after a line from \"Lose Yourself.\" In February 2022, he performed alongside Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, Kendrick Lamar, and others at the halftime show of Super Bowl LVI. That June, Eminem released \"The King and I,\" a track he recorded with CeeLo Green for the soundtrack of Baz Luhrmann\\'s Elvis Presley biopic, Elvis. \"The King and I\" was one of three new songs on Curtain Call 2, a July 2022 compilation covering the singles Eminem had released since Curtain Call: The Hits. \"From the D to the LBC,\" a collaboration with Snoop Dogg, was also featured on Curtain Call 2. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'OutKast\\'s blend of gritty Southern soul, fluid raps, and the low-slung funk of their Organized Noize production crew epitomized the Atlanta wing of hip-hop\\'s rising force, the Dirty South, during the mid to late \\'90s. Along with Goodie Mob, OutKast took Southern hip-hop in bold and innovative directions: less reliance on aggression, more positivity and melody, thicker arrangements, and intricate lyrics. After Dré and Big Boi hit number one on the rap charts with their first single, \"Player\\'s Ball,\" the duo embarked on a run of platinum albums spiked with several hit singles, enjoying numerous critical accolades in addition to their commercial success.André Benjamin (Dré) and Antwan Patton (Big Boi) attended the same high school in the Atlanta borough of East Point, and several lyrical battles made each gain respect for the other\\'s skills. They formed OutKast and were pursued by Organized Noize Productions, hitmakers for TLC and Xscape. Signed to Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid and Babyface\\'s local LaFace label just after high school, OutKast recorded and released \"Player\\'s Ball,\" then watched the single rise to number one on the rap chart. It slipped from the top spot only after six weeks, was certified gold, and created a buzz for a full-length release. That album, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, hit the Top 20 in 1994 and was certified platinum by the end of the year. Dré and Big Boi also won Best New Rap Group of the Year at the 1995 Source Awards. OutKast returned with a new album in 1996, releasing ATLiens that August; it hit number two and went platinum with help from the gold-selling single \"Elevators (Me &amp; You)\" (number 12 pop, number one rap), as well as the Top 40 title track. Aquemini followed in 1998, also hitting number two and going double platinum. There were no huge hit singles this time around, but critics lavishly praised the album\\'s unified, progressive vision, hailing it as a great leap forward and including it on many year-end polls. Unfortunately, in a somewhat bizarre turn of events, OutKast was sued over the album\\'s lead single, \"Rosa Parks,\" by none other than the civil rights pioneer herself, who claimed that the group had unlawfully appropriated her name to promote their music, also objecting to some of the song\\'s language. The initial court decision dismissed the suit in late 1999. (The Supreme Court later allowed the lawsuit to proceed; the two parties eventually reached a settlement.) Dré modified his name to André 3000 before the group issued its hotly anticipated fourth album, Stankonia, in late 2000. Riding the momentum of uniformly excellent reviews and the stellar singles \"B.O.B.\" and \"Ms. Jackson,\" Stankonia debuted at number two and went triple platinum in just a few months; meanwhile, \"Ms. Jackson\" became their first number one pop single the following February. Both of those major singles and most of the album material -- all but three contributions from Organized Noize, in fact -- were produced by a trio dubbed Earthtone III (aka André 3000, Big Boi, and David \"Mr. DJ\" Sheats).2003\\'s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, a double album, debuted at number one and spawned a pair of number one singles: the Dré-fronted \"Hey Ya\" and the Big Boi-fronted \"The Way You Move.\" Speakerboxxx, more true to OutKast\\'s past, could have been issued as a Big Boi solo album, while The Love Below, a diverse and playful affair, could have been an André 3000 release. Regardless of its dual nature, the set won the 2004 Grammy for Album of the Year. As breakup rumors continued to swirl, the duo returned with the feature film Idlewild -- a musical set in the Prohibition-era South -- and an extremely eclectic soundtrack billed as a proper OutKast album. Big Boi issued a solo album, Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty in 2010, while André 3000 produced and/or appeared on a series of tracks by the likes of John Legend (\"Green Light\"), Beyoncé (\"Party\"), Lloyd (\"Dedication to My Ex [Miss That]),\" and Young Jeezy (\"I Do\"). ~ John Bush, Rovi'\n",

      "'Named after a joint-rolling technique, the British band Toploader evokes the hazy, feel-good vibe of the \\'70s with their keyboard-driven white soul anthems. Keyboardist and vocalist Joseph Washbourne, guitarist Dan Hipgrave, bassist Matt Knight, and drummer Rob Green were friends who, while hanging out night after night in their local pub, decided to form a band. In 1997, after the addition of second guitarist Julian Deane to the lineup, Toploader was born; the following year, the band was signed to Sony\\'s U.K. division. In 1999, with a style reminiscent of the Faces, the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder, and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road-era Elton John, Toploader found themselves supporting former Jam frontman Paul Weller on his European tour. In May of that same year, the driving single \"Achilles Heel\" was released to favorable responses, and Toploader secured spots performing at both the Glastonbury and Reading festivals. Late 1999 saw the release of the second single, \"Let the People Know,\" a joyous, dance-heavy tune which garnered the band comparisons to Jamiroquai. In February 2000, the band would release their most successful single yet, the George Drakoulias-produced \"Dancing in the Moonlight,\" which would remain on the British charts well into 2001. In May 2000, Toploader\\'s first full-length album, Onka\\'s Big Monka, debuted at number five on the British charts and shortly thereafter, the band appeared on the popular television show Top of the Pops alongside Oasis and the Charlatans UK. Their fourth single, \"Just Hold On,\" was released in August 2000. ~ Brandon Gentry, Rovi'\n",

The birth of their latest album came as something of a surprise even to the band. During their time apart, Singer Tom Chaplin had released two successful solo albums. Meanwhile Tim, going through his own personal struggles, found he had written an album's worth of incredibly personal songs fuelled by humour as well as pain.

      "\"Peter Lake is a Canadian born, New York City based singer-songwriter who revels in anonymity. In an age where privacy is rare, Peter is convinced that his ability to create music is protected by his anonymity, and by working with unconventional partners in an attempt to avoid the constraints of traditional record deals, which often consider recorded music as a means to promote tours.Peter is the first of a kind: an artist who will only do live concerts via a web-based platform, thereby freeing him to focus exclusively on writing and recording new, original music that crosses all genres. In the process, Peter has assembled one of the largest singer-songwriter catalogues in the industry. His musical influences include Neil Young, Max Martin, David Bowie, Motown, and Drake.It's no surprise that his songs are hard to place, often flying between (and combining) House beats, crunchy guitar riffs and “traditional chants and natural sounds.”From what we learned in our conversations with the artist, humility does not come naturally. On the other hand, it's hard to consider his views as arrogant, given the intense sincerity with which he describes his plans. When asked about his goal, he replied as follows:“my goal is to wake up every day and make music, and one day through that process write and perform what will later be seen as the greatest song in history, a song that will define humankind for centuries.” We wish you luck on your quest, Peter Lake!\"\n",

      "'St. Louis-raised, Atlanta-based producer Metro Boomin perfected a street-oriented sound that is jet-black and low-gloss, sufficiently reflected in his alias. Within five years of his first output with Future, he amassed well over a dozen Top 20 R&amp;B/hip-hop hits and a similar quantity of gold and platinum RIAA certifications. Since his early half-decade roll of success working with the likes of Future, iLoveMakonnen, Drake, Migos, and Post Malone -- with \"Honest,\" \"Tuesday,\" \"Jumpman,\" \"Bad and Boujee,\" and \"Congratulations\" among the biggest hits -- Metro has remained a marquee name. He crowned the Billboard 200 with Not All Heroes Wear Capes (2018), his first solo album, and made return trips to the top spot with Savage Mode II (a 2020 duo LP with 21 Savage) and his sophomore set Heroes &amp; Villains (2022). He branched out to film in 2023, helming the soundtrack to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.Metro Boomin got into production during his early teens and also rapped, though he eventually opted to devote all his energy to beatmaking. He connected with artists through social media, and prior to graduating high school, he\\'d logged thousands of miles on round trips to Atlanta, where he worked with the likes of OJ da Juiceman and eventually, Gucci Mane and Future. Metro fulfilled his mother\\'s dream with his acceptance to the conveniently located Morehouse College, but he dropped out and invested more in making music than in studying business management.In 2013, Metro\\'s name was on Billboard charts for the first time as the producer of Future\\'s \"Karate Chop\" and \"Honest.\" Just after the latter single was officially released, he self-released 19 &amp; Boomin. Once iLoveMakonnen\\'s \"Tuesday,\" another early triumph, hit the R&amp;B/hip-hop Top Ten the following year, Metro was a constant presence near the top of that chart. Drake and Future\\'s \"Jumpman\" and Future\\'s \"Low Life\" were among the early 2016 hits, followed later in the year by \"X\" -- taken from Savage Mode, his self-released EP made with 21 Savage -- and Migos\\' \"Bad and Boujee,\" which eventually topped the R&amp;B/hip-hop and pop charts. Among Metro Boomin\\'s subsequent hits throughout a notable 2017 were Big Sean\\'s \"Bounce Back,\" Post Malone\\'s \"Congratulations,\" Kodak Black\\'s \"Tunnel Vision,\" and Future\\'s \"Mask Off.\" The year remained a busy one, as Metro later released a trio of collaborative mixtapes: Perfect Timing (with NAV), Without Warning (with Offset and 21 Savage), and Double or Nothing (Big Sean). The following year brought even more success for Metro, not only for his input on notable albums by Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne, but also for his own project, Not All Heroes Wear Capes. The album topped the Billboard 200 upon release in November 2018, and yielded a pair of platinum singles with \"No Complaints,\" featuring Offset and Drake, and \"Space Cadet,\" on which Metro was joined by Gunna. In 2020, Metro Boomin resumed his partnership with 21 Savage and delivered another Billboard 200 topper, Savage Mode II. Four of its tracks, including \"Glock in My Lap,\" hit the Top 40. Metro scored a third Billboard 200 album in 2022 with his sophomore album Heroes &amp; Villains. The set contained another quartet of Top 40 entries, most notably the chart-topping, platinum hit \"Creepin\\',\" a collaboration with the Weeknd and 21 Savage that interpolated Mario Winans\\' \"I Don\\'t Wanna Know.\" He kept the train of number ones rolling in 2023 with the soundtrack to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which arrived that June alongside the animated summer blockbuster. In addition to featuring the likes of Lil Wayne, Offset, Future, James Blake, and many more, the compilation also included the hit single \"Calling\" with Swae Lee, Nav, and A Boogie wit da Hoodie. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi'\n",

      "'A songwriter, composer, and multi-instrumentalist, Gotye (real name Wouter De Backer) earned a global audience in 2011 when his single \"Someone I Used to Know\" became a major international success. Wouter De Backer was born in Bruges, Belgium on May 21, 1980. The De Backer family left Belgium for Australia when Wouter was two years old, finding a home in Sydney before relocating to the Melbourne suburb of Montmorency. When he began attending school, Wouter started using an Anglicized variation of his name, Walter, and before long he revealed he had a talent for music. Becoming proficient on keyboards and drums, De Backer was a teenager when he formed his first band, Downstares, with three of his high-school friends. Once De Backer graduated from high school, Downstares broke up, and after inheriting a large collection of old LPs while attending the University of Melbourne, he began experimenting with sample-based music. In 2001, De Backer released a limited-edition EP, Out Here in the Cold, which he credited to Gotye; the name was a simple phonetic spelling of Gaultier, the French equivalent of Wouter. The EP earned some airplay on Triple J, a noted Australian radio outlet, and De Backer was encouraged to continue making music as Gotye. Around the same time, De Backer became acquainted with singer and songwriter Kris Schroeder, and together they formed a band called the Basics, who released their first album, Get Back, in 2003. While the Basics quickly attracted an audience, De Backer continued to make music as Gotye, and released his first full-length album, Boardface, within months of the Basics\\' debut LP. After moving out of his family\\'s home, De Backer found himself moving frequently over the next several years, while also dividing his time between solo work and the Basics. The nomadic lifestyle was reflected in the sound of the second Gotye album, 2006\\'s Like Drawing Blood, which was a critical and commercial success in Australia, voted the best album of the year in a Triple J listeners\\' poll and earning platinum certification. After establishing a permanent home for his home studio in a barn on his family\\'s property and finding some downtime from the Basics (who released albums in 2007 and 2009), De Backer began the work of creating a third Gotye album, and in 2011 he issued Making Mirrors. The album\\'s first single, \"Eyes Wide Open,\" was a major hit in Australia, but the follow-up, a duet with Kimbra titled \"Someone That I Used to Know,\" became an international smash, with the single topping the charts in the United States, Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and of course Australia, and winning a Grammy Award for Song of the Year. The success of \"Someone I Used to Know\" helped Making Mirrors achieve gold or platinum status in 11 countries, and it won the Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Alternative Album. After the success of Making Mirrors, De Backer returned to the Basics for their 2015 album, The Age of Entitlement, and he launched a personal project, the Ondioline Orchestra, in which he paid tribute to pioneering electronic musician Jean-Jacques Perrey, who was a virtuoso of the Ondioline, a keyboard that could emulate the sound of strings, woodwinds, and other instruments. In 2017, De Backer announced he had founded a new record label, Forgotten Futures, whose first release would be an archival collection of rare Jean-Jacques Perrey recordings. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'Multi-talented and unapologetically flamboyant, CeeLo Green made a name for himself with his soulful trademark crooning as a member of Goodie Mob -- part of Atlanta\\'s prosperous Dungeon Family -- before he broke away in the early 2000s for a colorful and unpredictable career as a solo artist and collaborator. Although Goodie Mob pioneered the Dirty South movement with a string of gold-certified albums, CeeLo has been even more successful since that group\\'s late-\\'90s peak. After his first two solo albums landed within the Top 30 of the Billboard 200, he branched out as the producer of the Pussycat Dolls\\' \"Don\\'t Cha\" (2005) and as one-half of Gnarls Barkley with the Grammy-winning \"Crazy\" (2006). Those two singles, both number two pop hits, were remarkably followed by a number two solo hit in the form of \"Fuck You\" (2010), off CeeLo\\'s Top Ten and multi-platinum third LP, The Lady Killer, which featured another Grammy-winning recording, \"Fool for You.\" The artist\\'s solo discography has since doubled in size and scope with CeeLo\\'s Magic Moment (2012), Heart Blanche (2015), and the instant-vintage CeeLo Green Is Thomas Callaway (2020).Along with Dungeon Family mates OutKast and Organized Noize, Goodie Mob laid out the blueprint for the Dirty South style out of Atlanta during the mid-\\'90s. Before they made serious waves with their 1995 debut album, Soul Food, they were featured on OutKast\\'s \"Call of da Wild\" and the single \"Git Up, Git Out,\" thus also earning the ATL-born CeeLo his first songwriting credits. Shortly thereafter, CeeLo contributed background vocals to TLC\\'s chart-topping \"Waterfalls\" (an Organized Noize production). Soul Food landed in November 1995. CeeLo co-wrote almost all of the songs, and his hooks elevated the Top 40 pop hit \"Cell Therapy\" and the charting title track. After the group\\'s second and third gold-certified, Top Ten R&amp;B/hip-hop albums, CeeLo departed for a promising solo deal with Arista, the parent label of Goodie Mob\\'s recording home, LaFace. Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections arrived in April 2002 and sounded unlike anything else out there, including CeeLo\\'s previous work with Goodie Mob, the output of his neo-soul contemporaries, and pretty much anything else except the weirder corners of OutKast\\'s Stankonia. Promoted with \"Closet Freak,\" CeeLo\\'s first charting solo single, the predominantly self-produced album entered the Billboard 200 at number 11 and at number two on the R&amp;B/hip-hop chart. \"Gettin\\' Grown\" was nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Urban/Alternative Performance.CeeLo returned in March 2004 with Cee-Lo Green...Is the Soul Machine. This follow-up was just as free-spirited as the debut but was more focused and higher in profile, anchored by charting singles produced by Timbaland (\"I\\'ll Be Around\") and Jazze Pha (\"The One\"), with Organized Noize, the Neptunes, and DJ Premier among the other contributors. Interestingly, Arista released the album shortly after parting ways with label president (and LaFace co-founder) L.A. Reid and also after experiencing enormous success with OutKast\\'s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, the adventurous André 3000 half of which sounded quite a bit like CeeLo\\'s work. The same year, CeeLo wrote and produced \"Don\\'t Cha\" for Tori Alamaze. The track reached number 53 on the R&amp;B/hip-hop chart but fared much better when it was re-recorded by the Pussycat Dolls. Also produced by CeeLo, the Pussycat Dolls\\' 2005 version narrowly missed the top of the Hot 100 and was an international smash. Beside Danger Mouse as Gnarls Barkley, CeeLo scored a second number two pop hit the next year with \"Crazy.\" Another global hit, it won a Grammy for Best Urban/Alternative Performance, and its Top Ten parent full-length, St. Elsewhere, took the award for Best Alternative Music Album. A second Gnarls Barkley album, The Odd Couple, arrived in 2008.After reuniting with Goodie Mob for performances across 2008 and 2009, CeeLo recorded his third proper solo album, The Lady Killer. It was preceded by the lead single, \"Fuck You\" (aka \"Forget You\"). Like \"Don\\'t Cha\" and \"Crazy,\" the ebullient kiss-off peaked at number two. The Lady Killer, issued in November 2010, consequently entered the Billboard 200 at number nine, CeeLo\\'s strongest showing. Eventually multi-platinum in numerous countries, \"Fuck You\" led to CeeLo\\'s second Grammy win for Best Urban/Alternative Performance. A subsequent single off The Lady Killer, \"Fool for You,\" became CeeLo\\'s highest solo placement on the R&amp;B/hip-hop chart at number 13 and won Grammys for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance and Best R&amp;B Song. Finally a mainstream star in his own right, CeeLo made several television appearances and, in 2011, became one of the mentors on the U.S. version of the NBC talent contest The Voice. The following year, as he continued to participate in the series, he released a holiday album, CeeLo\\'s Magic Moment. Another LP with Goodie Mob, Age Against the Machine, was issued in 2013. The same year, CeeLo published his autobiography, Everybody\\'s Brother, co-authored with David Wild and Goodie Mob\\'s Big Gipp.Additional television appearances and projects ensued, including a short-lived comedic series for TBS called CeeLo Green\\'s The Good Life. In early 2015, CeeLo returned to solo work with a freely available digital-only EP, TV on the Radio, which consisted of his vocals over television theme songs. A proper album, Heart Blanche, arrived that November with input from an extensive cast including Mark Ronson, Charlie Puth, and Jack Splash. Assorted small-screen projects continued well into 2020, the year he competed on the British version of The Masked Singer. That June, he released his sixth proper solo album, CeeLo Green Is Thomas Callaway, a focused retro-soul set recorded in two days with the Black Keys\\' Dan Auerbach. \"Baby Don\\'t You Go Go,\" a collaboration with legendary Washington, D.C. go-go band Rare Essence, arrived in June 2021. ~ Andy Kellman &amp; Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

Since their No.1 debut album In The Lonely Hour (2014), Smith has amassed a constellation of glittering achievements: 35 million albums sold, 250 million singles, 45 billion multi-platform streams, four Grammys, three BRITs, six MOBOs, a Golden Globe, one Oscar, two No.1 albums, five No.1 singles, two No.1 singles as featured vocalist on club bangers from Naughty Boy (‘La La La\\', 2013) and Calvin Harris (‘Promises\\', alongside Jessie Reyez, 2018). But Gloria is a different kind of achievement, which isn\\'t playing the numbers game. It\\'s the dazzling, sumptuous, sophisticated, unexpected and at times thrillingly edgy sound of Sam Smith\\'s creative heart today. The sound of constricting shackles crashing to the floor, of boundaries joyfully breached, of a still-searching talent discovering what it means to be truly free. It\\'s the sound of now, a diverse, multi-genre mosaic album featuring a trio of female voices from across the globe.'\n",

      "\"Born and raised in L.A., Doja Cat made her first upload to Soundcloud in 2013 at just 16-years-old. She developed a knack for music by studying piano and dance as a kid and listening to the likes of Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, Nicki Minaj, Drake, and more. Soon, she went from obsessing over Catwoman (the Halle Berry version) to “crate digging” on YouTube.  Signed to Kemosabe/RCA during 2014, she unveiled her acclaimed Purrr! EP. Its lead single “So High” impressively racked up over 30 million cumulative streams and garnered praise from tastemakers such as Fader, Vibe, Paper, Pigeons &amp; Planes, and more. Cooking up vibrantly, candy-coated beats, dropping bars doubled-up on double entendre, and singing with claws out, Amala unlocks a sweetly sexy world soundtracked by wild hip-hop, twisted pop, and smoked-out R&amp;B. Asserting a feline-esque dominance and a style that can only be described as every color in a box of crayons, Doja Cat's unapologetic charisma, charm, and confidence immediately take center stage.  In August 2018, she released what would become her viral hit “Mooo!” which enjoyed over 10 million views on YouTube and Twitter in just a couple of days and was met with critical acclaim. In March 2019, she released the Amala Deluxe album which included her brand new song “Juicy.”  With the release of Hot Pink, Doja's ability to create hit records that are uniquely her own are what will continue to make her a standout act in 2019.\"\n",

      "\"On the dance floor in 2009, Caroline Hjelt and Aino Jawo effectively formed Icona Pop. Long before dropping the multiplatinum era-defining anthem “I Love It” [feat. Charli XCX] and skyrocketing to worldwide renown, they crystallized an eternal friendship and creative partnership during their very first Stockholm club evening together. Upon settling in Los Angeles in 2018, Icona Pop drew on those same formative inspirations as they crafted new music. “We took the time to figure out who we are,” says Aino. “After having huge success, a lot of people want to tell you what you should do. For us, it was so important to ask, ‘Who are we?' We figured out who we are right now. We're ten years older. We've been through heartbreaks and tough situations. We have a lot to tell. It's more honest than it's ever been. When we began writing again, we leaned into the dance music we were inspired by in the beginning. It's a new time for us.”In 2019 Icona Pop found the perfect partner in ULTRA and set off with a series of dance floor - ready releases starting with “Next Mistake” - produced by Hudson Mohawke, Nannon Veen, and YARO, the iridescent club pop track glows with warm synths and a hypnotic hook. Since the start of 2020, the group has collaborated with Steve Aoki and Hayden James, with more solo and collaborative music on the way.

      "'After over a decade in the music business, South Korean singer and rapper PSY became a global sensation in the early 2010s with the exuberant and humorous video for his viral hit \"Gangnam Style,\" which inspired international flash mobs, recognition from heads of state, and a slew of parodies on its record-breaking climb to the top of international charts and social media rankings. In the process, PSY helped K-pop edge one step closer into the Western mainstream, as the track was certified multi-platinum in Australia, Europe, and North America. With an image noticeably different from his impeccably manicured and hyper-styled contemporaries, he capitalized on his unique presence on the Asian pop scene and remained a chart fixture in Korea throughout the 2010s, while charting at least three consecutive albums -- Chiljip Psy-da (2015), 4X2=8 (2017), and Psy 9th (2022) -- on the Top Ten of the U.S. World chart.The artist, born Park Jae-Sang, graduated from Boston University and Berklee College of Music and began his music career in 2001 with the album PSY from the PSYcho World! The album\\'s in-your-face lyrics connected with Korean teens but concerned civil groups, causing PSY to pay fines and restrict sales to adults only. He capitalized on the controversy by releasing two more albums, Sa 2 and 3 PSY, a year later, which earned songwriting accolades at the 2004 SBS and Seoul Music Awards. Third album Sa Jib (Sa House) followed in 2006, along with more honors from the SBS Music Awards and M.net KM Music Festival. Aside from his regular recording and performing duties, PSY became a familiar face with appearances on Korean game shows like X-Man and talk shows like Golden Fishery, bringing his flashy style and offbeat charm to the masses. Fifth album PSY Five arrived in 2010 as the artist signed to YG Entertainment, one of Korea\\'s largest talent agencies and record labels, and took home trophies from the Melon, Seoul, and M.net Asian Music Awards ceremonies. PSY kicked off 2011 with Best Album honors from the 20th High1 Seoul Music Festival and by the following spring, he\\'d joined the cast of the Korean televised talent competition Superstar K as a judge. PSY\\'s fame reached international status in summer 2012 with the release of the album Psy 6, Pt. 1, propelled by the single \"Gangnam Style,\" which he immortalized in a video with campy choreography that simulated riding a horse. The video racked up over 2.4 billion views on YouTube and inspired parody clips from all corners of the globe, priming Western audiences for the late 2010s influx of K-pop megastars. He released a second single, \"Gentleman,\" with an accompanying video and dance. Despite never reaching the same pop culture zeitgeist as \"Gangnam,\" PSY spent the following year riding the \"Gangnam\"-wave with live performances and a collaboration with Snoop Dogg on \"Hangover.\" In December 2015, he released two characteristically tongue-in-cheek videos from his seventh album -- the appropriately titled PSY 7th Album (\"Chiljip Psy-da\") -- \"Daddy\" and \"Napal Baji.\" The album included guest appearances by popular Korean singers CL (2NE1), R&amp;B singer Zion.T, XIA (JYJ), rocker Jun In Kwon, and Black Eyed Pea, will.i.am. The entertainer returned with his eighth effort, 4X2=8, in the spring of 2017. The album featured the singles \"I LUV IT\" and \"New Face,\" as well as guests like Big Bang\\'s G-Dragon and Taeyang and IKON\\'s B.I. and Bobby Kim on \"Bomb.\" The following year, he parted ways with YG and, in 2019, founded his own company P Nation, signing a crop of artists including Dawn, Hyuna, and Heize.After an extended absence, the pop idol returned with his ninth album, 2022\\'s synth- and rap-heavy PSY 9th, which included the comeback single \"That That,\" produced and featuring guest SUGA of BTS. While only charting in the Top 40 in Korea, the set became his highest-charting to date in the U.S., peaking at number three on the Billboard World albums chart. ~ Neil Z.

      "'Destiny\\'s Child rose to become one of the most popular female R&amp;B groups of the late \\'90s, eventually rivaling even TLC in terms of blockbuster commercial success. Their accomplishments came in spite of several abrupt personnel changes, which were accompanied by heated, well-publicized feuds in the media and the courts. In fact, for a time, Destiny\\'s Child were known for that drama just as much as their music. Once the group stabilized again, though, they emerged with even more hitmaking power than ever before.Destiny\\'s Child were formed in Houston, Texas, in 1990, when original members Beyoncé Knowles and LaTavia Roberson were just nine years old; the two met at an audition and became friends, and Knowles\\' father Mathew set about developing an act based on their singing and rapping, taking their name from a passage in the Book of Isaiah. Beyoncé\\'s cousin Kelendria \"Kelly\" Rowland joined the group in 1992, and shortly thereafter they landed an appearance on Star Search, where they performed a rap song. The quartet\\'s lineup was finalized (for the time being) when LeToya Luckett joined in 1993, and they spent the next few years working their way up from the Houston club scene, eventually opening for artists like SWV, Dru Hill, and Immature. Finally, in 1997, Destiny\\'s Child were offered a recording contract by Columbia.The group made its recorded debut on 1997\\'s \"Killing Time,\" a song included on the soundtrack of the blockbuster Men in Black. Their self-titled debut album was released in early 1998, featuring production by Wyclef Jean and Jermaine Dupri, among others. Its lead single, the Jean-produced \"No No No,\" was a smash hit, selling over a million copies and topping the R&amp;B charts. The follow-up singles -- \"With Me\" and \"Get on the Bus,\" the latter of which was taken from the soundtrack of Why Do Fools Fall in Love? -- didn\\'t quite duplicate the success of \"No No No,\" although Destiny\\'s Child would eventually go platinum (after the group\\'s later success). Destiny\\'s Child reentered the studio quickly, bringing in producer Kevin \"She\\'kspere\" Briggs to handle the majority of their next record. Lead single \"Bills, Bills, Bills\" became the group\\'s first number one pop hit (and second R&amp;B number one) in the summer of 1999 and, paced by its success, the accompanying album, The Writing\\'s on the Wall, entered the charts at number six upon its release.That was just the beginning of the group\\'s breakout success. The second single, \"Bug a Boo,\" didn\\'t perform as well, but the third single, \"Say My Name,\" was another massive hit, their biggest so far; it hit number one on both the pop and R&amp;B charts for three weeks apiece in early 2000, and made Destiny\\'s Child a pop-cultural phenomenon. However, at the peak of \"Say My Name\"\\'s popularity, the group splintered. In December 1999, Roberson and Luckett attempted to split with manager Mathew Knowles, charging that he kept a disproportionate share of the band\\'s profits, attempted to exert too much control, and unfairly favored his daughter and niece. While they never intended to leave the group, relations naturally grew strained, and when the video for \"Say My Name\" premiered in February 2000, many fans (not to mention Roberson and Luckett) were surprised to find two new members -- Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin -- joining Knowles and Rowland. Infuriated, Roberson and Luckett took legal action in March, suing both Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. A war of words followed in the press; meanwhile, the next Destiny\\'s Child single, \"Jumpin\\' Jumpin\\',\" hit the Top Ten, and The Writing\\'s on the Wall went on to sell a whopping eight million copies.The personnel-turnover drama still wasn\\'t over; in July 2000, just five months after joining, Farrah Franklin split with the group. The official reason was that Franklin missed several promotional appearances and concert gigs, although in later interviews she spoke of too much negativity and too little control in the group environment. Now reduced to a trio, Destiny\\'s Child was tapped to record the theme song for the film version of Charlie\\'s Angels; released as a single in October, \"Independent Women, Pt. 1\" raced up the charts and spent an astounding 11 weeks at number one. Destiny\\'s Child were now indisputable superstars, the biggest female R&amp;B group on the scene, and they quickly began work on a new album to capitalize. In the meantime, toward the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they continued to pursue action against Knowles\\' father; as part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from ripping each other publicly.Beyoncé had long since emerged as the group\\'s focal point, and on the third Destiny\\'s Child album, she assumed more control than ever before, taking a greater hand in writing the material and even producing some of the record herself. While recording sessions were going on, Rowland released the first Destiny\\'s Child solo track; \"Angel\" appeared on the soundtrack of Chris Rock\\'s Down to Earth. Former members Roberson and Luckett also announced the formation of a trio called, coincidentally, Angel, and Farrah Franklin set about starting a solo career.Survivor -- whose title was reportedly inspired by a DJ\\'s crack about Destiny\\'s Child members voting one another off the island, much like the popular CBS reality series -- hit stores in the spring of 2001, and entered the charts at number one. The first two singles, \"Survivor\" and \"Bootylicious,\" were predictably huge hits, with the latter becoming the group\\'s fourth number one pop single. A cover of Andy Gibb\\'s \"Emotion\" was also successful, albeit less so, and Survivor sold well -- over four million copies -- but not as well as its predecessor. Toward the end of the year, the group released a holiday album, 8 Days of Christmas, and announced plans for a series of side projects, including solo albums from all three members (to be staggered over the next year and a half, so as to avoid competition). In early 2002, shortly after This Is the Remix was released to tide fans over, Roberson and Luckett sued the group again, claiming that some of the lyrics in \"Survivor\" made reference to them (in violation of the earlier lawsuit settlement). The first Destiny\\'s Child solo album, Michelle Williams\\' all-gospel project Heart to Yours, was released in April and featured a duet with gospel legend Shirley Caesar. Meanwhile, Beyoncé won a leading role opposite Mike Myers in the third Austin Powers film, Goldmember, playing blaxploitation-style heroine Foxy Cleopatra; her first solo single, the Neptunes-produced \"Work It Out,\" appeared on the soundtrack, and her full solo album, Dangerously in Love, became a huge hit upon release in mid-2003. Despite much critical speculation, the trio reunited the following year and released Destiny Fulfilled in November 2004. In October 2005, the #1\\'s compilation was issued, followed by the Live in Atlanta DVD and CD sets in 2006 and 2007. The members continued solo careers. Rowland had considerable success with Ms. Kelly and Here I Am, both of which reached the Top Ten. Meanwhile, Beyoncé, who married Jay-Z in 2008, solidified her status as the planet\\'s biggest pop star with the platinum albums B\\'day, I Am...Sasha Fierce, and 4. The group reunited in 2012 to record a new song, the Pharrell-produced \"Nuclear,\" for the Love Songs compilation, which was released in January 2013 -- just prior to their halftime performance at Super Bowl XLVII. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "'Award-winning performer and Grammy-nominated songwriter Tove Lo crafts raw, confessional pop shaped by her love of grunge and the pristine sounds of her Swedish homeland. The way her 2013 single \"Habits (Stay High)\" swung between joy and despair and frankly depicted drug use and sex made it a distinctive, relatable, multi-platinum hit and a fitting introduction to her uncensored style. She followed it with more uninhibited, confessional music: Her 2014 debut album, Queen of the Clouds, and 2017\\'s BLUE LIPS upheld her reputation for confronting the darker side of love and relationships with thoughtful, provocative, and catchy songwriting. On 2019\\'s Sunshine Kitty, she took a slightly more lighthearted approach without losing any of her edge, while 2022\\'s Dirt Femme lended nuance to her concept of femininity. An in-demand collaborator, Lo worked with the likes of Coldplay, Charli XCX, and Nick Jonas; as a songwriter, her credits include songs for Lorde and Icona Pop, as well as Ellie Goulding\\'s 2015 Grammy-nominated hit \"Love Me Like You Do.\" Tove Lo was born Ebba Tove Elsa Nilsson on October 29, 1987, in a suburb of Stockholm. When she was three, her godmother gave her the nickname Tove Lo after a lynx the young Nilsson loved at the local zoo (\"lo\" is Swedish for lynx). She began writing poetry and short stories at a young age, and had written her first songs by the time she was 11. While growing up, she was fascinated by the rawness of Courtney Love\\'s and Kurt Cobain\\'s music and by their relationship, and also found inspiration in the work of Robyn, Lykke Li, Jeff Buckley, and Charlotte Gainsbourg. She went on to study at the famous Rytmus Musikergymnasiet -- a music-oriented high school comparable to the U.K.\\'s BRIT School -- where she befriended Caroline Hjelt, a future member of the duo Icona Pop. After graduation in 2006, Lo began making music with other Rytmus alumni in the math rock band Tremblebee. When the quintet broke up in 2009, Lo decided to focus on her own songs, spending six months in her shed studio recording her demo while working as a session singer.At a party celebrating Icona Pop\\'s first record deal, she used the opportunity to give her demo to a staff member at their label, leading to a publishing deal with Warner Chappell and a trip to L.A. to work with fellow Swede and pop songwriting/production supremo Max Martin, who became a mentor and frequent collaborator. In October 2012, Lo self-released her debut single, \"Love Ballad,\" a catchy, beat-driven pop track that showcased her powerful voice. It was followed in 2013 by \"Habits (Stay High),\" a dark breakup anthem that generated such Internet buzz that it led to a deal with Universal. \"Habits\" and its follow-up, \"Out of Mind,\" which was in much the same vein, appeared on her debut EP for the label, Truth Serum, in 2014. The EP reached number 13 on the Swedish Albums Chart, while \"Habits\" peaked at 13 on the Swedish Singles Chart and hit number six in the U.K. During this time, Lo also established herself as a songwriter, collaborating on tracks for Icona Pop and Victoria Justice. In September 2014 her debut album, Queen of the Clouds, arrived, featuring \"Habits\" -- which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 -- as well as other raw, confessional songs about love and heartache. The record was a Top Ten hit in Sweden and a Top 20 hit in the U.S. and U.K., and the subsequent single \"Talking Body\" was a similar success. Lo\\'s 2014 collaboration with Alesso, \"Heroes (We Could Be),\" was another hit, reaching the top of the U.S. dance chart and becoming a Top Ten hit in Sweden and the U.K. In late 2014, she contributed a song to The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Pt. 1. She also was part of Martin\\'s Wolf Cousins songwriting collective and co-wrote songs for Cher Lloyd, Lea Michele, and the Saturdays.In January 2015, Lo underwent surgery for cysts on her vocal cords and couldn\\'t sing for two months while she recovered. That month also saw the release of Ellie Goulding\\'s \"Love Me Like You Do,\" a song Lo co-wrote with Martin and others for the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. It became a number one hit in the U.K. and a Top Ten hit in the U.S., and later earned a nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 58th Grammy Awards. Lo also won a pair of her homeland\\'s Grammis in 2015, Artist of the Year and Song of the Year for \"Habits (Stay High).\" Following the release of a deluxe version of Queen of the Clouds, she embarked on her first headlining tour. Late that year, she lent her vocals to Coldplay\\'s seventh album, A Head Full of Dreams.Lo\\'s busy 2016 included collaborations with Broods and Flume, while her single with Nick Jonas, \"Close,\" became a Top 20 hit in Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S, where it was certified platinum. She also co-wrote another song for Goulding, \"Still Falling for You,\" from the soundtrack to Bridget Jones\\' Baby, and contributed the song \"Scars\" to The Divergent Series: Allegiant soundtrack. In October 2016, Lo returned with her second album, Lady Wood, which delivered more of her signature mix of cool synth pop and frank lyrics. Buoyed by the singles \"Cool Girl\" and \"True Disaster,\" the set hit number one in Sweden, and landed at number 11 on the U.S. Billboard 200. In 2017, Lo contributed the song \"Lies in the Dark\" to the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack and co-wrote the Lorde song \"Homemade Dynamite.\" That November, she released her third album, BLUE LIPS, a companion piece to Lady Wood that featured the single \"Disco Tits.\" The album reached number 138 on the Billboard 200 and number 15 in Sweden. Lo created two short films featuring songs from BLUE LIPS, Fire Fade and Fairy Dust. In December, she appeared on \"Out of My Head,\" a track from Charli XCX\\'s mixtape Pop 2. In June 2018, Lo returned the favor, releasing a remix of BLUE LIPS\\' \"bitches\" that featured XCX along with Icona Pop, Alma, and Elliphant. Lo\\'s fourth album, Sunshine Kitty, arrived in September 2019. Featuring collaborations with Kylie Minogue and Jax Jones, its songs reflected Lo\\'s happier, more confident frame of mind. A top 20 hit in Sweden, the album reached number 61 in the U.S. and 59 in the U.K. The video for the Sunshine Kitty single \"Glad He\\'s Gone\" was nominated in the Best Music Video category of the 62nd Grammy Awards. A string of stand-alone singles followed, including \"Bikini Porn\" and an English cover of the song \"Jag kommer\" that became a top 40 hit in Sweden; these songs, along with previously unreleased material, appeared on May 2020\\'s deluxe Paw Prints edition of Sunshine Kitty. She also paired with Sean Paul on the clubby single \"Calling On Me.\" While working on her next album, Lo appeared in the film adaptation of Vilhelm Moberg\\'s 1949 novel The Emigrants and collaborated with Martin Garrix on the 2021 single \"Pressure.\" The first taste of her fifth album arrived in early 2022 with \"How Long,\" which appeared on the soundtrack Euphoria: Music from the HBO Original Series. That August, Lo executive produced Pussy Riot\\'s debut mixtape, while her own album Dirt Femme was released in October. Her first album on her own Pretty Swede label, it found her reclaiming the softer side of her femininity and harked back to the danceable sounds of her earlier releases with contributions from SG Lewis, First Aid Kit, and Channel Tres. It reached 11 on Sweden\\'s Album Chart and 24 on Billboard\\'s Top Independent Albums Chart. Several standalone singles appeared in early 2023, including \"Borderline\" (co-written with Dua Lipa) and \"I Like U.\" ~ Heather Phares &amp; John D. Buchanan'\n",

      "\"Making the world smaller by making the party bigger: this is Major Lazer's mission. Since its debut in 2009, the trio led by Diplo has consistently affirmed its desire to celebrate cultures, to uplift artists and genres from around the world and to create a new kind of electronic music.The breadth of international artists that we find across Major Lazer's albums—from Guns Don't Kill People...Lazers Do, to their latest Music Is The Weapon—illustrates this ethos. This desire to free oneself from codes, to break down barriers, is at the heart of Music is the Weapon. Released in October 2020 this new LP is carried by a list of prestigious names, with universes that could not be more varied. Among them: reggaeton superstar J. Balvin, American rap queen Nicki Minaj, in addition to French Montana, Skip Marley, Khalid, Mr Eazi, Nucleya, Paloma Mami, Anitta, and Shenseea , the new star of Jamaican dancehall and many more..By drawing together the international influences of reggaeton and afrobeats, Music is the Weapon is a record in tune with its time, whose frenetic rhythms marry genres with ever more power; dance music to dancehall, pop to dembow, soca to hip-hop. It is an album that projects us to the four corners of the globe, and whose title takes on an almost political meaning: at the end of a year marked by isolation and the restriction of our freedoms, music seems to be a considerable weapon, more capable than ever of bringing us together across borders.\"\n",

      "'Selena Gomez is a multi-talented performer with featured roles on the screen, both small and big, and a musical career that reached the summit of the charts from the very beginning and stayed planted there for many years. Her group Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene issued a trio of breezy modern pop albums from 2009 to 2011 that each hit the Top Ten. After going solo, she scored a pair of number ones with the more adult-oriented Stars Dance (2013) and Revival (2015), then branched out into new sounds on collaborations with Kygo (\"It Ain\\'t Me\") and Marshmello (\"Wolves\"). Gomez reached the top of the singles chart for the first time with \"Lose You to Love Me\" (2019), a soul-searching ballad that delved into her real-life relationships and marked a new openness in her lyrical approach. In 2021, she took on Latin pop for the first time with the Revelación EP. Along with her starring role in Hulu\\'s Only Murders in the Building, she was also the subject of the candid 2022 documentary Selena Gomez: My Mind &amp; Me, for which she also released the title-track, followed by 2023\\'s electronic-tinged \"Single Soon.\"Born in 1992, Gomez grew up in Texas and got her first break as a cast member on the kids\\' TV show Barney and Friends. She landed minor roles in several other TV programs, but it was her affiliation with the Disney Channel -- which discovered her during a nationwide talent search in 2004 -- that officially jump-started her acting career. Guest appearances on The Suite Life of Zach and Cody and Hannah Montana paved the way for Gomez\\'s own show, The Wizards of Waverly Place, which premiered in October 2007 and quickly became one of the network\\'s most popular programs. Gomez began juggling her commitment to The Wizards of Waverly Place with additional projects, including movie roles and a burgeoning singing career. She began branching out into pop music by recording songs for her own Disney projects. She sang the theme song for The Wizards of Waverly Place, recorded several other tunes for the show\\'s soundtrack, and performed on the soundtrack of the family film Another Cinderella Story. By 2009, she\\'d also assembled her own teen pop band, Selena Gomez &amp; the Scene, and signed a contract with Hollywood Records. The band\\'s full-length debut, Kiss &amp; Tell, was released that year and went gold, as did its 2010 follow-up, A Year Without Rain. Gomez continued filming The Wizards of Waverly Place and made her theatrical debut in the 2010 film adaptation of Ramona and Beezus, but her music garnered just as much attention. When The Wizards of Waverly Place started airing its final season in November 2010, Gomez shifted her attention back to her band, whose third album, When the Sun Goes Down, was recorded in early 2011 and released later that year. She then took a break from music to focus more on acting, with her first role in a decidedly adult movie in 2013\\'s Spring Breakers showing she could stretch beyond teen stardom. Her return to music in 2013 with her fourth album -- but the first credited to her as a solo artist -- also showed some stretching as she added dubstep, R&amp;B, and EDM to her sound. Stars Dance was released in July 2013 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The rest of that year was a bit challenging for her, as she fired her management team and parted ways with Hollywood Records. She soon bounced back, though, and scored a deal with Interscope. One last Hollywood album, a contract-fulfilling hits collection titled For You, was released in late 2014 and featured the self-penned platinum single \"The Heart Wants What It Wants.\"In early 2015, Gomez guested on Zedd\\'s hit EDM single \"I Want You to Know.\" On the heels of that success, she released her own single, the Sir Nolan- and Nick Monson-produced \"Good for You,\" which featured a guest appearance by the song\\'s co-writer, rapper A$AP Rocky. The song featured on the 2015 album Revival, her first for Interscope. With production by Mattman &amp; Robin, Hit-Boy, and Benny Blanco, among others, and songwriting credits for Charli XCX, Julia Michaels, and Chloe Angelides, the album had many collaborators. Gomez executive produced, though, and shared writing credits on six songs, making it her most personal effort to date. It entered the Billboard 200 at the top and spawned three singles that reached the Top Ten on the Top 40 chart. While touring in support of Revival, Gomez cut the trek short to address personal health problems stemming from her lupus, later revealing that during her time away from the spotlight she underwent a kidney transplant. Re-emerging at the end of 2016, she collaborated on singles with Kygo (\"It Ain\\'t Me\") and Marshmello (\"Wolves\"), both charting in the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 2017. The next year was a busy one for Gomez as she acted in the movie A Rainy Day in New York, served as executive producer of the Netflix show 13 Reasons Why, and worked with Marshmello on the Top 20 single \"Wolves.\" She also issued the solo singles \"Bad Liar\" and \"Fetish,\" which featured rapper Gucci Mane. In 2018, she contributed the song \"Back to You\" to the 13 Reasons Why: Season 2 soundtrack, joined with DJ Snake, Cardi B, and Ozuna on \"Taki Taki,\" and sang the hook on Benny Blanco\\'s single \"I Can\\'t Get Enough.\" While working on an album in 2019, she also executive-produced the HBO series Living Undocumented and appeared in the Jim Jarmusch zombie comedy The Dead Don\\'t Die. Near the end of the year, she released the confessional ballad \"Lose You to Love Me,\" and it became her first single to reach the top of the Billboard charts. The song set the tone for her sixth album, Rare, a collection of tracks that explored aspects of Gomez\\'s life in ways her previous work hadn\\'t. It featured the usual crop of heavy-hitters behind the scenes, including Mattman &amp; Robin, Justin Tranter, and Julia Michaels, and entered the Billboard 200 at number one in January 2020. The following year saw Gomez issue her first full-length Spanish-language project, the Grammy-nominated Revelación EP, which featured contributions from DJ Snake, Myke Towers, and Rauw Alejandro. In 2021, she began starring in the Hulu mystery-comedy show Only Murders in the Building with Steve Martin and Martin Short. She was also the subject of director Alek Keshishian\\'s 2022 documentary Selena Gomez: My Mind &amp; Me. The film followed Gomez over a six-year period and detailed her struggles with fame, as well as her physical and mental health issues in the wake of being diagnosed with lupus bipolar disorder. As part of the documentary, she released the single \"My Mind &amp; Me.\" The Benny Blanco and Cashmere Cat-produced non-album track, \"Single Soon,\" arrived in August 2023. ~ Matt Collar &amp; Andrew Leahey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Multi-platinum trio Echosmith's choice to self-title their third album is a declaration of sorts. It represents Sydney, Noah and Graham Sierota's fresh perspective and newly liberated approach as they lean into a sonic shift and bare-it-all songwriting that came from the kind of questions and anxieties that we all can feel at times when taking stock of our lives and thinking about what's next.As seasoned musicians with a decade of discography, they've achieved over 1 billion streams, international success, a ubiquitous hit song with “Cool Kids,” widespread critical acclaim, and performed countless sold out shows. After starting their careers so young and absorbing the influences and pressures of the industry, the band began to tap into their innermost artistic vision and ask themselves what kind of music they truly wanted to make. By leaning deeply into the inherent risk of challenging expectations that were set for them and boldly engaging the profound uncertainty of undergoing a self-imposed artistic evolution, they took full creative control of their career with a newfound freedom and independence. Beginning with songwriting and producing solo (a first for the band), they found a form of therapy and a sense of enjoyment as they saw what organically transpired. The result is a left of-center pop kaleidoscope of cinematic alternative soundscapes, breezy pop hooks, resonant stories, and crystalline synths that embody the original indie spirit of the band.\"\n",

      "'A perfect balance of pop hooks, effortless charm, and stoner rap swagger, Pittsburgh rapper Wiz Khalifa was one of the highest-rising stars of a certain sect of mainstream hip-hop in the 2010s. With a series of hits built around slick rhymes and slicker production, Khalifa moved from mixtapes to stadium anthems and even major motion-picture soundtrack collaborations with pop star Charlie Puth. His charm, persona, and weedy wit have been in peak form from the time of his major-label debut, 2011\\'s Rolling Papers, to 2022\\'s more mature Multiverse.A military brat, Khalifa, whose real name is Cameron Thomaz, was born in 1987 in Minot, North Dakota. After his parents divorced when he was three, he lived in various places and military bases around the world. His first attempt at committing lyrics to paper was around age nine, and at 12 he was already recording and producing his own records in his father\\'s Oklahoma studio. Settling in Pittsburgh during his high school years, Khalifa laid down the groundwork for a solo career and kept busy recording music in a local studio, I.D. Labs. He stood out among the studio\\'s regulars, prompting the I.D. Labs\\' staff to offer him free beats and recording time, and brought him to the attention of Benjy Grinberg, a former executive assistant to L.A. Reid at Arista who had started a new independent label, Rostrum Records. Signed to Rostrum, Khalifa built a buzz in Pittsburgh with a few singles, but drew attention nationally during his senior year in high school when his first mixtape, Prince of the City: Welcome to Pistolvania, appeared in early 2006. With the release of his independent full-length debut, Show and Prove, later that year, major publications featured profiles on the young rapper.In summer 2007, Khalifa and Rostrum hopped on board with Warner and Khalifa cut his first major-label single, \"Young\\'n on His Grind.\" The follow-up, \"Say Yeah,\" climbed into the Top 20 of Billboard\\'s Hot Rap Tracks that same year, but the relationship between Warner Bros. and Khalifa took a turn for the worse. Unable to come to an agreement on his debut album for the label, the rapper announced he was leaving Warner in 2009 and returning to Rostrum for the album Deal or No Deal. The next year began with Khalifa appearing on the cover of XXL as one of the magazine\\'s Top Ten Freshmen, while The Source named him Rookie of the Year. In April, his Kush &amp; Orange Juice mixtape had received enough press that Atlantic took notice, signing the artist that same month, and in September, his first single for the label, the Pittsburgh Steelers tribute and Stargate production \"Black and Yellow,\" appeared. As the NFL team progressed toward the playoffs, Khalifa\\'s track became their unofficial anthem, and when the Green Bay Packers emerged as the team\\'s opponent for the Super Bowl, Lil Wayne responded with the answer song \"Green and Yellow.\" Khalifa\\'s song topped the charts in February 2011, while his first Atlantic set, Rolling Papers, debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart a month later. Also arriving that same year was a feature film with Snoop Dogg, Mac and Devin Go to High School, along with its accompanying soundtrack. Two mixtapes, Taylor Allderdice and Still Blazin\\', landed in 2012, and in early December his fourth album, O.N.I.F.C., was released, featuring a return appearance by production team Stargate, this time working with Benny Blanco on the album\\'s first single, \"Work Hard, Play Hard.\" Khalifa explained in interviews that the acronym title O.N.I.F.C. stood for \"Only Nigga in First Class,\" inspired by the album H.N.I.C. by Prodigy of Mobb Deep. Clean copies saw the abbreviation standing for \"One Night in First Class.\" In April 2013, he released his collaborative EP Live in Concert with Curren$y, which featured seven new songs. Shortly afterward, he announced the details of a fifth studio album titled Blacc Hollywood, which was released in August 2014. The mixtape 28 Grams -- designed to act as a primer for the album -- almost saw a delay when Khalifa was arrested for marijuana possession the day before its release that May. However, he was freed within a matter of hours and the mixtape\\'s online stream went ahead as planned. During 2015, his contribution to the soundtrack for Furious 7 became one of the biggest hits of the year; a tribute to the actor Paul Walker, \"See You Again,\" reigned at number one for more than ten weeks (although not consecutively). The hit didn\\'t appear on the MC\\'s 2016 album, Khalifa, but it influenced the more serene and loose set of tracks, including the record\\'s lead single \"Bake Sale\" with special guest Travis Scott. The album debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 album chart, while later in the year Wiz debuted at number 26 with TGOD Mafia: Rude Awakening, a collaborative mixtape featuring Juicy J and TM88 and released by Atlantic. The rapper followed with a pair of notable soundtrack contributions in 2016 (\"Sucker for Pain\" from the movie Suicide Squad) and 2017 (\"Gang Up\" from The Fate of the Furious). Also in 2017, he delivered the single \"Something New,\" featuring Ty Dolla $ign. Another mixtape, Laugh Now, Flay Later, was issued before year\\'s end.In 2018, Wiz released the single \"Hopeless Romantic\" with Swae Lee b/w \"Real Rich\" with Gucci Mane. Both tracks appeared on his sequel Rolling Papers 2, which arrived that summer. Khalifa returned in February 2019 with the Trippie Red and Preme collaboration \"Alright,\" and revisited his collaborative friendship with Curren$y for the nostalgic mixtape 2009 and the cloudy, old-school-tinged Fly Times, Vol. 1: The Good Fly Young. These more offhanded and casual mixtape releases were followed in 2020 by the brief but manicured production of the seven-song EP The Saga of Wiz Khalifa. In addition to strongly stylized pop production, the EP included high-profile features from Logic, Quavo, Tyga, Megan Thee Stallion, and more. After devoting much of the next few years to collaborations and rapid-fire mixtape releases like the Juicy J joint project Stoner\\'s Night and the quadruple-threat Full Court Press with Smoke DZA, Girl Talk, and Big K.R.I.T., Wiz returned in July 2022 with his seventh solo studio album, Multiverse. Recorded primarily in Khalifa\\'s home studio in Los Angeles, the set was a more mature outing for the rapper, and dealt with lyrical themes of self-acceptance, fatherhood, and emotional growth. Khalifa kicked off 2023 with a string of wide-ranging singles, including \"#NeverDrinkingAgain\" and the Ty Dolla $ign-produced \"Don\\'t Text Don\\'t Call,\" which featured a guest spot from Snoop Dogg. ~ Cyril Cordor, Rovi'\n",

      "\"With the release of her highly anticipated sophomore album ‘Happier Than Ever,' the 19-year-old Los Angeles native remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Since the release of her debut single “ocean eyes” in 2015, Eilish continues to shatter the ceiling of music with her genre-defying sound. Fast forward from her humble breakout, her album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in the U.S as well as 17 additional countries around the world upon release in 2019, and was the most streamed album of that year.

Billie Eilish went on to make history as the youngest artist to receive nominations and win in all the major categories at the 62nd GRAMMY Awards, receiving an award for Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album. Billie Eilish is also the youngest artist to write and record an official James Bond theme song, ‘No Time To Die.'

Produced by and co-written with Daniel Nigro (her main creative partner on SOUR), each song intensifies the emotional honesty that's always imbued her storytelling. Rodrigo expands her expressive palette, uncovering entirely new dimensions of her artistry, as exemplified by lead single “vampire.” Hailed by Pitchfork as the “Best New Track” upon release, “vampire” debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 – as did SOUR hits “drivers license” and “good 4 u,” making Rodrigo the first artist ever to debut the lead singles from two career-opening albums atop the prestigious chart. The 20-year-old is the youngest artist in Hot 100 history to debut three hits at No. 1. Named the #1 Album of 2021 by Rolling Stone and hailed as one of the Best Albums of 2021 by The New York Times, among others, SOUR is now triple Platinum in the U.S. and has sold over 16.8 million global album adjusted units with over 66 billion streams worldwide.

      "\"Reneé Rapp knew she was born to perform ever since she was a child. Even in her earliest memories, her love of music was always present. “I couldn't sit still in the car unless there was music,” she says. “Otherwise, I would cry the entire time.” The North Carolina native began harnessing her natural creativity by writing and recording songs when she was just a teenager. Eventually, her career took off when she landed the coveted role of Regina George in the Tony-nominated Mean Girls musical on Broadway. Shortly after, she found widespread recognition and praise—from the likes of W, Harper's Bazaar, and The Hollywood Reporter for her performance as “Leighton” on the HBO Max series “The Sex Lives of College Girls” written by Mindy Kaling. Now, more empowered than ever, Rapp now turns her attention back to music, where sharing threadbare insecurities on “Tattoos” is just the beginning. “I was called emotional a lot growing up because I didn't know what was going on with me,” she says. “As I got older and started going to therapy, I reclaimed the word in a way that feels good to me.” In this song and in the rest of her music to come Rapp leans into a uniquely bold showcase of vulnerability to connect with her ever growing fandom. Eager to continue to share her emotions with the world, Reneé has much more music on the way under her recent signing to Interscope Records.\"\n",

      "'Lana Del Rey is one part songwriting superpower, one part constructed character, building a Southern California dream world of manufactured melancholy and genuine glamour in her stylized, meticulously arranged noir-pop songs and becoming an incredibly influential indie superstar in the process. Del Rey\\'s sound and persona were in their rudimentary forms on her 2012 debut album, Born to Die, but both became more personal with subsequent releases. Her popularity grew after a hit remix of her single \"Summertime Sadness\" and her second LP, 2014\\'s Ultraviolence, received positive reviews to accompany her sales. By the time of albums like 2019\\'s Grammy-nominated Norman Fucking Rockwell!, 2021\\'s Blue Banisters, and 2023\\'s Did you know that there\\'s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd, Del Rey\\'s character of the damaged torch singer and tragic romantic icon had become nuanced and complex, and her increasingly orchestrated and often cuttingly direct songwriting had evolved in tandem.Lana Del Rey\\'s journey to this stardom was a long, steady climb. Born Elizabeth Woolridge Grant in New York City to a pair of wealthy parents, she was raised in Lake Placid, not starting to pursue music until she was out of high school and living with her aunt and uncle on Long Island. Her uncle taught her how to play guitar, and soon she was writing songs and playing New York clubs, sometimes under the name Lizzy Grant. While she attended Fordham University, she continued to play music, and she started getting serious around 2005. In April of that year, a CD of originals was registered under her birth name with the U.S. Copyright Office and recorded elsewhere, finishing up an unreleased folky album called Sirens under the name May Jailer. Reverting to the name Lizzy Grant, she signed with 5 Points Records in 2006, recording an EP called Kill Kill with producer David Kahne, who would prove to be her first pivotal collaborator. Kill Kill appeared digitally in 2008, and over the next two years, Grant became Lana Del Rey, digitally releasing a full self-titled album under that name in 2010. Not long after its release, she teamed with managers Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, who helped her separate from 5 Points (rights to her recordings reverted back to her), and she moved to England, where she began crafting the Lana Del Rey persona.The first unveiling of Lana Del Rey arrived in 2011 via YouTube videos that quickly became a viral sensation, led by the moody, murky \"Video Games\" and followed by \"Blue Jeans.\" Much of her success was limited to the Internet, but it soon started to spill over into U.K. pop culture. By the fall of that year, she released \"Video Games\" on Stranger Records, an independent division of Interscope/Polydor in the U.K., and she won the Next Big Thing trophy at the Q Awards. Del Rey\\'s full-fledged debut album, Born to Die, appeared to considerable anticipation in January 2012. Greeted by mixed reviews, Born to Die\\'s launch also suffered a setback after Del Rey\\'s halting appearance on Saturday Night Live on in January 2012, but that apparent stumble ultimately had the effect of raising her profile, and soon Born to Die became a steady seller. That November, Del Rey released the Paradise EP -- at eight tracks and 33 minutes, it was essentially a mini-LP; some pressings bundled Paradise with Born to Die -- which, supported by the single \"Ride,\" charted at ten in the U.S. Throughout 2013, various singles and videos surfaced -- these included a cover of Leonard Cohen\\'s \"Chelsea Hotel #2,\" as well as a cover of Lee Hazlewood\\'s \"Summer Wine\" performed with her then-boyfriend, Barrie-James O\\'Neill -- but her biggest release of the year was the new song \"Young and Beautiful,\" penned for Baz Luhrmann\\'s adaptation of The Great Gatsby. Ultimately, this single was overshadowed by Cedric Gervais\\' remix of Born to Die\\'s \"Summertime Sadness,\" a remix that turned the song into her first Top Ten hit in the U.S. At the end of 2013, Del Rey released a short film called Tropico, which was accompanied by an EP of the same name. All of these releases -- including a cover of the Disney standard \"Once Upon a Dream\" for the Disney film Maleficent -- kept Del Rey in the spotlight as she worked on her second album. Del Rey hired Dan Auerbach, the leader of Ohio blues-rockers the Black Keys, to produce the majority of Ultraviolence, the sophomore set that appeared in June 2014, preceded by the singles \"West Coast,\" \"Shades of Cool,\" \"Ultraviolence,\" and \"Brooklyn Baby.\" The album found a more receptive initial audience than Born to Die: not only were the reviews positive, but so were the sales, with the LP debuting at number one in both the U.S. and the U.K. Ultimately, Ultraviolence didn\\'t generate hits as big as Born to Die, but it performed the crucial task of elevating Del Rey\\'s critical reputation, illustrated by her selection to sing the title song for Tim Burton\\'s 2014 bid for an Oscar, Big Eyes. Del Rey wasted no time following Ultraviolence. In early 2015, she worked on a third full-length album, and she co-headlined a summer tour with Courtney Love. Preceded by the singles \"High by the Beach\" and \"Terrence Loves You,\" the album, titled Honeymoon, saw release that September. It topped the charts in a handful of countries, peaking at number two on the Billboard 200. In addition to touring in support of Honeymoon, she contributed vocals to the Weeknd\\'s chart-topping third LP, Starboy, and began recording for her own follow-up. In early 2017, she released \"Love,\" the first single from her fourth full-length effort, Lust for Life, which arrived that July. Along with debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, the record earned Del Rey her second Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album. The following year, she began rolling out singles in advance of her fifth album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, beginning with \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" and \"Venice Bitch.\" The trickle of new music continued throughout 2019 with a steady stream of new songs, some one-offs, and some album tracks. After ramping up excitement for the record with a cover of Sublime\\'s \"Doin\\' Time\" and a two-part joint single, \"Fuck It I Love You\"/\"The Greatest,\" Norman Fucking Rockwell! was released in late August 2019. It received Grammy nominations for Album of the Year as well as Song of the Year for the title track. The following year, Del Rey issued Violet Bent Backwards over the Grass, a book of poetry that also yielded a spoken word album of the same name. The official follow-up to Norman Fucking Rockwell!, Chemtrails over the Country Club, appeared in March 2021. Only a few months later, Del Rey released three more singles including the song \"Blue Banisters\" from her forthcoming album of the same name. Blue Banisters arrived in October of that year, featuring production on some songs from Kanye West and Kid Cudi producer Mike Dean. It reached number eight on the Billboard 200. In December 2022, she landed in the Top 40 of the Hot Rock &amp; Alternative Songs chart with \"Did you know that there\\'s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd,\" the Jack Antonoff, Drew Erickson, and Zach Dawes-produced title track off her ninth album. Two more songs were issued as singles in advance of the record before its release in March 2023. In addition to contributions from the producers, Did you know that there\\'s a tunnel under Ocean Blvd included featured appearances from Father John Misty, Jon Batiste, SYML, Riopy, Tommy Genesis, and backing on the song \"Margaret\" from Antonoff\\'s band Bleachers. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'With a knack for scoring dramatic commercial ballads and straightforward dance-pop numbers alike, Jason Derulo shot to stardom while still in his teens. He built his reputation as a prolific R&amp;B and rap songwriter, composing tracks for artists ranging from Lil Wayne and Pitbull to Pleasure P. Signed to a Warner Bros. subsidiary, he scored a surprise late-summer jam in 2009 when the Imogen Heap-sampling, Auto-Tuned reimagining of \"Whatcha Say\" off 2010\\'s Jason Derulo soared to the top of the Billboard Hot 100. With albums like 2011\\'s Future History and 2013\\'s Tattoos, he was soon a mainstay on the chart\\'s Top Ten, scoring with \"In My Head,\" \"Ridin\\' Solo,\" \"Talk Dirty\" (featuring 2 Chainz), and \"Wiggle\" (featuring Snoop Dogg). In 2015, he reached number four on the Billboard 200 with Everything Is 4, featuring the Top Five Hot 100 hit \"Want to Want Me.\" More standalone tracks followed, including the 2018 FIFA World Cup anthem \"Colors\" (with Maluma), 2020\\'s \"Savage Love\" (with Jawsh 685), 2021\\'s \"Lifestyle\" (with Adam Levine), and 2022\\'s \"Slidin\\'\" (with Kodak Black).Born to Haitian parents in Miramar, Florida, Derulo started singing at an early age. He attended performing arts schools in Florida and took some early stabs at music composition, writing his first song at the age of eight. His writing skills began attracting attention, and by his teens, Derulo had begun composing tracks for artists like Lil Wayne, Pitbull, and Pleasure P. He also co-wrote \"Bossy\" for New Orleans-based rapper Birdman, and made a guest appearance on the song, highlighting his ability as a vocalist.After signing to Warner Bros. subsidiary Beluga Heights, Derulo began making the transition from behind-the-scenes songwriter to mainstream performer. His first hit arrived during the summer of 2009, when he wrapped a sample of Imogen Heap\\'s \"Hide and Seek\" (a song made popular by its appearance in the second season finale of The O.C., as well as the Saturday Night Live sketch \"Dear Sister\") around a sleek modern soul beat. Titled \"Whatcha Say,\" the song topped the Billboard Hot 100 and cracked the Top Ten in other territories, including Canada, Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K. A second single, \"In My Head,\" peaked at number five in the U.S., and Derulo\\'s full-length debut album arrived in early 2010. Future History followed in 2011, along with its hit single \"Don\\'t Wanna Go Home.\" At the start of 2012, he embarked on the Future History Tour, but broke one of his vertebrae during rehearsals. As a result of his neck injury, he canceled the entire tour. Recuperating and reflecting upon his injury, he announced details of his new album and released the single \"The Other Side\" in April 2013. Its follow-up, \"Talk Dirty\" featuring 2 Chainz, shot to number three on the pop chart during the summer of 2013, and the album Tattoos was released in September in most territories. The U.S. received a retooled version of the album in 2014 titled Talk Dirty. It featured several new tracks, including \"Wiggle\" with Snoop Dogg, which reached the Top Ten in the summer of 2014. With guest spots from Stevie Wonder, Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban, and others, Everything Is 4 followed in 2015. The album featured \"Want to Want Me\" -- Derulo\\'s sixth Top Ten pop hit -- and coincided with his new job as judge on the 12th season of So You Think You Can Dance. The following year, his biggest singles were compiled for Platinum Hits. Derulo returned in February 2017 with the song \"Swalla,\" which featured guest appearances from Nicki Minaj and Ty Dolla $ign. Reaching the Top 30 of the U.S. Billboard 200, the single was followed by \"Tip Toe\" with French Montana, \"Goodbye\" with David Guetta, Nicki Minaj, and Willy William, and \"Colors,\" which was chosen as the FIFA 2018 World Cup Anthem. Additional international collaborations followed with a multitude of cross-genre acts like pop singer Ava Max (\"Make Up\"), country duo Florida Georgia Line (\"Women\"), K-pop acts LAY and NCT 127 (\"Let\\'s Shut Up &amp; Dance\"), reggaeton artist Farruko (\"Mamacita\"), and Chinese singer Tia Ray (on the official 2019 FIBA Basketball theme \"Champion\"). Derulo closed 2019 with the first installment of his proposed 2Sides project, Side 1, which featured appearances by Stefflon Don and Ty Dolla $ign. He also starred as Rum Tum Tugger in the film adaptation of Cats.In 2020, Derulo parted ways with Warner Bros., which effectively canceled the 2Sides project.

After scoring their first hit with the multi-platinum international sensation \"Rather Be,\" featuring Jess Glynne (from 2014\\'s New Eyes), they issued a string of U.K. chart-toppers that proved successful around the world, including \"Rockabye\" with Sean Paul and Anne-Marie, \"Symphony\" with Zara Larsson, and \"Solo\" with Demi Lovato, all of which were included on 2018\\'s What Is Love? They again reached the U.K. Top Ten with 2020\\'s \"Tick Tock\" featuring 24kGoldn before releasing 2021\\'s \"Higher\" with Iann Dior. Founded in 2008 by schoolmates Grace Chatto (cello, percussion, and vocals), Jack Patterson (bass, keys, piano, and vocals), Luke Patterson (drums), and Neil Amin-Smith (violin and piano), they were originally dubbed the Chatto Quartet when they performed around their university. The classically trained string quartet performed J.S. Bach and cited Jacqueline du Pré as an influence, but their post-show, wind-down music often consisted of garage, 2-step, Craig David, and Arcade Fire tracks. The quartet members were aware of both producer Jon Wandeck and MC Ssegamic through the duo\\'s photographic work, and when Wandeck suggested they play on one of his house music cuts, Clean Bandit were born. With MC Ssegamic on the mike, they released the genre-mashing \"Telephone Banking\" in the summer of 2011. Their Dance Armstrong mixtape followed in 2012, while 2013 saw the release of the Mozart\\'s House EP. The \"Mozart House\" track also landed on their album New Eyes, which was released by major-label Atlantic in 2014. While early singles \"A+E\" and \"Dust Clears\" were modest chart successes in the U.K., it wasn\\'t until the release of New Eyes\\' fourth single -- the Jess Glynne-featuring \"Rather Be\" -- that Clean Bandit truly entered the international mainstream. The multi-platinum song became the second best-selling track in the U.K. in 2014 and won a Grammy for Best Dance Recording in 2015. The success of \"Rather Be\" helped the group ride New Eyes into 2016, yielding an additional pair of singles that kept Clean Bandit on the U.K. charts.In late 2016, Amin-Smith parted ways with the band, days before they released the single \"Rockabye,\" featuring Sean Paul and Anne-Marie on vocals. The track became their second U.K. number one and broke into the Billboard Top Ten, later receiving platinum certification throughout Europe and in the U.S. and Australia. Clean Bandit followed with another chart-topping collaboration, \"Symphony\" with Zara Larsson, and the Top Five single \"I Miss You\" with Julia Michaels. In 2018, the trio secured their fourth hit with the summer single \"Solo,\" featuring Demi Lovato. \"Baby\" with Marina and the Diamonds and Luis Fonsi arrived shortly before the release of the group\\'s sophomore full-length, What Is Love? In addition to the previously released hit singles, the album also included appearances by Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora, OutKast\\'s Big Boi, Craig David, and many more. A 2020 collaboration with rapper 24kGoldn yielded the Top Ten U.K. single \"Tick Tock.\" More tracks arrived in 2021, including \"Higher\" with Iann Dior and \"Drive\" with Topic and Wes Nelson. ~ David Jeffries &amp; Neil Z.

      "\"The Beatles recorded together for a little over seven years. Between October 1962 and May 1970, they released thirteen albums and a number of tracks issued on standalone singles. The catalogue created in that short period has sold more than that of any other group in history and its commercial success continues - the world's best selling album during the first decade of the 21st century was a collection of The Beatles' chart-topping singles called 1. But the group's significance stems not just from huge sales figures. Their music has inspired generation upon generation of musicians, songwriters and producers. As Mark Ronson put it: ‘Everything we take for granted - they absolutely invented it.' Tom Petty was a teenager during the years The Beatles' records appeared in quick succession: ‘They were just out in front. There was The Beatles …and then there was everyone else. And everyone else could be great, but The Beatles were leading the way and that's just irrefutably true.'The Beatles' story began in Liverpool in March 1957, when John Lennon (born 9 October 1940) formed a group named The Quarry Men. His life was changed by the excitement of rock 'n' roll music - heralded by Bill Haley and His Comets, but taken to another level when Elvis Presley stormed the charts during 1956. The next year saw the arrival in the UK of hits by Little Richard, Buddy Holly and The Crickets, the Everly Brothers and, in movie theatres, the exciting rock film The Girl Can't Help It!, featuring Eddie Cochran singing ‘Twenty Flight Rock'. Introduced to John on 6 July 1957 at a church fete in Woolton, Liverpool, Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) sang Eddie's song word perfect. Impressed, John invited the fifteen-year old to join his group. In February 1958, Paul's younger school pal George Harrison (born 25 February 1943) won his place in The Quarry Men when he impressed the others with his guitar skills, especially on the current hit instrumental ‘Raunchy' by Bill Justis. With a constant nucleus of John, Paul and George, the group underwent a series of line-up changes and names. Having gained a dependable drummer - Pete Best - in August 1960, The Beatles made their first visit to West Germany to perform in the clubs of Hamburg. Playing long sets through the night, they spent hundreds of hours onstage during five visits to the city. Back home in Liverpool, their regular stomping ground was The Cavern Club, where they played nearly 300 times. The experience gained in Hamburg and at The Cavern helped to make The Beatles the most proficient and popular group on Merseyside.At this time, a group from Liverpool had the odds stacked against them when trying to gain a foothold in a record business focused on London. In early 1962, they had acquired an ambitious and rather refined manager, record shop boss Brian Epstein. He faced regular rejection from music companies until George Martin signed the group to EMI's Parlophone label. By fate, The Beatles had found both the ideal manager and perfect producer. The last piece of the picture slotted into place just three weeks before recording their first single on 4 September 1962. Ringo Starr (born 7 July 1940) was asked to take over as drummer. He had been playing with Rory Storm &amp; The Hurricanes - another Liverpool group who played long stints in the clubs of Hamburg. Ringo's personality, sense of humour and rock solid, inventive drumming proved to be just right for The Beatles. Their first Parlophone single was released on 5 October 1962. Both sides of the disc were original compositions - a remarkable statement of intent from a group making their first steps in the music business. In fact, George Martin had urged them to record Mitch Murray's ‘How Do You Do It?', which he felt was a sure-fire hit. They had reluctantly agreed, but were able to persuade George to shelve the recording in favour of their own songs ‘Love Me Do' and ‘P.S. I Love You'. Just one example of how The Beatles' story might have been very different with a less open-minded record producer. George Martin's faith in The Beatles, and in John and Paul as songwriters, was soon vindicated by the release of ‘Please Please Me' in January 1963. The single reached the top of all but one of the UK charts. It was followed by the number one ‘From Me To You' and their first album Please Please Me, which topped the chart for 30 weeks until their next LP replaced it at number one. The debut album featured eight Lennon/McCartney compositions and six cover versions of recent American Rhythm and Blues records. The selection, a result of The Beatles' constant search for the unusual, showed their impeccable taste. Compared to the sophisticated arrangement of an R&amp;B original like ‘Twist And Shout', their versions were stripped down reinventions for a four-piece beat group. George Martin has confirmed that ‘it was primarily the American Rhythm and Blues sound that was their inspiration. It's probably what the so-called Beatles sound was, because all the black music was a tremendous influence on them.' However, that source was unknown to the majority of their British fans. The super-confident second album With The Beatles was issued in November 1963 when the single ‘She Loves You' was at number one. Once more, it featured eight original compositions - including ‘All My Loving' and George Harrison's first recorded song ‘Don't Bother Me' - and six cover versions. A week later, ‘I Want To Hold Your Hand' was released and also reached number one. The group had become the biggest musical phenomenon in British show business - ever. Among the key factors that led to this success were the chemistry between the four personalities in the group, their immense charm and a daring image - nobody had worn their hair that long. Their interviews were funny and articulate, they had a charismatic presence when performing, and girls screamed and swooned over them. The term ‘Beatlemania' was coined by the press to describe the hysteria aroused by the group but, as an appearance on The Royal Variety Show demonstrated, their popularity stretched way beyond the teenage market.What The Beatles did next was extraordinary for a British act. In February 1964, they arrived in the USA to appear on the Ed Sullivan Show. They performed to 73 million viewers, the biggest television audience to date, and with ‘I Want To Hold Your Hand' at the top of the charts, America was suddenly held spellbound by The Beatles. As their success spread across the world, almost everything the group did from then on was unprecedented. In addition to unparalleled success on record - they held all top five positions in the American chart in the first week of April - their first movie A Hard Day's Night was a box office hit and acclaimed for its wit, invention and unbeatable self-composed songs. Premiered in July 1964, it was perfectly timed to capitalise on their international breakthrough. They rounded off the year with Beatles For Sale and the massive hit single ‘I Feel Fine'. In 1965, they starred in the film Help!. Like their first movie, it was directed by Richard Lester and featured a brilliant batch of songs on its accompanying album. Tucked away towards the end of the LP was a performance by Paul McCartney of his composition ‘Yesterday'. Not even released as a single in the UK, it was a number one in America. It quickly became - and remains - the most covered song of all time. ‘Yesterday' is an example of how The Beatles and their producer did not compromise; whatever best served the song was always pursued. In the case of ‘Yesterday', the bold choice was a classical arrangement for string quartet. For the next album Rubber Soul, more studio time was made available to try out unusual instrumentation and adventurous recording techniques. The words of the songs were more mature and the vocal blend, heard on tracks such as ‘Nowhere Man' and ‘Michelle', is one of the album's most distinctive qualities. The Beatles' sound is, of course, distinguished by the character of their voices. Few groups were blessed with two powerful lead singers as versatile as John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Furthermore, George Harrison not only contributed at least one lead vocal to every album, his voice was integral to the intricate harmony vocals on many Beatles tracks. Ringo Starr usually sang a solo on albums, making such Lennon/McCartney songs as ‘Yellow Submarine' and ‘With A Little Help From My Friends' unimaginable without his voice.Released on the same day as Rubber Soul, 5 December 1965, ‘We Can Work It Out'/‘Day Tripper' was the first of The Beatles' double A-Sides. They ended another frantically busy year with their final British tour. There was a deadline to complete their next album, because concerts had been scheduled for the summer of 1966 all over the world. But this did not affect their approach to recording at all. The Revolver sessions saw the group reach a new peak of creativity in performance, songwriting and innovative studio techniques. In addition to the songwriting mastery displayed by John and Paul, the LP contained the biggest contribution to date from George with three songs. His caustic ‘Taxman' was given the status of the album's opening track. ‘Eleanor Rigby' is now regarded as a fully realised masterpiece, but when released in August 1966 on Revolver and as a single coupled with ‘Yellow Submarine', its solemn subject matter and stark arrangement were radically different. A year before, in August 1965, their appearance in front of 55,600 fans at Shea Stadium in New York had broken the record for concert attendance and box-office revenue. But live performance had become an unsatisfying charade ...and dangerous too. Who cares how lucrative it was? That had to stop. The Beatles' final concert for a paying audience took place at Candlestick Park, San Francisco on 29 August 1966.At the end of 1966, The Beatles started work on ‘Strawberry Fields Forever'. Its long evolution showed the musical imagination and technical experimentation heard on Revolver would be continued. To stop the long wait for new material, ‘Strawberry Fields Forever' and ‘Penny Lane' were released in February 1967. Although songs were always credited to Lennon and McCartney, it soon became clear that whoever sang the lead vocal was usually the main composer. The double A-sided single shows how their different stylistic approaches established a perfect counterbalance. Having set themselves a task of writing about their Liverpool childhoods, John's song is dreamy and steeped in melancholy, while Paul's is uplifting and brimming with brilliantly observed vignettes. Many were shocked when the unconventional promotional films for both songs were broadcast. Even their moustaches and John's spectacles were considered to be evidence of how weird The Beatles had become. The square world worried. Everyone else listened over and over until they ‘got it'. Released on 1 June 1967, the immediate artistic and commercial success of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band vindicated the new approach taken by The Beatles. It was the album that provided the soundtrack to the so-called ‘summer of love', but its appeal is ageless. The Beatles performed their next single ‘All You Need Is Love' for the first time on the TV programme Our World - broadcast live to an audience of 350 million around the globe. Their place at the top of contemporary pop music was indisputable. Sadly, soon afterwards, The Beatles were shaken by the sudden death of their manager Brian Epstein in August 1967. They rallied to write and direct Magical Mystery Tour - a film shown on television in the UK at Christmas. Some of the millions who saw it, did not like it. As Paul McCartney remembered: ‘They were looking for the plum-pudding special. That's what they were expecting, and they very much didn't get it! We were giving it to the young kids. Why shouldn't they see something far out?' The music was as successful as ever. The six new songs in the film and the number one ‘Hello, Goodbye' completed a momentous year of recording. Three more tracks from 1967 remained unreleased until they were heard in the movie Yellow Submarine premiered in 1968. The film's imaginative animation evoked the ‘psychedelic' spirit of Sgt. Pepper to reveal the triumph of Love over Evil.Nowadays, following a year as busy as The Beatles had in 1967, an artist would take an extended break. In fact, the group did allow themselves a little time off. The first music of 1968 came in March on their seventeenth single ‘Lady Madonna'. Soon after it was recorded, The Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. At this remote and peaceful location, they enjoyed a prolific period of songwriting. As George Harrison explained: ‘When we came back, it became apparent that there were more songs than would make up a single album.' Recorded in five months, the double LP The Beatles was soon known as ‘The White Album' because of its plain white cover. ‘Hey Jude' and ‘Revolution' were the first songs to be heard from the sessions when they were released as a single on 30 August 1968 - the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label. Never interested in repeating themselves, The Beatles took a different approach in the studio in 1968. Ringo Starr remembered: ‘On “The White Album” we ended up being a band again and that's what I always love. I love being in a band.' Discussing his songwriting, John Lennon reflected: ‘It was a complete reversal from Sgt. Pepper. My songs on the double album were fairly simple and basic.' It is still astonishing to hear The Beatles moving through every style of popular music imaginable, including a pastiche of a Hollywood musical number (‘Honey Pie'), an intense blues (‘Yer Blues') and heavy rock (‘Helter Skelter'). As with Sgt. Pepper, no singles were released from ‘The White Album' in the UK and USA during the 1960s. But it is full of tracks that could have been huge hits, such as ‘Back In The USSR', ‘Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da' and ‘While My Guitar Gently Weeps'.In January 1969, while ‘The White Album' was still at number one, The Beatles assembled to write and rehearse brand new songs for a televised live concert. The plan changed so that, in the end, their work was documented in a movie released over a year later. Its final scene showed The Beatles performing on the roof of their Apple office building in Savile Row, London with most of the audience gathered in the street below. ‘Get Back', a number one single from the sessions at Apple, was swiftly followed by ‘The Ballad Of John And Yoko' - a chronicle of John's marriage to Yoko Ono and their honeymoon/‘Bed-In' for peace in Amsterdam. Recorded mostly during the summer of 1969, the last album The Beatles made together was named after the street where EMI's studios are located. It was a fitting tribute to the place where the majority of their songs had been recorded. The Beatles' collaboration with producer George Martin and the engineers at Abbey Road had challenged the way that popular music was created. On many occasions this team re-wrote the rule book and set a new standard to which their contemporaries had to aspire. In contrast to the January recordings at Apple, which were ‘as live' with no overdubs, their return to Abbey Road studios with George Martin resulted in carefully crafted tracks with ambitious musical arrangements. The album's varied highlights include ‘Come Together' and two songs that showed George Harrison's songwriting had hit a peak - ‘Something' and ‘Here Comes The Sun'. However, the character of Abbey Road is dominated by the sophisticated medley the group called ‘The Long One'. It brought the album, and The Beatles' recording career, to an impressive conclusion. What a farewell. Measured in terms of its enormous popularity and musical ingenuity, Abbey Road now challenges the status of Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' greatest achievement. When the earlier set of recordings from 1969 was finally released as Let It Be in May 1970, news had already broken that the group had split up. The album's title track and ‘The Long And Winding Road' took the total of American number ones by The Beatles to twenty in six years - a feat unequalled by any other artist.When The Beatles began making records, no one anticipated that they would be listened to far into the future. Pop music was regarded as disposable. But the timeless appeal of The Beatles' catalogue ensured it was built to last and highly valued. In 1979, the distinguished conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein wrote: ‘Three bars of “A Day In The Life” still sustain me, rejuvenate me, inflame my senses and sensibilities.' There is also another dimension to the seductive power of The Beatles' music. Filled with the spirit of the era in which it was born, it is joyous and generous. ‘All You Need Is Love'. ‘With our love - we could save the world.' ‘The love you take is equal to the love you make.' Tom Petty felt it: ‘We grew up with The Beatles and grew up trusting them. They could have chosen to do anything and they chose to do good, which is a great example for the rest of us.'Kevin Howlett\"\n",

      "'Elvis Presley belongs on the short list of artists who changed the course of popular music in the 20th century. He may not have invented rock &amp; roll, but he was indisputably its first rock star, a singer whose charisma was tightly intertwined with his natural talent for a combination that seemed combustible, sexy, and dangerous when Presley seized the imagination of America with four successive number one singles in 1956. Presley spent the next two decades near the top of the charts, weathering changes in fashion, self-inflicted missteps, and comebacks as his music expanded and evolved. Throughout his career, he never abandoned the rock &amp; roll he pioneered on his early singles for Sun Records, but he developed an effective counterpoint to his primal rockabilly by honing a rich, resonant ballad style while also delving into blues, country, and soul, progressions that came into sharp relief with his celebrated \"comeback\" in the late 1960s. Some musical nuances were overshadowed by Presley\\'s phenomenal celebrity, a fame maintained by a long string of B-movies in the \\'60s and extravagant Las Vegas shows in the \\'70s, elements that were essential in creating a stardom that persisted long after his premature death in 1977. The myth of Elvis grew in his absence, aided by an estate intent on keeping Presley in the public view: his recordings were continually reissued, his Memphis home Graceland became a tourist attraction, and Baz Luhrmann\\'s 2022 biopic Elvis introduced Presley to a new audience. The passage of time helped clarify the depth and range of his musical achievements. He undeniably kick-started the rock &amp; roll era, shaping the sound and attitudes of the last few decades of the 20th century in the process, but he also built a distinctive body of work that reflected the best of what American music has to offer. Born to a poor Mississippi family in the heart of the Depression, Presley had moved to Memphis by his teens, where he absorbed the vibrant melting pot of Black Southern music in the form of blues, country, bluegrass, and gospel. After graduating from high school, he became a truck driver, rarely, if ever, singing in public. Some 1953 and 1954 demos, recorded at the emerging Sun label in Memphis primarily for Presley\\' own pleasure, helped stir interest on the part of Sun owner Sam Phillips. In the middle of 1954, Phillips, looking for a white singer with a Black feel, teamed Presley with guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black. Almost by accident, apparently, the trio hit upon a version of an Arthur Crudup blues tune \"That\\'s All Right Mama,\" which became Presley\\'s first single. Presley\\'s five Sun singles pioneered the blend of R&amp;B and C&amp;W that would characterize rockabilly music. Claiming that Presley made blues acceptable for the white market is not the whole picture; the singles usually combined blues covers with country and pop ones, all made into rock &amp; roll (at this point, a term that barely existed) with the pulsing beat, slap-back echo, and Presley\\'s soaring, frenetic vocals. \"That\\'s All Right Mama,\" \"Blue Moon of Kentucky,\" \"Good Rockin\\' Tonight,\" \"Baby Let\\'s Play House,\" and \"Mystery Train\" remain core early rock classics. The singles immediately sold well in the Memphis area, and by 1955 were starting to sell well to country audiences throughout the South. Presley, Moore, and Black hit the road with a stage show that grew ever wilder and more provocative, with Presley\\'s swiveling hips causing enormous controversy. The move to all-out rock was hastened by the addition of drums. The last Sun single, \"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\"/\"Mystery Train,\" hit number one on the national country charts in late 1955. Presley was obviously a performer with superstar potential, attracting the interest of both bigger labels and Colonel Tom Parker, who became Presley\\'s manager. In need of capital to expand the Sun label, Sam Phillips sold Presley\\'s contract to RCA in late 1955 for $35,000.00; a bargain when viewed in hindsight, but an astronomical sum at the time. This is the point where musical historians start to diverge in opinion. For many, the whole of his subsequent work for RCA -- encompassing over 20 years -- never recaptured the pure, primal energy that was harnessed so effectively on the handful of Sun singles. Presley, however, was not a purist. What he wanted, more than anything, was to be successful. To do that, his material needed more of a pop feel; in any case, he\\'d never exactly been one to disparage the mainstream, naming Dean Martin as one of his chief heroes from the get-go. At RCA, his rockabilly was leavened with enough pop flavor to make all of the charts, not just the country ones. At the beginning, at least, the results were hardly any tamer than the Sun sessions. \"Heartbreak Hotel,\" his first single, rose to number one and, aided by some national television appearances, helped make him an instant superstar. \"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\" was a number one follow-up; the double-sided monster \"Hound Dog\"/\"Don\\'t Be Cruel\" was one of the biggest-selling singles the industry had ever experienced up to that point. His first two LPs, Elvis Presley and Elvis, were also chart-toppers, not just in the U.S., but throughout the world. The 1956 RCA recordings, while a bit more sophisticated in production and a bit less rootsy in orientation than his previous work, were still often magnificent, rating among the best and most influential recordings of early rock &amp; roll. Presley\\'s (and Parker\\'s) aspirations were too big to be limited to records and live appearances. By late 1956, his first Hollywood movie, Love Me Tender, had been released; other screen vehicles would follow in the next few years, Jailhouse Rock being the best. The hits continued unabated, several of them (\"Jailhouse Rock,\" \"All Shook Up,\" \"Too Much\") excellent, and often benefiting from the efforts of top early rock songwriter Otis Blackwell, as well as the emerging team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The Jordanaires added both pop and gospel elements with their smooth backup vocals. The Dean Martin influence began rearing its head in smoky, sentimental ballads such as \"Loving You\"; the vocal swoops became more exaggerated and stereotypical, although the overall quality of his output remained high. And although Moore and Black continued to back Elvis on his early RCA recordings, within a few years the musicians had gone their own ways.Presley\\'s recording and movie careers were interrupted by his induction into the Army in early 1958. There was enough material in the can to flood the charts throughout his two-year absence (during which he largely served in Germany). When he reentered civilian life in 1960, his level of popularity, remarkably, was just as high as when he left. However, Presley\\'s rebellious, wild image had been tamed to a large degree, as he and Parker began designing a career built around Hollywood films. Shortly after leaving the Army, in fact, Presley gave up live performance altogether for nearly a decade to concentrate on movie-making. The films, in turn, would serve as vehicles to both promote his records and to generate maximum revenue with minimal effort. For much of the \\'60s, Presley ground out two or three movies a year that were mostly profitable. This also meant that his \\'60s discography was soon dominated by soundtracks that were sometimes filled out with outtakes that had sitting around for years. There were some good singles in the early \\'60s, like \"Return to Sender\"; once in a while there was even a flash of superb, tough rock, like \"Little Sister\" or \"(Marie\\'s the Name) His Latest Flame.\" By 1967 and 1968, there were slight stirrings of an artistic reawakening in Presley through singles like \"Guitar Man,\" \"Big Boss Man,\" and \"U.S. Male.\" A 1968 television special gave him the opportunity he needed to reinvent himself as an all-out leather-coated rocker, still capable of magnetizing an audience and eager to revisit his blues and country roots.The 1968 album From Elvis in Memphis found Presley updating his sounds with contemporary compositions and touches of soul to create some reasonably gutsy late-\\'60s pop/rock. This material, and 1969 hits like \"Suspicious Minds\" and \"In the Ghetto,\" returned him to the top of the charts. Presley returned to live performance in 1969, breaking in with weeks of shows in Las Vegas. This was followed by national tours that proved him still capable of being an excellent live entertainer. (Presley never did play outside of North America and Hawaii, possibly because Parker, it was later revealed, was an illegal alien who could have faced serious problems if he traveled abroad.) Hollywood was history, but studio and live albums were generated at a rapid pace, usually selling reasonably well, although Presley never had a Top Ten hit after 1972\\'s \"Burning Love.\" Presley\\'s \\'70s recordings, were pretty eclectic, running from country to blues to all-out rock to gospel (Presley periodically recorded gospel-only releases, going all the way back to 1957). During Presley\\'s final years, his behavior became increasingly unstable. His weight fluctuated wildly; his marriage broke up; he became dependent upon a variety of prescription drugs. He became isolated from the outside world except for professional purposes (he continued to tour until the end), rarely venturing outside of his Graceland mansion in Memphis. He even stopped leaving his home for recording sessions, using an RCA Records mobile recording truck to make up the bulk of his final two albums, 1976\\'s From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee and 1977\\'s Moody Blue, At Graceland. (A collection of these final home recordings appeared in 2016, titled Way Down in the Jungle Room.) Colonel Parker\\'s financial decisions on behalf of his client have also come under much scrutiny. On August 16, 1977, Presley was found dead in Graceland. The cause of death remains a subject of widespread speculation, although it seems likely that drugs played a part. An immediate cult sprang up around his legacy, kept alive by the hundreds of thousands of visitors who make the pilgrimage to Graceland annually. Elvis memorabilia, much of it kitsch, is another industry in its own right. Thousands of singers make a comfortable living by impersonating the King in live performances. In the digital age, RCA finally began to treat the catalog with some of the reverence it deserved, at long last assembling a box set containing nearly all of the \\'50s recordings. This 1992 set, called The King of Rock \\'n\\' Roll, was the first of many serious compilations that focused on particular decades, phases, and collaborators. These archival sets, targeted at collectors, were balanced with LPs like Follow That Dream, which aimed for a mainstream audience. The most popular of these was the 2002 compilation Elv1s: 30 #1 Hits, which topped the charts in the U.S. and U.K. on its way to multi-platinum certification, but a pair of albums that grafted original Presley performances to music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra -- 2015\\'s If I Can Dream and 2016\\'s The Wonder of You -- went to number one in the U.K. in the mid-2010s; Christmas with Elvis, a seasonal set overdubbed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, debuted at six in the U.K. upon its 2017 release. In 2018, the two-part documentary Elvis Presley: The Searcher premiered on HBO and was accompanied by two soundtracks, one a single disc and one a box set. Later that year, an overdubbed collection of gospel material was released under the title Where No One Stands Alone, as was a box set celebrating the 50th anniversary of his \\'68 Comeback. In 2019, the 50th anniversary of Presley\\'s return to live performance was celebrated with the release of Live 1969, a box set containing 11 full concerts from his first engagement at the International Hotel in Las Vegas. A new generation was introduced to Presley\\'s music and life in 2022 with the release of the award-winning Baz Luhrmann biopic Elvis, starring Austin Butler in the title role; he was nominated for an Oscar for his performance. The accompanying soundtrack topped charts in the U.K. and U.S.Sony continued to release archival projects in the wake of the success of Luhrmann\\'s Elvis movie, including two box sets in 2023: the six-disc set Elvis on Tour, which documented his 1972 North American tour, and a 50th anniversary edition of Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; Richie Unterberger, Rovi'\n",

      "'While most bands undergo a number of changes over the course of their careers, few of them experienced more radical stylistic evolution than Fleetwood Mac. Initially conceived as a hard-edged British blues combo in the late \\'60s, the band gradually evolved into a polished pop/rock act over the course of a decade. Throughout all of their incarnations, the only consistent members of Fleetwood Mac were drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie -- the rhythm section that provided the band with their name. Ironically, they had the least influence over the musical direction of the band. Originally, guitarists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer provided the group with their gutsy, neo-psychedelic blues-rock sound, but as both guitarists descended into mental illness, the band began moving toward pop/rock with the songwriting of pianist Christine McVie. By the mid-\\'70s, Fleetwood Mac had relocated to California, where they added the soft rock duo of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to their lineup. Obsessed with the meticulously arranged pop of the Beach Boys and the Beatles, Buckingham helped the band become one of the most popular groups of the late \\'70s. Combining soft rock with the confessional introspection of singer/songwriters, Fleetwood Mac created a slick but emotional sound that helped 1977\\'s Rumours become one of the biggest-selling albums of all time. The band retained their popularity through the early \\'80s, when Buckingham, Nicks, and Christine McVie all began pursuing solo careers. The group reunited for 1987\\'s Tango in the Night, but Buckingham left the band and Fleetwood Mac entered a period where they slowly lost their frontmen, culminating in the group officially calling it a day after Time faded upon its 1995 release. The band quickly reunited, though, assembling for The Dance, a 1997 live album, then stabilizing without Christine McVie for their 2000s incarnation, a lineup that produced 2003\\'s Say You Will. McVie returned to the fold for a series of successful tours starting in 2014, but the group harmony was short-lived. Buckingham was ousted prior to an anniversary tour in 2018, his departure proof that the one constant in Fleetwood Mac through the years was change.The roots of Fleetwood Mac lie in John Mayall\\'s legendary British blues outfit, the Bluesbreakers. Bassist John McVie was one of the charter members of the Bluesbreakers, joining the group in 1963. In 1966 Peter Green replaced Eric Clapton, and a year later drummer Mick Fleetwood joined. Inspired by the success of Cream, the Yardbirds, and Jimi Hendrix, the trio decided to break away from Mayall in 1967. At their debut at the British Jazz and Blues Festival in August, Bob Brunning was playing bass in the group, since McVie was still under contract to Mayall. He joined the band a few weeks after their debut; by that time, slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer had joined the band. Fleetwood Mac soon signed with Blue Horizon, releasing their eponymous debut the following year. Fleetwood Mac was an enormous hit in the U.K., spending over a year in the Top Ten. Despite its British success, the album was virtually ignored in America. During 1968, the band added guitarist Danny Kirwan. The following year, they recorded Fleetwood Mac in Chicago with a variety of bluesmen, including Willie Dixon and Otis Spann. The set was released later that year, after the band had left Blue Horizon for a one-album deal with Immediate Records; in the U.S., they signed with Reprise/Warner Bros., and by 1970, Warner began releasing the band\\'s British records as well.Fleetwood Mac released English Rose and Then Play On during 1969, which both indicated that the band was expanding its music, moving away from its blues purist roots. That year, Peter Green\\'s \"Man of the World\" and \"Oh Well\" were number two hits. Though his music was providing the backbone of the group, Green was growing increasingly disturbed due to his large ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs. After announcing that he was planning to give all of his earnings away, Green suddenly left the band in the spring of 1970; he released two solo albums over the course of the \\'70s, but he rarely performed after leaving Fleetwood Mac. The band replaced him with Christine Perfect, a vocalist/pianist who had earned a small but loyal following in the U.K. by singing with Spencer Davis and the Chicken Shack. She had already performed uncredited on Then Play On. Contractual difficulties prevented her from becoming a full-fledged member of Fleetwood Mac until 1971; by that time she had married John McVie.Christine McVie didn\\'t appear on 1970\\'s Kiln House, the first album the band recorded without Peter Green. For that album, Jeremy Spencer dominated the band\\'s musical direction, but he had also been undergoing mental problems due to heavy drug use. During the band\\'s American tour in early 1971, Spencer disappeared; it was later discovered that he left the band to join the religious cult the Children of God. Fleetwood Mac had already been trying to determine the direction of their music, but Spencer\\'s departure sent the band into disarray. Christine McVie and Danny Kirwan began to move the band toward mainstream rock on 1971\\'s Future Games, but new guitarist Bob Welch exerted a heavy influence on 1972\\'s Bare Trees. Kirwan was fired after Bare Trees and was replaced by guitarists Bob Weston and Dave Walker, who appeared on 1973\\'s Penguin. Walker left after that album, and Weston departed after making its follow-up, Mystery to Me (1973). In 1974, the group\\'s manager, Clifford Davis, formed a bogus Fleetwood Mac and had the band tour the U.S. The real Fleetwood Mac filed and won a lawsuit against the imposters who, after losing, began performing under the name Stretch -- but the lawsuit kept the band off the road for most of the year. In the interim, they released Heroes Are Hard to Find. Late in 1974, Fleetwood Mac moved to California, with hopes of restarting their career. Welch left the band shortly after the move to form Paris.Early in 1975, Fleetwood and McVie were auditioning engineers for the band\\'s new album when they heard Buckingham-Nicks, an album recorded by the soft rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The pair were asked to join the group and their addition revived the band\\'s musical and commercial fortunes. Not only did Buckingham and Nicks write songs, but they brought distinctive talents the band had been lacking. Buckingham was a skilled pop craftsman, capable of arranging a commercial song while keeping it musically adventurous. Nicks had a husky voice and a sexy, hippie gypsy stage persona that gave the band a charismatic frontwoman. The new lineup of Fleetwood Mac released their eponymous debut in 1975 and it slowly became a huge hit, reaching number one in 1976 on the strength of the singles \"Over My Head,\" \"Rhiannon,\" and \"Say You Love Me.\" The album would eventually sell over five million copies in the U.S. alone.While Fleetwood Mac had finally attained their long-desired commercial success, the band was fraying behind the scenes. The McVies divorced in 1976, and Buckingham and Nicks\\' romance ended shortly afterward. The internal tensions formed the basis for the songs on their next album, Rumours. Released in the spring of 1977, Rumours became a blockbuster success, topping the American and British charts and generating the Top Ten singles \"Go Your Own Way,\" \"Dreams,\" \"Don\\'t Stop,\" and \"You Make Loving Fun.\" It would eventually sell over 17 million copies in the U.S. alone, making it the second biggest-selling album of all time. Fleetwood Mac supported the album with an exhaustive, lucrative tour and then retired to the studio to record their follow-up to Rumours. A wildly experimental double album conceived largely by Buckingham, 1979\\'s Tusk didn\\'t duplicate the enormous success of Rumours, yet it did go multi-platinum and featured the Top Ten singles \"Sara\" and \"Tusk.\" In 1980, they released the double album Live.Following the Tusk tour, Fleetwood, Buckingham, and Nicks all recorded solo albums. Of the solo projects, Stevie Nicks\\' Bella Donna (1981) was the most successful, peaking at number one and featuring the hit singles \"Stop Draggin\\' My Heart Around,\" \"Leather and Lace,\" and \"Edge of Seventeen.\" Buckingham\\'s Law and Order (1981) was a moderate success, spawning the Top Ten \"Trouble.\" Fleetwood, for his part, made a world music album called The Visitor. Fleetwood Mac reconvened in 1982 for Mirage. More conventional and accessible than Tusk, Mirage reached number one and featured the hit singles \"Hold Me\" and \"Gypsy.\"After Mirage, Buckingham, Nicks, and Christine McVie all worked on solo albums. The hiatus was due to a variety of reasons. Each member had his or her own manager, Nicks was becoming the group\\'s breakaway star, Buckingham was obsessive in the studio, and each member was suffering from various substance addictions. Nicks was able to maintain her popularity, with The Wild Heart (1983) and Rock a Little (1985) both reaching the Top 15. Christine McVie also had a Top Ten hit with \"Got a Hold on Me\" in 1984. Buckingham received the strongest reviews of all, but his 1984 album Go Insane failed to generate a hit. Fleetwood Mac reunited to record a new album in 1985. Buckingham, who had grown increasingly frustrated with the musical limitations of the band, decided to make it his last Fleetwood Mac project. When the resulting album, Tango in the Night, was finally released in 1987, it was greeted with mixed reviews but strong sales, reaching the Top Ten and generating the Top 20 hits \"Little Lies,\" \"Seven Wonders,\" and \"Everywhere.\"Buckingham decided to leave Fleetwood Mac after completing Tango in the Night, and the group replaced him with guitarists Billy Burnette and Rick Vito. The new lineup of the band recorded their first album, Behind the Mask, in 1990. It became the band\\'s first album since 1975 to not go gold. Following its supporting tour, Nicks and Christine McVie announced they would continue to record with the group, but not tour. Vito left the band in 1991, and the group released the box set 25 Years -- The Chain the following year. The classic Fleetwood Mac lineup of Fleetwood, the McVies, Buckingham, and Nicks reunited to play President Bill Clinton\\'s inauguration in early 1993, but the concert did not lead to a full-fledged reunion. Later that year, Nicks left the band and was replaced by Bekka Bramlett and Dave Mason; Christine McVie left the group shortly afterward. The new lineup of Fleetwood Mac began touring in 1994, releasing Time the following year to little attention. While the new version of Fleetwood Mac wasn\\'t commercially successful, neither were the solo careers of Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie, prompting speculation of a full-fledged reunion in 1997. Soon these whispers proved to be true, as the classic Rumours quintet reunited for a live performance that became the 1997 album The Dance. The album performed well, debuting at number one on Billboard and generating an adult contemporary hit in the new version of \"Landslide.\" Fleetwood Mac supported The Dance with a tour that lasted throughout the year and, early in 1998, the band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Not long afterward, Christine McVie announced she was leaving the band.Her departure may have slowed the speed of Fleetwood Mac\\'s reunion, but the remaining quartet set to work writing and recording a new album. The resulting Say You Will appeared in April of 2003; it was their first studio album in eight years and the first in 16 to feature Buckingham and Nicks. Say You Will performed well -- it went gold in the U.S., U.K., and Canada, with the singles \"Peacekeeper\" and \"Say You Will\" reaching the U.S. Adult Contemporary Top 20 -- and the accompanying international tour was a success. After a few quiet years where Buckingham resumed his solo career and the group unsuccessfully courted Sheryl Crow as a replacement for Christine McVie, they reconvened for a tour in 2009. Four years later, the group celebrated the 35th anniversary of Rumours with a new deluxe box reissue accompanied by a tour. As the tour got underway in April, the band unexpectedly released a four-track Extended Play of new material; it received good notices and entered the U.S. charts at 48.During a three-night stint at London\\'s O2 in September 2013, Christine McVie appeared with Fleetwood Mac for the first time in 15 years. In January 2014, the band announced that Christine was rejoining the group and they started recording a new album. The progress on the album was slow and steady, partially due to individual solo projects, partially due to interruptions caused by the band\\'s ongoing world tour; they played international dates in both 2014 and 2015. As the group continued to chip away at their new record, they released a Super Deluxe reissue of Tusk in time for the holidays of 2015, which was followed the subsequent fall by a Deluxe reissue of Mirage. Further catalog reissues followed in the next few years -- Tango in the Night received a Super Deluxe treatment in 2017, while their eponymous 1975 album got an upgrade in early 2018 -- but the bigger news in Fleetwood Mac circles was Buckingham and McVie recording a duet album together in 2017. Initially planned as a new Fleetwood Mac album, the 2017 set -- entitled Buckingham McVie, echoing 1973\\'s Buckingham Nicks -- turned into a Lindsey and Christine project once Stevie Nicks decided to concentrate on her solo career. Retaining Mick Fleetwood and John McVie as their main rhythm section, Buckingham and McVie finished the album with the assistance of producers Mitchell Froom and Mark Needham, releasing the record in June 2017. Early in 2018, Fleetwood Mac reunited to play a gig celebrating their award as MusiCares Person of the Year. This turned out to be the last concert Buckingham would play with Fleetwood Mac. In April, Buckingham was fired from the band; he would later file a lawsuit against the group regarding his dismissal. Fleetwood Mac hired Neil Finn and Mike Campbell to replace him and launched an international tour in September 2018, releasing a compilation album titled 50 Years: Don\\'t Stop as a companion to the tour. The record debuted at 12 on the U.K. charts and 65 on Billboard\\'s Top 200. The concert album Before the Beginning: Rare Live &amp; Demo Sessions 1968-1970 arrived in November 2019 and featured previously unreleased live performances captured during Peter Green\\'s time with the band. This reminder of Green\\'s glory days came only months before he died in his sleep on July 25, 2020, at the age of 73. Two months after Green\\'s passing, the box set Fleetwood Mac: 1969-1974 appeared; it had expanded and remastered versions of all the albums the group released during those six years. Christine McVie died on November 30, 2022 after a brief illness; she was 79 years of age. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Since Roja hit movie screens in South India in 1992, A.R. Rahman has redefined the country\\'s widely popular film music. Generally regarded as the finest Indian film composer of his time (and certainly the most commercially successful), Rahman produced music for dozens of widescreen releases just during his first five years in the industry. He has worked with many of his country\\'s brightest music stars and a growing list of international luminaries, including Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Zakir Hussain, L. Shankar, Apache Indian, and David Byrne.Born A.S. Dileep Kumar on October 10th, 1966, in Madras, India, Allah Rakha Rahman was exposed to music from the time he was a child, entered in classical piano studies by his parents at the age of four. At 16, he quit school and was following in his father\\'s footsteps (R.K. Shekhar was a successful film musician, arranger, and conductor himself), working full-time as a session musician on soundtracks under the popular South Indian composer Ilaiyaraaja. The monotony soon grew tiring however, and at the suggestion of a colleague, Rahman tried his hand at television commercials, eventually composing over 300 jingles in just five years. It wasn\\'t until 1989 that Rahman planted the first seeds of his film career. That year, he began acquiring the equipment and organizing the sound library for his Panchathan Record Inn. When Sharada Trilok\\'s ad for Leo Coffee (for which Rahman penned the music) won her an award, she introduced the young composer to her cousin, Mani Ratnam. Impressed with his work, the director signed Rahman to compose the music for K. Balachander\\'s 1992 film Roja. Rahman\\'s score, a colorful, uncluttered combination of pop, rock, reggae, and his country\\'s traditional music, reshaped the genre, winning him three awards for Best Music Director. Roja became the equivalent of an Indian crossover success. Originally filmed in South Indian Tamil, it was re-dubbed (and its soundtrack re-recorded) in Hindi, the language of North India\\'s famous Bollywood film center. His star on the rise, Rahman proceeded to compose music for six films in 1993 and nine in 1994, including the score for Ratnam\\'s Bombay (1995), the story of a Hindu/Muslim marriage in a time of heated relations between the two cultures. Rahman\\'s score displayed a characteristic (and appropriate) disregard for the confines of culture, be they Eastern or Western, once again mixing traditional and modern elements. Bombay was hugely successful and the movie\\'s theme was featured on Talvin Singh\\'s Soundz of the Asian Underground compilation. Rahman became the first Indian artist to sign with Sony Music, negotiating a three-year contract in 1997. His premier release for the label, Vande Mataram (his first collection of non-film music), was a tribute to India, commemorating 50 years of the country\\'s independence. The album reached record stores in 28 countries on August 15 of that year. Rahman finally seemed poised on the brink of the international success he desired. Performances were booked in Europe, Canada, and the United States during the final years of the century and a session was arranged with singer David Byrne (owner of the Luaka Bop label and a Rahman fan). Andrew Lloyd Webber chose Rahman to compose the music for his Bombay Dreams, a musical based on the Bollywood film industry. The pair began work on the project during the second half of 2000, and the musical opened in London during 2002. Bombay Dreams also ran for 284 regular performances at the Broadway Theatre in New York from April 2004 to January 2005.After the turn of the millennium, Rahman only saw his global recognition and acclaim grow, as he rose to the upper echelon of film composers worldwide. In 2005 he opened AM Studios -- regarded as one of the foremost recording facilities in Asia -- as an adjunct to Panchathan Record Inn, and the following year the composer established his own record label, KM Music. Rahman served as musical director for nearly 50 films from 2001 through 2008, the majority being Hindi- or Tamil-language movies, including noteworthy collaborations with Roja and Bombay director Mani Ratnam (Kannathil Muthamittal, Ayutha Ezhuthu/Yuva, Guru). During that time, he also worked with Rajiv Menon (Kandukondain Kandukondain), Shaad Ali (Saathiya), Ashutosh Gowariker (Swades), and S. Shankar (Boys, Sivaji), the latter of whom, like Ratnam, also directed a number of films scored by Rahman during the \\'90s. He scored the 2003 Chinese (Mandarin-language) film Warriors of Heaven and Earth directed by He Ping and co-composed (with Craig Armstrong) the score to the 2007 English-language film Elizabeth: The Golden Age, directed by Shekhar Kapur and starring Cate Blanchett. However, Rahman\\'s widest recognition to that point -- at least with Western audiences -- came with British director Danny Boyle\\'s 2008 hit film Slumdog Millionaire. It won eight Academy Awards in the United States, including Best Picture and Best Director as well as two for Rahman: Best Original Score and Best Song. Two Rahman songs from the film had been nominated for Oscars, \"O... Saya\" and \"Jai Ho,\" the latter of which won the statuette for Rahman and for lyricist Gulzar. In 2010, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, India\\'s third highest civilian award. The following year, he was nominated for two more Oscars, this time for best song and score for 2010\\'s 127 Hours, also directed by Boyle. As he continued to write music for Indian cinema at a prolific rate, subsequent work in Hollywood included the 2014 Disney co-production Million Dollar Arm and 2016\\'s Pelé: Birth of a Legend. A year later, his music could be heard in the U.K.-India co-production Viceroy\\'s House, directed by Gurinder Chadha. ~ Nathan Bush, Rovi'\n",

      "'Pink Floyd are one of the most successful and influential rock groups in history.The members of the group to become known as Pink Floyd came together in London, but the band\\'s roots were in Cambridge, in the East of England, in the early 1960s.Roger ‘Syd\\' Barrett, Roger Waters and David Gilmour all grew up in Cambridge, (Roger Waters having moved there from Surrey at the age of 2), and got into music as part of the folk and beat boom of the time. Young Roger Barrett was actively encouraged in his music and art by his parents, and was successful at both while in school.He knew Roger Waters from school and met David Gilmour as a teenager, so their friendships were established long before the formation of Pink Floyd. Roger Barrett acquired the nickname \\'Syd\\' around the ageof 14, in a reference to local bass player Sid Barrett, hence the ‘Syd\\' spelling for differentiation.The Barrett family home had hosted musical collaborations from 1962 onwards, the first fruits of which became Geoff Mott and the Mottoes, including Syd on rhythm guitar. In September 1962, Roger Waters left Cambridge for London to study architecture. Syd meanwhile had won a 2-year scholarship to Cambridge School of Art, where he re-established contact with David Gilmour, swapping guitar chords at lunchtime sessions.London\\'s Regent Street Polytechnic had by now welcomed not only Roger Waters but Richard Wright, a Londoner, and Nick Mason, who was born in Birmingham but relocated to Hampstead at age 2. Roger and Nick responded to a college advert recruiting band members, and duly formed Sigma 6, playing guitar and drums respectively. Richard Wright also joined, playing guitar, various brass instruments and keyboards, depending on whether a piano was available.As well as Polytechnic studies, Richard was taking private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric Gilder School of Music, and in fact left architectural studies (and the band, now called The Abdabs) at the end of his first year, to go travelling.In Autumn 1964 Syd Barrett moved to London to attend Camberwell Art College, hooking up with Roger Waters and the Abdabs. Two of the band had just left, which left space for two guitarists: Syd, and fellow Cambridge friend Rado (‘Bob\\') Klose, Roger Waters having switched to bass guitar. Originally Leonard\\'s Lodgers, The Spectrum Five, and latterly The Tea Set, the band finally became Pink Floyd when Richard Wright rejoined, having returned to the UK to enroll in the Royal College of Music. The new name was suggested by Syd, and was derived from two US bluesmen: Pink (born Pinkney) Anderson and Floyd Council.The 5-piece played intermittently in early 1965 as both The Tea Set and The Pink Floyd (or The Pink Floyd Sound), with the departure of Rado ‘Bob\\' Klose creating the first 4-man (Barrett / Mason / Waters / Wright) lineup at live shows from May onwards, although the band continued to alternate the use of the Tea Set / Pink Floyd designation right up until March 1966.They were still a part-time band, allowing Syd to take off to France in August with David Gilmour, the pair being briefly detained by the St. Tropez police for busking (performing in the street).Pink Floyd / Tea Set\\'s original style was based on American blues and r\\'n\\'b, but the birth of a UK psychedelic music scene allowed them to develop Syd\\'s performance-based ideas into something unique. Throughout 1966 they honed their live performance skills, often developing songs into long jamming sequences, and by the end of the year Pink Floyd had become the pre-eminent ‘underground\\' band. They picked up management too, and their first recordings were songs by Syd, who had established himself as the band\\'s creative innovator.Pink Floyd signed to EMI Records in 1967, releasing the singles Arnold Layne and See Emily Play, both written by Syd, and the album The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, again mostly composed by Syd and considered to be one of the greatest British psychedelic albums.Arnold Layne reached No. 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and See Emily Play reached No. 6, while The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn also entered the album charts at No. 6, the first of a long line of Pink Floyd album chart successes.However, as the band began to attract a large fanbase, it became clear that Syd\\'s fluid approach to writing, performing and recording - spontaneous, one take only, nothing repeated - was increasingly at odds with the expectations of a musical scene that was still very conservative, especially outside London. Possibly exacerbated by Syd\\'s frequent experimentation with psychedelic drugs, his behaviour became more erratic, to the point that the band decided to add a second guitarist for live performances. They hoped to call on Syd\\'s compositional abilities for studio work, similar to Brian Wilson\\'s role in the Beach Boys, while David Gilmour would bolster the band in live shows.David Gilmour had gigged regularly around Cambridge with various outfits, including The Ramblers, Chris Ian &amp; The Newcomers and Jokers Wild, his first professional outfit. David moved to London in Summer 1966, and the band, now a trio, played extensively around Europe. Renamed Bullitt, they then re-invented themselves as Flowers in 1967. Already known as the best guitarist on the Cambridge scene, David had been very impressed with seeing Jimi Hendrix in a small club, and had been inspired to work even harder on his technique.The new 5-man Floyd experiment didn\\'t really work, and in January 1968, after a handful of shows, the band elected not to pick Syd up on the way to a Southampton University gig.Syd and Floyd officially parted company in March 1968, with the band\\'s management Blackhill Enterprises deciding to stick with Syd as a solo artist. The band appointed Steve O\\'Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003.Whilst Syd Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one composition by him, Jugband Blues, appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful Of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching Number 9 in the UK.Point Me At The Sky, a Waters/Gilmour composition released in December 1968, was to be the band\\'s last single release until Money from The Dark Side Of The Moon.The soundtrack to the film More, another UK Top 10 album in July 1969, was the band\\'s first collaboration with film director Barbet Schroeder. The next record, the double album Ummagumma in November 1969, was a mix of live recordings and studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project.Meanwhile, over the course of a year, Syd Barrett had recorded The Madcap Laughs, released in January 1970, with some production help from David and Roger. Atom Heart Mother, in October 1970, was Pink Floyd\\'s first recording with an orchestra, the title track suite taking up a full vinyl LP side. Their first UK No. 1 album, staying on the charts for 18 weeks, the title was taken from a London Evening Standard headline.Roger Waters\\' first work outside the band appeared in November 1970. A collaboration with Ron Geesin, (with whom Floyd had worked on Atom Heart Mother), The Body formed the soundtrack to the film of the same name. Pink Floyd appear anonymously on the track Give Birth To A Smile.November 1970 also saw the release of Barrett, the second and last album of all-original Syd Barrett songs. It was produced by David Gilmour and included Richard Wright on keyboards.Before the next album of original material, a Pink Floyd compilation album, Relics, was released in May 1971, containing several early singles and B-sides, plus one previously unreleased song Biding My Time. The band also contributed three tracks to the soundtrack of Michelangelo Antonioni\\'s film, Zabriskie Point. In October 1971 the band allowed director Adrian Maben to film them performing live in the amphitheatre at Pompeii. After more filming, including interviews and more performances in a Paris studio, the Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii film was finally premiered at the Edinburgh Festival in September 1972.Meddle was Pink Floyd\\'s longest UK chart performer to date, maintaining 82 weeks on the chart from its No. 3 debut in November 1971. It contained the LP side-long Echoes, to many the perfect encapsulation of all Floyd\\'s disparate elements. Nick Mason considered it \"the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to\".Developing the idea of thematic pieces, the band began to work on what would become The Dark Side of The Moon, presenting the songs from the album in concert throughout 1972. However, even though they were yet to enter the studio to record Dark Side as an album, the band took a detour to make another soundtrack album in just two weeks for Barbet Schroeder – Obscured By Clouds, to accompany the film La Vallee.The release of Pink Floyd\\'s massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side Of The Moon, was a watershed moment in the band\\'s popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968\\'s Point Me At The Sky and was never a hit single-driven group, but Money was released as a single from The Dark Side Of The Moon, going Top 20 in the U.S. The album became the band\\'s first No. 1 on the U.S. Charts and is one of the biggest-selling ever, worldwide.The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn and A Saucerful Of Secrets were re-presented to the public in December 1973 as a 2-LP set, A Nice Pair, repackaged in a gatefold sleeve.1975\\'s Wish You Were Here is well-known for its popular title track, but'\n",

      "'Oasis shot from obscurity to stardom in 1994, becoming one of Britain\\'s most popular and critically acclaimed bands of the decade in the process. Along with Blur and Suede, they were responsible for returning British guitar pop to the top of the charts. Led by guitarist/songwriter Noel Gallagher, the Manchester quintet adopted the rough, thuggish image of the Stones and the Who, crossed it with \"Beatlesque\" melodies and hooks, injected distinctly British lyrical themes and song structures like the Jam and the Kinks, and tied it all together with a massive guitar roar, as well as a defiant sneer that drew equally from the Sex Pistols\\' rebelliousness and the Stone Roses\\' cocksure arrogance. Gallagher\\'s songs frequently reworked previous hits from T. Rex (\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\" borrows the riff from \"Bang a Gong\") to Wham! (\"Fade Away\" takes the melody from \"Freedom\"), yet the group always put the hooks in different settings, updating past hits for a new era.Originally, the group was formed by schoolmates Liam Gallagher (vocals), Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass), and Tony McCaroll (drums). After spending several years as the guitar technician for a Stone Roses-inspired group named the Inspiral Carpets, Noel Gallagher returned to Manchester to find that his brother had formed a band. Noel agreed to join if he could have complete control of the group, including contributing all the songs; the rest of the band agreed and adopted a new name, Oasis, before launching a year of intensive rehearsals.After playing a handful of small club gigs, the band cornered Alan McGee, the head of Creation Records, and forced him to listen to their demo. Impressed, he signed the band and helped them ready their debut album. The group released their first single, \"Supersonic,\" in the spring of 1994; it edged its way into the charts on the back of positive reviews. With a melody adapted from \"I\\'d Like to Teach the World to Sing,\" \"Shakermaker\" became a bigger hit in the early summer. Released a month before their debut album\\'s arrival, the soaring ballad \"Live Forever\" became a major hit in England and helped make Definitely Maybe the fastest-selling debut in British history. The record entered the charts at number one and eventually sold over seven million copies.Oasis mania continued throughout 1994, as the group began playing larger theaters and watched each new single outperform the last. However, tensions in the group began to build -- Liam and Noel refused to do joint interviews because they always fought -- and Noel Gallagher briefly left the band at the end of a difficult fall American tour. However, he quickly re-joined and the band headed back to England. As \"Supersonic\" began to climb the U.S. album rock and modern rock charts, the string-laden \"Whatever\" (a non-album single) hit number two over the British Christmas season.At the beginning of 1995, the group set their sights on America by promoting the single \"Live Forever.\" The song became a major hit on MTV and modern rock radio stations, peaking at number two, and Definitely Maybe soon climbed to gold status in the U.S. Returning to England after a sold-out American tour, the group recorded a new single, \"Some Might Say.\" Drummer Tony McCaroll parted ways with the band on the eve of the single\\'s May release, with Alan White taking his place. \"Some Might Say\" entered the charts at number one, and its success led to all of Oasis\\' previous singles reentering the indie charts. Oasis spent the rest of the summer completing their second album, (What\\'s the Story) Morning Glory?, which was released in October of 1995. Upon its release, the album shot to number one in England, becoming the fastest-selling album in the U.K. since Michael Jackson\\'s Bad.The band continued to set records during the following years. Over the course of 1996, (What\\'s the Story) Morning Glory? became the second-biggest British album in history. On the strength of the iconic single \"Wonderwall,\" Morning Glory also became a Top Ten success in America, where it reached quintuple platinum status; it also cracked the Top Ten throughout countries in Europe and Asia. During 1996, the Gallaghers\\' combative relationship was frequently detailed in newspapers and gossip columns, particularly when they suddenly pulled out of their late summer U.S. tour. This followed the group\\'s two concerts at Knebworth, which broke records for being the biggest outdoor concert in England. After Oasis abandoned their American tour, they concentrated on recording their third album. While the band\\'s first two LPs were quickly recorded, they took several months to record the third, which finally saw completion during the spring of 1997. The resulting album, Be Here Now, was released in late August, one month after the arrival of the single \"D\\'You Know What I Mean.\" Greeted with generally enthusiastic reviews and robust sales, Be Here Now shattered sales records in the U.K. and nearly topped the U.S. charts, positioning the quintet as the de facto rulers of rock. However, a backlash set in among both critics and record buyers over the album\\'s perceived excesses, which meant that Be Here Now lacked the shelf life of its predecessors. Not long afterward, typical infighting unraveled the band\\'s tour, and the group disappeared from the spotlight for a time -- although a collection of B-sides, Masterplan, did follow in 1998. As the band was recording their fourth album in the summer of 1999, Bonehead left Oasis, claiming that he wanted to spend more time with his family. Interviewed by NME on August 11, the day after the departure was made public, Noel Gallagher seemed unfazed, stating \"It\\'s hardly Paul McCartney leaving the Beatles.\" Ex-Ride guitarist Andy Bell and onetime Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer signed on after the recording of 2000\\'s Standing on the Shoulder of Giants was completed. In fall 2000, the band celebrated their monumental world tour success with the release of their first-ever live record, Familiar to Millions. The album highlights Oasis\\' July 2000 gig at Wembley Stadium and was released on six different formats including CD and cassette, DVD, VHS, triple vinyl, and mini-disc. Two years later, Oasis surfaced with Heathen Chemistry. Worldwide dates coincided the release of Oasis\\' fifth studio album; however, problems loomed ahead. While touring America in late summer, Noel Gallagher, Andy Bell, and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington were injured in Indianapolis after their taxi collided with another vehicle. The band bounced back soon, returning to the road in two weeks time after canceling shows in Indianapolis, Boston, and Philadelphia. In America, however, the album wasn\\'t faring as well as Oasis\\' tour sales, and the leadoff single \"Hindu Times\" barely made a mark on MTV. More trouble arrived in December, when Liam Gallagher and several members of the Oasis entourage were involved in a street scuffle in Munich; the younger Gallagher sustained facial injuries and was later arrested while two of the band\\'s security guards sought serious medical attention. Despite such setbacks -- which also included mixed reviews for the album -- Heathen Chemistry nevertheless sold several million copies at home and charted four U.K. singles. Additionally, Liam\\'s own composition, \"Songbird,\" marked the first time Oasis had released a single penned by anyone other than Noel. The song fared well on U.K. charts and paved the way for a new collaborative approach to songwriting.Oasis\\' next album suffered delays, as initial sessions with the electronica duo Death in Vegas (who had been recruited to produce the record) were scrapped. Additionally, drummer Alan White made his exit from the band in early 2004, and Ringo Starr\\'s son Zak Starkey climbed aboard to take his place. Don\\'t Believe the Truth eventually saw a worldwide release in May 2005. Featuring songwriting contributions from every bandmember, the record represented a new approach from the previously Noel-dominated group. \"Lyla,\" \"The Importance of Being Idle,\" and \"Let There Be Love\" all contributed to the album\\'s success, and Don\\'t Believe the Truth soon became the band\\'s highest-selling effort since Be Here Now. The band quickly returned to the studio in mid-2007, halting production several months later to allow Noel to spend time with his newborn child. Sessions resumed in November and wrapped up in 2008, with Dig Out Your Soul receiving a release date later that year. In 2009, after a typically heated, backstage sibling altercation, Noel left the group for good, prompting Liam (and the rest of the band) to change the name to Beady Eye, with plans to release a debut single in 2010. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Whereas many of his Spanish-language contemporaries undertook English-language crossover campaigns at one point or another in their careers, Colombian singer/songwriter, guitarist, and author Juanes won global appeal exclusively in his native language and became perhaps the biggest and most important popular Latin music artist in the world in the early 21st century. After his debut album, Fijate Bien (2000), won him the Grammy for Best New Artist (the first of two-dozen including 20 Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammys), Juanes broke through to global success with his second offering, Un Día Normal (2002). In the United States alone, the album rode the Billboard Latin chart for two straight years, remaining in the Top Ten for a record-breaking 92 weeks. It also notched charting hit singles (six), Grammy nominations (eight), Grammy awards (five), and various other accolades. When he returned with his third album, Mi Sangre (2004), Juanes again garnered all kinds of commercial success and critical acclaim. He tirelessly toured in support of the album, and by 2005 he had begun topping the singles chart in non-Spanish-speaking countries such as Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. By the time he returned with his fourth album, La Vida...Es un Ratico (2007), Juanes had such a global presence, Universal chose to release \"Me Enamora,\" the lead single, to media outlets in 77 countries; it became a number one hit in 14 of them, setting the stage for another cycle of commercial success. Each recording since that time has expanded his fan base and creative reach. His 2017 chart-topping outing Mis Planes Son Amarte, was the first complete audio-visual album. Conceptual in origin, each of its songs was released with a corresponding thematic video, creating an expanded narrative. It took home the Latin Grammy for Best Rock/Pop Album. After again hitting number one on the Latin Pop Album chart with 2019\\'s Más Futuro Que Pasado, Juanes showcased his influences on the 2021 covers album Origen.Born Juan Esteban Aristizábal Vásquez on August 9, 1972, in Carolina del Príncipe, Antioquia, Colombia, Juanes began to learn how to play guitar at age seven, taught by his father and older brothers. His passion for the instrument led him to learn traditional Latin sounds such as boleros, tangos, and cumbias as well as Colombian folk music styles such as vallenato and guasca. During his upbringing in Colombia he also became steadily acquainted with the grief endured by his fellow countrymen: His cousin was executed by kidnappers, and a close friend was killed by gunmen. He also lost his father to cancer.As a teenager, Juanes and his guitar playing drifted toward heavy metal, influenced greatly by Metallica and other bands of that ilk. This led to his founding of the metal band Ekhymosis, which went on to considerable success, releasing seven albums in ten years (1988-1998) and enjoying a sizable following in Colombia. He eventually chose to depart the band and pursue a solo career. With guitar in hand, he moved to Los Angeles and brought along a cassette demo that got passed along to producer Gustavo Santaolalla, an Argentine transplant. Santaolalla heard promise in the demo, contacted Juanes, and ultimately signed him to his record label, Surco.In 2000, Juanes and Santaolalla began work on what would become Fijate Bien, and the singer/songwriter/guitarist also partnered with manager Fernan Martinez, a fellow Colombian who had previously stood beside Enrique Iglesias during that artist\\'s rise to international fame. With everything in place for Juanes, Surco, in association with Universal Music Latino, released Fijate Bien on October 17, 2000. The album sold very well in Colombia, where it spent ten weeks at number one, but it was slow to catch on elsewhere, spinning off a few modest hits: the title track, \"Nada,\" and \"Podemos Hacernos Dano.\" It was a pleasant surprise, then, when it was announced in July 2001 that Juanes had received a whopping seven Latin Grammy nominations. Such recognition brought a lot of international attention to Fijate Bien, especially once Juanes won three Grammys, including Best New Artist. He also performed at the ceremony.Immediately following his Grammy wins, Juanes returned to Santaolalla\\'s Surco studio in Los Angeles, bringing with him demos for over 40 new songs that would become the basis of Un Día Normal. He completed work on the album in February 2002 and the lead single, \"A Dios le Pido,\" was sent to radio stations throughout the U.S. and Latin America in April. The God-addressing song became an anthem in much of Latin America, a sort of prayer for peace throughout that often-troubled part of the world. It went on to top the charts in 12 countries on three continents, and spent 47 consecutive weeks on Billboard\\'s Hot Latin Tracks chart, with a large percentage of those weeks spent firmly lodged in the Top Five. It also spent more than four straight months atop the Colombian chart, breaking a record formerly held by countrymate Shakira. Surco/Universal unveiled Un Día Normal in May 2002, and it lived up to the promise of its lead single and its predecessor, becoming perhaps the most successful Latin album released to date. The album was much brighter than Fijate Bien (Juanes himself described Un Día Normal as the dawn that followed the night of its predecessor), and it spun off numerous hit singles, most notably a duet ballad with Nelly Furtado, \"Fotografia,\" which the duo would go on to perform at the next Latin Grammy ceremony. Un Día Normal sold millions of copies worldwide, spending 92 weeks in the Top Ten of Billboard\\'s Top Latin Albums chart. Its accolades are far too many to list, as seemingly the entire world seemed to celebrate Juanes throughout the remainder of 2002 and into the following year. He toured the world and set all kinds of attendance records, performed at all kinds of ceremonies and telecasts, and inspired gushing praise from critics.Following the whirlwind of Un Día Normal, Juanes once again headed straight to the studio in May 2004, to begin work on what would become Mi Sangre. The lead single, \"Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor,\" hit radio on August 12, 2004, bumped up to prevent unauthorized leaks, and the album hit the streets in September. Critics generally loved Mi Sangre, legions of fans bought it, and Juanes promoted it nonstop, once again mounting a mammoth tour (over 200 dates) and performing at all kinds of telecasts, in-stores, and ceremonies. All the while he again swept up one award after another (including France\\'s highest cultural honor, L\\'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres) and tallied up yet more chart-topping hits (including \"La Camisa Negra,\" which was a number one hit across Western Europe, in addition to the Americas). Though his chart-topping was confined to the Latin market in the United States, Juanes was recognized for his global outreach, as Time magazine counted him among its list of \"the 100 most influential people in the world today.\"La Vida...Es un Ratico (2007), Juanes\\' fourth album, was globally anticipated and proved an immediate hit. The album\\'s lead single, \"Me Enamora,\" had already hit number one in 14 countries by the time of the album\\'s release, including seven consecutive weeks atop the Billboard Latin chart in the United States. In Colombia, physical copies of La Vida...Es un Ratico were reportedly sold out within the first day of release. His fifth studio album, 2010\\'s P.A.R.C.E., was recorded in London and produced by Stephen Lipson. Tr3s Presents Juanes: MTV Unplugged, a career-spanning live set recorded in Miami Beach in front of an enthusiastic audience, appeared in 2012. Juanes re-emerged with the pre-release single \"La Luz\" in December of 2013. It nailed the top spot on various Billboard Latin charts. His follow-up album, Loco de Amor, was produced by Steve Lillywhite and issued in March of 2014. It too reached number one on the Latin charts, as well as in Colombia, and won Juanes a Latin Grammy as well, for Best Pop/Rock Album. The Colombian rocker involved himself in various social concerns for the next few years, all the while conceiving another album. As he wrote, he began to think first conceptually and then visually. He co-produced a set of 11 thematically linked tracks with fellow Colombians Sky &amp; Mosty and Bull Nene. He also enlisted director Kacho Lopez to helm an accompanying film. The finished product offered the tale of an astronaut traveling the spaceways to find love through time travel all over the world. Juanes\\' film bridges science and ancient spiritual and healing traditions. Each song -- including Juanes\\' first Anglo-language cut, \"Goodbye for Now\" co-written with Poo Bear -- had its own video. In October of 2016, he dropped the first single \"Fuego\" followed by \"Hermosa Ingrata\" in January of 2017. Both tracks landed at the top of various charts while their videos racked up tens of millions of views. \"Angel\" and \"El Ratico\" (feat. Kali Uchis) were released in April, with \"Goodbye for Now\" and \"Es Tarde\" following in weekly installments until the release of the full-length, Mis Planes Son Amarte, in mid-May; it was the first audio-visual album released by a Latin musician. Juanes was also the subject of the HBO Latino special featuring an in-studio performance of the album, followed by the 30-minute film The Juanes Effect: De Canciones y Transformactiones. The album debuted at number one on the Top Latin Albums charts and was nominated for a Latin Grammy for Best Latin Pop Album. In 2018, during his U.S. tour, his 2002 song \"A Dios le Pido\" was named one of the 50 Greatest Latin Songs (1950-present) by Rolling Stone magazine. Juanes issued the single \"La Plata\" in January of 2019, followed that May by \"Querer Mejor\" featuring Alessia Cara. In September, he and countryman Sebastian Yatra issued the single \"Bonita,\" which went Top Ten at Latin radio. He followed with the single and video for \"Aurora,\" featuring upcoming rapper and fellow Medellin-born Crudo Means Raw. On November 14, Juanes was honored as the 2019 Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year as they recognized his \"creative artistry, unprecedented humanitarian efforts, support for rising artists, and philanthropic contributions to the world.\" He was also nominated for three Latin Grammys including Song of the Year and Record of the Year. On November 22, Juanes issued his eighth album, Más Futuro Que Pasado, on which he experimented with the sounds of Colombian popular music such as cumbia, guasca, and vallenato, and melded them to rock, trap, and reggaeton. In addition to the singles listed above, the set included collaborations with Christian Nodal and Fuego. Juanes was inspired to experiment with wedding folk, popular traditional styles, and urban music by working with young co-producers including Andrés and Mauricio, Mosty, Rafael Arcaute, Tainy, Luis Salazar, Ily Wonder, DVLP, and Sky. A covers album, the Grammy-nominated Origen, arrived in May 2021 and found Juanes interpreting songs by some of his biggest influences. Included were tunes originally done by Carlos Gardel, Juan Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Marley, and others. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

      "'Relying on their top-notch songwriting and impeccable vocals, the Bee Gees were able to craft a long-running career that began in the late \\'50s in Australia. Along the way they became a hit-producing psychedelic pop group in England during the \\'60s and the biggest disco band in the world in the \\'70s, and had a late comeback as adult contemporary crooners in the \\'90s. Their long-reaching influence extended past sales figures and saw their sound and style mirrored in acts as disparate as Justin Timberlake and of Montreal.The group was also music\\'s most successful brother act. Barry Gibb, born on September 1, 1946, in Manchester, England, and his fraternal twin brothers Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb, born on December 22, 1949, on the Isle of Man, were three of five children. The three of them gravitated toward music, encouraged by their father, who saw his sons at first as a diminutive version of the Mills Brothers. The three Gibb brothers made their earliest performances at local movie theaters in Manchester in 1955, singing between shows. The family moved to Australia in 1958, resettling near Brisbane. Now known as the Brothers Gibb -- with Barry writing songs -- they attracted the attention of a local DJ, and eventually got their own local television show. It was around this time that they took on the name the Bee Gees (for Brothers Gibb). The trio was astoundingly popular in the press and on television, but actual hit records eluded them. By late 1966, they\\'d decided to return to England -- which, thanks to the Beatles, was now the center of the world for rock and popular music. The group had sent demo recordings ahead of them, and \"Spicks &amp; Specks\" -- which became their first Australian hit while they were in mid-ocean -- had attracted the interest of manager Robert Stigwood. The trio was signed by Stigwood upon their arrival, and began shaping their sound in the environment of Swinging London. Barry and Robin Gibb alternated the lead vocal spot, harmonizing together and with Maurice. Barry played rhythm guitar, while Maurice played bass, piano, organ, and Mellotron, among other instruments. Their first English recording, \"New York Mining Disaster 1941,\" an original by the group with a haunting melody and a strangely surreal, almost psychedelic ambience, was released in mid-1967 and made the Top 20 in England and America. They had successful follow-ups with \"Holiday\" and \"To Love Somebody,\" the latter actually written for Otis Redding to record, and \"Massachusetts,\" which topped the U.K. charts. After Bee Gees\\' 1st, the Gibb brothers took over producing their own records. It was easy, amid the sheer beauty of their recordings, to overlook the range of influences that went into their sound, which came from a multitude of sources, including American country music and soul music. At this point in their history, they were most comfortable deconstructing elements in the singing and harmonies of Black American music and rebuilding them in their style.In 1969, the trio split up in a dispute involving the Odessa album. A lushly orchestrated double LP, it was their most ambitious recording to date, but they were unable to agree on which song would be the single, and Robin walked out. Barry and Maurice held on to the Bee Gees name for one LP, Cucumber Castle, while Robin released Robin\\'s Reign. Without a group to promote it, the Odessa album never sold the way it might have, even with a hit, \"First of May.\" Cucumber Castle generated several successful singles in England and Germany, including the gorgeous, African-influenced \"I.O.I.O.,\" while Robin had a hit with \"Saved by the Bell.\"In 1970, almost two years older and a good deal wiser, they decided to get back together. They related to each other better and had also evolved musically, now creating a progressive pop/rock sound similar to the Moody Blues. They came back on a high note with two dazzling songs: the soulful \"Lonely Days,\" the group\\'s first number one hit in America; and the achingly lyrical \"Morning of My Life,\" which proved so popular with fans that the group was still doing it in concert decades later.Their success began to ebb, however, after another huge international hit with \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\" in 1971. The single \"Run to Me\" made the Top 20 in 1972, but the album To Whom It May Concern was forgotten almost instantly after a brief chart run. Their fortunes continued in reverse during 1973 with Life in a Tin Can and the single \"Saw a New Morning\" -- despite a move to America and a heavy promotional push, the song never made the Top 40 and the album stalled out. The trio was falling into a deep creative and commercial hole. Rescue came from a suggestion by Eric Clapton that they try recording at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, where he had just cut an album. The Bee Gees took his advice and came back with Mr. Natural (1974), produced by Arif Mardin. This record was a departure with its heavily Americanized R&amp;B sound, and the following year they plunged headfirst into the new sound with Main Course -- the emphasis was now on dance rhythms, high harmonies, and a funk beat. And spearheading the new sound was Barry Gibb, who, for the first time, sang falsetto and discovered that he could delight audiences in that register. \"Jive Talkin\\',\" the first single off the album, became their second American number one single, and was followed up with \"Nights on Broadway\" and then the album Children of the World, which yielded the hits \"You Should Be Dancing\" and \"Love So Right.\" Then, in 1977, their featured numbers on the soundtrack to the Robert Stigwood-produced Saturday Night Fever, \"Stayin\\' Alive,\" \"How Deep Is Your Love,\" and \"Night Fever,\" each topped the charts, even as the soundtrack album stayed in the top spot for 24 weeks. In the process, the disco era in America was born -- Saturday Night Fever, as an album and a film, supercharged the phenomenon and broadened its audience by tens of millions, with the Bee Gees at the forefront of the music. It was a profound moment although, ironically, there wasn\\'t that much difference in their sound. Amid the dance numbers, the Bee Gees still did a healthy portion of romantic ballads that each offered memorable hooks. They\\'d simply decided, at Arif Mardin\\'s urging, to forget the fact that they were white Englishmen and plunged into soul music, emulating, in their own terms, the funkier Philadelphia soul sounds that all three brothers knew and loved. In one fell swoop, the group had managed to meld every influence they\\'d ever embraced, from the Mills Brothers and the Beatles to early-\\'70s soul, into something of their own that was virtually irresistible. Spirits Having Flown was their crowning commercial triumph, topping 30 million in sales and yielding three more number one singles. By the end of the \\'70s, however, the disco era was waning from a combination of the bad economy, political chaos domestically and internationally (leading to the election of Ronald Reagan), and a general burnout of the participants from too many drugs and profligate sex (which would precipitate an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases and herald the outbreak of AIDS in the United States). There had already been an ad hoc reaction against the group\\'s dominance of the airwaves, with mass burnings of Bee Gees posters and albums organized by DJs. The Bee Gees themselves helped contribute to the end of the party with their participation (at Stigwood\\'s insistence) in the film Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band, \"inspired\" (if that\\'s the word) by the Beatles album. The movie was a commercial and critical disaster, and an embarrassment to all concerned.In America, the Bee Gees were virtually invisible for most of the \\'80s. Instead, Barry Gibb pursued work as a producer for other artists, creating hits for Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross. By 1987 and the E.S.P. album, their sales had rebounded everywhere but the United States, yielding a number one single (outside of the U.S.) in \"You Win Again.\" Their 1989 album, One, got a good reception around the world and generated a Top Ten U.S. single. And in the \\'90s, PolyGram Records released the four-CD anthology Tales from the Brothers Gibb, which sold well around the world. The trio\\'s 1997 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame led to a resurgence of interest, which heralded the release of the live album One Night Only (1998), cut at their first American concert in almost a decade.The Bee Gees remained active until the January 2003 death of Maurice from cardiac arrest during surgery. Following his death, Robin and Barry decided to cease performing as the Bee Gees. Their recorded legacy, however, subsequently became more visible than it had been in decades with the move of their catalog to Warner/Reprise. The latter company began the long-awaited upgraded CD reissue of the Bee Gees\\' post-1966 library, including the first-ever release of outtakes and rehearsal versions of songs. Robin was diagnosed with and underwent treatment for cancer in 2011. He died in London in May 2012 due to complications from cancer and intestinal surgery; he was 62 years old. Given the previous deaths of Andy (who had several number one hits and who died of an inflammatory heart virus in 1988) and Maurice Gibb, Robin was the third Gibb brother and second member of the Bee Gees to pass away. In the wake of tragedy, Barry kept working, appearing on other people\\'s records, playing concerts, and releasing a solo album titled In the Now in 2016. The next year the Bee Gees were honored at the 2017 Grammys; then their music was featured in the star-studded concert Stayin\\' Alive: A Grammy Salute to the Music of the Bee Gees, which was broadcast by CBS in April. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi'\n",

      "'A New York icon and one of the most successful singer/songwriters of the late 20th century, Billy Joel rose to success in the mid-\\'70s with a melodic piano-led pop sound that merged Beatlesque hooks with elements of rock, jazz, Tin Pan Alley, and even Broadway. A Long Island native with a powerful voice and knack for storytelling, Joel first made the pop charts with \"Piano Man,\" a rousing barroom singalong with a bittersweet old-timey feel that became his signature song. Released in 1977, his fifth album, The Stranger, launched him into superstardom yielding four Top 40 hits including \"Only the Good Die Young\" and the Grammy Award-winning soft rock ballad \"Just the Way You Are.\" By the end of the \\'70s, Joel was a major concert draw and one of the top American pop artists with a string of massive hits to his credit including \"Movin\\' Out,\" \"My Life,\" and \"She\\'s Always a Woman.\" His success continued into the \\'80s with albums like Glass Houses and An Innocent Man, the latter of which helped usher him into the MTV era with its \"Uptown Girl\" video starring his wife, supermodel Christie Brinkley. Released in 1985 his double-disc Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 &amp; 2 became a ubiquitous chart presence, eventually earning Diamond certification. Joel\\'s success extended well beyond the U.S. and he even reached across the Iron Curtain, doing a high-profile tour of the Soviet Union in the late \\'80s. He ended the decade on top with 1989\\'s Storm Front and its smash hit \"We Didn\\'t Start the Fire.\" Released in 1993, River of Dreams proved to be Joel\\'s last release of pop material and, aside from a 2001 album of original classical material, he shifted into legacy mode in the 21st century. Joel remained a significant concert draw, touring frequently throughout the 2000s and 2010s, occasionally as part of a popular package with Elton John. Among the many honors bestowed upon him was an induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Kennedy Center Honors, and the only retired number by a non-athlete at New York\\'s Madison Square Garden arena where he began a monthly residency gig in 2014. After the residency was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Joel made a grand return to his hometown arena in late 2021.Born on May 9, 1949 in the Bronx, Joel was raised in the Long Island suburb of Hicksville, where he learned to play piano as a child. As he approached his adolescence, Joel started to rebel, joining teenage street gangs and boxing as welterweight. He fought a total of 22 fights as a teenager, and during one of the fights, he broke his nose. For the early years of his adolescence, he divided his time between studying piano and fighting. Upon seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, Joel decided to pursue a full-time musical career and set about finding a local Long Island band to join. Eventually, he found the Echoes, a group that specialized in British Invasion covers. The Echoes became a popular New York attraction, convincing him to quit high school to become a professional musician.In 1965, while still a member of the Echoes, Joel began working as a session musician.'\n",

      "'The most commercially successful Spanish singer of all time, Alejandro Sanz earned a reputation as an industrious hitmaker in his native country during the 1990s, and by the decade\\'s end, he\\'d expanded his fan base internationally, broadening his style beyond romantic ballads and collaborating with fellow Latin superstars, most memorably Shakira. A talented and charismatic performer, Sanz proved immensely popular even with his debut album, 1991\\'s Viviendo de Prisa, which was a number one hit in Spain. However, it wasn\\'t until several albums later, 1997\\'s Más, that he was able to break into the international market, thanks to a key hit single, \"Corazón Partío,\" that transcended his core female audience. He began focusing on the Americas during the early 2000s, beginning in 2001 with MTV Unplugged, which was recorded in Miami and subsequently released as an album intended to showcase the highlights of his back catalog as well as a newly written single, \"Y Sólo Se Me Ocurre Amarte.\" Sanz then retreated to his studio to record his most broadly appealing album yet. Released in 2003, No Es Lo Mismo found him breaking away from audience expectations and exploring his own musical interests. He did much the same on his next album, 2006\\'s El Tren de los Momentos, which was highlighted by \"Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No,\" a passionate duet with Shakira, whom he\\'d collaborated with the previous year on her massive Grammy-winning hit \"La Tortura.\" He took a small detour into relatively straight pop with 2015\\'s smash-hit Sirope, which netted him his 15th Latin Grammy, this one for Best Contemporary Pop Vocal Album. More Latin Grammys followed for 2019\\'s #ElDisco, which also topped the charts in Spain, as did 2021\\'s Sanz. Born in Madrid, on December 18, 1968, Alejandro Sánchez Pizarro was the youngest son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez, both of whom were Andalusian. His father played guitar professionally and was a significant influence on Alejandro, who learned to play guitar as a boy. As a teenager, Sanz performed at local venues and eventually became acquainted with Miguel Angel Arenas, a music industry maven perhaps best known at the time for his association with Mecano, a successful Spanish pop/rock group of the \\'80s. Arenas helped Sanz find work in the recording industry, and the young performer initially signed a contract with the Spanish label Hispavox, which issued Los Chulos Son Pa\\' Cuidarlos (1989), an album that was met with indifference upon its release and is now a curious collector\\'s item. Sanz was billed as Alejandro Magno on the album. Remaining aligned with Arenas, Sanz subsequently moved to WEA Latina, where he began recording music under his present billing. His early albums -- 1991\\'s Viviendo de Prisa, 1993\\'s Si Tu Me Miras and Basico, and 1995\\'s 3 -- were loaded with hit singles and consequently were all successful, each reaching platinum status many times over in Spain. Comprised largely of romantic songs, these early albums connected well with sentimental listeners, particularly women, who tended to be as taken aback by the music as they were by Sanz\\'s looks. \"La Fuerza del Corazón,\" from 3, was his first major hit to have an international reach, opening a door to greener pastures. The stage was now set for the breakthrough success of 1997\\'s Más, which boasted \"Corazón Partío,\" a hit so big it changed the course of Sanz\\'s career. Driven by the across-the-board appeal of \"Corazón Partío,\" as well as additional singles \"Y, ¿Si Fuera Ella?,\" \"Amiga Mía,\" \"Aquello Que Me Diste,\" and \"Siempre Es de Noche,\" Más became the most successful Spanish pop record ever, selling millions worldwide. El Alma al Aire, released in 2000, was a comparable commercial success, selling well internationally. However, the album wasn\\'t as solid as its predecessor and accordingly spawned fewer hits: \"Cuando Nadie Me Ve,\" \"Quisiera Ser...,\" and \"El Alma el Aire,\" each of which was a big hit nonetheless. By this point, Sanz had garnered a sizable following across the Atlantic, and his next recording, 2001\\'s MTV Unplugged, was a clear effort to further his growing popularity in the Americas. The intimate concert performance featured a newly written single, \"Y Sólo Se Me Ocurre Amarte,\" which became a hit, as did \"Aprendiz,\" a song written by Sanz previously recorded by Malú in 1998. MTV Unplugged moreover showcased the bounty of career highlights Sanz now had to his credit, as one hit after another was performed during the concert.When Sanz returned to the studio to begin recording his next album, No Es Lo Mismo, he decided to broaden his musical style to reflect his own interests. Released in 2003, the album was harder-hitting and more street-savvy than past ones, even including a bit of rap and touches of electronica. The romantic songs were still front and center, granted, but Sanz wrote an album far from generic, illustrating his growing reluctance to cater to the expectations of his audience; for the first time, he co-produced the album himself. Though bolder than before, No Es Lo Mismo was yet another international smash success, reaching number 128 on the all-inclusive Billboard 200 album chart -- a notably high ranking for a Latin pop album circa 2003 -- and generating several hits, none bigger than the title track. \"No Es Lo Mismo\" hit the Top Five on the Hot Latin Tracks chart (the first time Sanz did so since 1998) and was licensed by Coca-Cola for a promotional campaign in Latin America. Furthermore, the album won a Latin Grammy in 2003 for Best Latin Pop Album, and Warner Music Latina issued a special audio/video edition of the album the following year in commemoration of Sanz\\'s Latin American tour. In 2004, Warner also released a pair of greatest-hits compilations, Grandes Éxitos 91_96 and Grandes Éxitos 97_04, as well as a three-disc package, Grandes Éxitos 91_04, that included a disc of rarities.Sanz didn\\'t return with his follow-up, El Tren de los Momentos, until late 2006, but in the meantime, he was featured on the biggest Latin hit of 2005, Shakira\\'s \"La Tortura.\" He co-wrote the Grammy-winning song and co-starred in its heavily aired pair of videos, which featured the two Latin pop stars in some rather sultry positions. \"La Tortura\" exposed Sanz to an even greater audience, and when he finally released the lead single to El Tren de los Momentos, \"A la Primera Persona,\" the reception was rapturous. The song was among his biggest hits yet, his first to break into the all-inclusive Hot 100 chart, and El Tren de los Momentos was likewise well received. Stylistically similar to No Es Lo Mismo yet significantly more refined, El Tren de los Momentos is notable for its several superstar features, which include collaborations with Shakira, Juanes, Alex González of Maná, and Residente of Calle 13. Sanz returned three years later with 2009\\'s Paraiso Express. Considered a return to form by critics, the album saw Sanz relying on the more melodic sound of his earlier work. The single \"Looking for Paradise\" (featuring Alicia Keys) reached the number one spot on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. The album hit number one in Spain and Mexico, and the following year was nominated for Album of the Year at the Latin Grammy Awards. After some 20 years with Warner, Sanz signed a new contract with Universal Music at the beginning of 2011.In 2012, Sanz released his ninth studio album, La Música No Se Toca. Driven by the singles \"No Me Compares\" and \"Se Vende,\" the album became one of the biggest hits of his career, spending nearly a month at the top of the Spanish and Mexican charts. The next year was relatively quiet for Sanz, although he did hit the Top Ten in Spain with a non-album single, \"This Game Is Over,\" featuring Emeli Sandé and Jamie Foxx. Sanz returned in March of 2015 with the pre-release single \"Un Zombie a la Intemperie.\" The tune topped various song charts in Spain and 27 Latin American countries. The subsequent album, Sirope, issued in early May, made its debut at number one on many Latin album charts. A follow-up concert album, Sirope Vivo, was released near the end of the year and also hit the top spot on various Latin albums charts. Another concert album, +Es+ el Concierto, arrived in December 2017, and showcased Sanz\\'s performance earlier in the year at Spain\\'s Vicente Calderon Stadium. December 2018 saw Sanz issue the emotional single \"No Tengo Nada\" ahead of the release of 2019\\'s #ElDisco, which again reached number one in Spain and two on the Latin charts in both Mexico and the United States. The album also netted him three Latin Grammys, including two for the chart-topping single \"My Personal Favorita\" (Record of the Year and Best Pop Song). He followed it at the end of the year with the live #ElGira de #ElDisco, a document from a sold-out concert in Madrid that topped the Spanish album charts in advance of a world tour. In October 2021, he received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before returning that December with the full-length Sanz, which again topped the charts in Spain. More standalone tracks followed, including 2022\\'s \"Nasa\" with Camilo and 2023\\'s \"Correcaminos\" with Danny Ocean. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

      "'Singer Alejandro \"El Potrillo\" Fernández is one of Mexico\\'s biggest international music stars. The son of icon Vicente Fernández, he established himself as a ranchero singer during the 1990s. His self-titled debut album was nominated for Regional Mexican Album of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards in 1993. Four years and four albums later, he debuted his first foray into Latin pop with the chart-topping Me Estoy Enamorando. He hasn\\'t been a stranger to the charts since. Nine of his albums have ascended to the top spot on Latin Pop charts, while 11 more have entered the U.S. Top 200. 2000\\'s Entre Tus Brazos was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the inaugural Latin Grammy Awards. 2004\\'s chart-topping A Corazón Abierto wed classic Mexican romantic balladry to Latin pop production. 2009\\'s Dos Mundos topped the charts and was certified multi-platinum. In 2017, Rompiendo Fronteras combined the ranchera sound with Latin pop and reggaeton productions, earning multi-platinum certification. In 2020, Fernandez issued Hecho en Mexico, his formal return to folk music, recording only norteno and mariachi after two decades of flirting with pop. It topped the Latin albums and Mexican Regional charts and went to 65 in the Top 200.Born on April 24, 1971, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, Fernández is the son of ranchera icon Vicente Fernández, which inspired the media to nickname him \"El Potrillo\" (the Little Colt). Beginning with his self-titled debut album in 1992, Fernández followed in the footsteps of his father, performing traditional Mexican music of the Jalisco region such as mariachi.While this phase of Fernández\\'s career -- which included the albums Alejandro Fernandez (1992), Piel de Niña (1993), Grandes Exitos a la Manera de Alejandro Fernandez (1994), Que Seas Muy Feliz (1995), and Muy Dentro de Mi Corazón (1996), all of which were produced by Pedro Ramírez -- spawned a steady series of hit singles, his career skyrocketed to new heights of success with the 1997 release of Me Estoy Enamorando. Produced by Emilio Estefan, Jr. and Kike Santander -- far and away the preeminent Latin pop production team of the era -- the album marked Fernández\\'s crossover into the realm of mainstream pop. Not only did Me Estoy Enamorando itself top Billboard\\'s Top Latin Albums chart, it also spawned four Hot Latin Tracks chart-toppers with \"Si Tú Supieras,\" \"En el Jardín\" (a duet with Gloria Estefan), \"No Sé Olvidar,\" and \"Yo Nací Para Amarte.\" As if to reassure his fan base that he hadn\\'t abandoned his roots, Fernández reunited with longtime producer Pedro Ramírez in 1999 and returned to ranchera music on Mi Verdad before collaborating once again with Estefan and Santander on another pop-oriented chart-topper, Entre Tus Brazos, in 2000. In subsequent years, Fernández continued to alternate between traditional albums of ranchera music (Orígenes, 2001; Niña, Amada Mía, 2003) and those oriented toward contemporary Latin pop (A Corazón Abierto, 2004; Viento a Favor, 2007). In addition, he began regularly releasing live-in-concert albums (Un Canto de México, 2002; En Vivo: Juntos por Ultima Vez, 2003; México-Madrid: En Directo y Sin Escalas, 2005) and also released his first greatest-hits collection, 15 Años de Éxitos (2008).Following the end of his seven-album contract with Sony, Fernández left the label and signed to Fonovisa. Sony then tried to release an album of his previously unreleased tracks. Fernández sued, and 6,000 copies of the album were seized by police. In 2009, under his new label, he launched an ambitious project called Dos Mundos, which consisted of two separate albums, Evolución and Tradición, released on the same day; the former was more Latin pop, the latter traditional ranchera and mariachi music. (Predictably, Evolución fared slightly better on the pop charts, although both albums were hits.) He then took the new music on tour, resulting in the live album Dos Mundos: Revolución (2010). Fernández began recording again in 2012, working in Los Angeles with producer Phil Ramone. The resulting album, Confidencias, included duets with Christina Aguilera on \"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti,\" Rod Stewart on \"Nobody Knows You When You\\'re Down and Out,\" and most poetically, his father, Vicente, on \"Me Olvidé de Vivir.\" Released in July 2013, the album hit the top of the charts in Mexico and Spain and continued to chart for over a year. Still in the collaborative spirit, Fernández worked with a variety of different artists on his next album, from Colombian band Morat to Peruvian singer/songwriter Gianmarco. It contained four songs by the venerable Joss Favela as well as a pair by Mario Dom. Released in 2017, Rompiendo Fronteras (\"Breaking Barriers\") took a multi-cultural stance amid the political climate of the day and offered rancheras and ballads with modern pop production and rhythms. It made the Top 200 and charted at number one in Latin Pop and Top Latin Albums. In 2020, Fernández issued Hecho en Mexico (\"Made in Mexico\"), his first outing to be exclusively comprised of mariachi songs. Its first single, \"Caballero,\" scored Fernández his first number one on the Regional Mexican Airplay chart. The song \"Menti\" was a duet between the singer and his father, while another, \"Mas No Puedo,\" featured Christian Nodal. The album entered the Latin albums and Mexican Regional chart at number one -- his seventh to do so -- and made Fernández the first artist to achieve Top Latin Albums number ones in four consecutive decades: 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s. The album also registered at number 65 in the general release Top 200. After touring nonstop across 2021 and most of 2022, Fernández issued the mariachi single \"Inexperto en Olvidarte\" on January 6, 2023. The track marked the first time the singer had included a song written by two women -- the recently formed hit team of Sinaloans Fernanda Díaz and Amanda Coronel -- on one of his recordings. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

      "'The Eagles were unquestionably the biggest mainstream American rock band to emerge in the 1970s. Not only did they sell more records and concert tickets than their peers -- Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) and Hotel California are two of the biggest-selling albums of all time -- but they captured the shifting zeitgeist of the \\'70s, riding the country-rock hippie hangover at the end of the \\'60s until it reached the slick, expensive, and expansive pop/rock of Southern California in the late \\'70s. Co-leaders Don Henley and Glenn Frey didn\\'t seem like brothers, but rather partners who made a pact to lead a coolly professional outfit designed to maximize their impact. This was not a group of teenage friends who played local dances together. Every one of the original members -- Henley, Frey, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner -- had headed toward LA with different bands and once those groups fell apart, they stuck around town, playing whatever gig that happened to show up. For all four, one of those gigs was supporting Linda Ronstadt in 1971. The chemistry was evident on-stage and in the studio, so the quartet decided to form a band, releasing their debut in 1972. Hits came swiftly but stardom didn\\'t settle in until the latter half of the decade, after 1975\\'s One of These Nights became a smash. Soon afterward, Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975) turned their early years into canon and then came 1976\\'s Hotel California, a record that defined all manners of \\'70s excess. By that point, the band\\'s lineup had shifted -- Leadon and Meisner were out, as was Leadon\\'s replacement Don Felder; guitarist Joe Walsh and bassist Timothy B Schmit were in -- and the group turned out to be ill-equipped to handle their mega-stardom. One more record, 1979\\'s The Long Run, appeared before the band split, with Henley and Frey achieving considerable solo success during the \\'80s. Rumors of reunions never abated, not even when Henley quipped that hell would freeze over before the Eagles would play again and, eventually, an album materialized in 1993, when the Hotel California-era band adopted the MTV Unplugged format for their own needs on an album naturally called Hell Freezes Over. From that point on, Eagles tours were regular events -- sometimes they were ambitious endeavors, sometimes they were a gig or two, the one thing in common being their success -- and although the group continued to thrive on the existence of its back catalog, they recorded a brand-new double-album called Long Road Out of Eden, a record that once again put the Eagles on the top of the charts in 2007. The band was formed by four Los Angeles-based musicians who had migrated to the West Coast from other parts of the country. Singer/bassist Randy Meisner moved to L.A. in 1964 as part of a band originally called the Soul Survivors (not to be confused with the East Coast-based Soul Survivors, who scored a Top Five hit with \"Expressway to Your Heart\" in 1967) and later renamed the Poor. He became a founding member of Poco in 1968, but left the band prior to the release of its debut album in order to join the Stone Canyon Band, the backup group for Rick Nelson. Meanwhile, singer/guitarist/banjoist/mandolinist Bernie Leadon arrived in L.A. in 1967 as a member of Hearts and Flowers, later joining Dillard &amp; Clark and then the Flying Burrito Brothers. Singer/drummer Don Henley moved to L.A. in June 1970 with his band Shiloh, who made one self-titled album for Amos Records before breaking up. Finally, Glenn Frey performed in his hometown and served as a backup musician for Bob Seger before moving to L.A. in the summer of 1968. He formed the duo Longbranch Pennywhistle with J.D. Souther, and the two musicians signed to Amos Records, which released their self-titled album in 1969. In the spring of 1971, Frey and Henley were hired to play in Linda Ronstadt\\'s backup band. Meisner and Leadon also played backup for Ronstadt during her summer tour, though the four only did one gig together: a July show at Disneyland. They did, however, all appear on Ronstadt\\'s next album, Linda Ronstadt. In September 1971, Frey, Henley, Leadon, and Meisner signed with manager David Geffen, agreeing to record for his soon-to-be-launched label, Asylum Records; soon after, they adopted the name the Eagles. In February 1972, they flew to England and spent two weeks recording their debut album, Eagles, with producer Glyn Johns. It was released in June, reaching the Top 20 and going gold in a little over a year-and-a-half on the strength of two Top Ten hits -- \"Take It Easy\" and \"Witchy Woman\" -- and one Top 20 hit, \"Peaceful Easy Feeling.\" The Eagles toured as an opening act throughout 1972 and into early 1973, when they returned to England to record their second LP, Desperado, a concept album about outlaws. Produced by Glyn Johns and released in April 1973, it reached the Top 40 and went gold in a little less than a year and a half, spawning the Top 40 single \"Tequila Sunrise\" in the process. The title track, though never released as a single, became one of the band\\'s better-known songs and was included on the Eagles\\' first hits collection. After touring to support Desperado\\'s release, the Eagles again convened a recording session with Glyn Johns for their third album. Their desire to make harder rock music clashed with Johns\\' sense of them as a country-rock band, however, and they split from the producer after recording two tracks, \"You Never Cry Like a Lover\" and \"The Best of My Love.\" After an early 1974 tour opened by singer/guitarist Joe Walsh, the band decided to hire Walsh\\'s producer, Bill Szymczyk, who handled the rest of the sessions for On the Border. Szymczyk brought in a session guitarist, Don Felder (born in Gainesville, Florida, on September 21, 1947), an old friend of Bernie Leadon\\'s who so impressed the rest of the band that he was recruited to join the group. On the Border was released in March 1974. It went gold and reached the Top Ten in June, the Eagles\\' fastest-selling album yet. The first single, \"Already Gone,\" reached the Top 20 the same month. But the most successful song on the LP -- the one that broke them through to a much larger audience -- was \"The Best of My Love,\" which was released as a single in November. It hit number one on the easy listening charts in February 1975 and topped the pop charts a month later. The Eagles\\' fourth album, One of These Nights, was an out-of-the-box smash. Released in June 1975, it went gold the same month and hit number one in July. Moreover, it featured three singles that hit the Top Five: the chart-topping title song, \"Lyin\\' Eyes,\" and \"Take It to the Limit.\" \"Lyin\\' Eyes\" won the 1975 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group, or Chorus, and the Eagles also earned Grammy nominations for Album of the Year (One of These Nights) and Record of the Year (\"Lyin\\' Eyes\"). The group went on a headlining world tour, beginning with the U.S. and expanding into Europe. But on December 20, 1975, it was announced that Bernie Leadon had quit the band, and Joe Walsh (born in Wichita, Kansas, on November 20, 1947) was brought in as his replacement. He immediately joined the tour, which continued to the Far East in early 1976. The Eagles\\' extensive touring kept them out of the studio, and with no immediate plans for a new album; they agreed to release a compilation, Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975), in February 1976. The album\\'s success proved to be surprisingly meteoric. It topped the charts and became a phenomenal success, eventually selling upwards of 25,000,000 copies and dueling with Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller for the title of the best-selling album of all time in the U.S. It took the Eagles 18 months to follow One of These Nights with their fifth album, Hotel California. Released in December 1976, the record was certified platinum in one week, hit number one in January 1977, and eventually sold over 10,000,000 copies. The singles \"New Kid in Town\" and \"Hotel California\" hit number one, and \"Life in the Fast Lane\" made the Top 20. Meanwhile, \"Hotel California\" won the 1977 Grammy for Record of the Year and was nominated for Song of the Year; the album itself was nominated for Album of the Year and for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group, or Chorus. The Eagles embarked on a world tour in March 1977 that began with a month in the U.S., followed by a month in Europe and the Far East, then returned to the U.S. in May for stadium dates. At the end of the tour in September, Randy Meisner left the band; he was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit (born in Sacramento, California, November 20, 1947), formerly of Poco, in which he had also replaced Meisner. (Randy Meisner died on July 26, 2023 at the age of 77.) The Eagles began working on a new album in March 1978 and took nearly a year and a half to complete it. The Long Run was released in September 1979. It hit number one and was certified platinum after four months, eventually earning multi-platinum certifications. \"Heartache Tonight,\" its leadoff single, hit number one, and \"I Can\\'t Tell You Why\" and \"The Long Run\" became Top Ten hits. \"Heartache Tonight\" won the 1979 Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The Eagles toured the U.S. in 1980, and at a week-long series of shows at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, they recorded Eagles Live. (Also included were some tracks recorded in 1976.) Released in November 1980, the double LP (since reissued as a single CD) reached the Top Five and went multi-platinum, with the single \"Seven Bridges Road\" reaching the Top 40. The Eagles were inactive after the end of their 1980 tour, but their breakup was not officially announced until May 1982. All five released solo recordings. (Walsh, of course, maintained a solo career before, during, and after the Eagles.) During the rest of the \\'80s, the bandmembers received several lucrative offers to reunite, but they declined. In 1990, Frey and Henley began writing together again, and they performed along with Schmit and Walsh at benefit concerts that spring. A full-scale reunion was rumored, but did not take place. Four years later, however, the Eagles did reunite. In the spring of 1994, they taped an MTV concert special and then launched a tour that ended up running through August 1996. The MTV show aired in October, followed in November by an audio version of it, the album Hell Freezes Over, which topped the charts and became a multi-million seller, spawning the Top 40 pop hit \"Get Over It\" and the number one adult contemporary hit \"Love Will Keep Us Alive.\" The Eagles next appeared together in January 1998 for their induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, when the five present members performed alongside past members Leadon and Meisner. On December 31, 1999, they played a millennium concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles that was recorded and included on the box set retrospective Selected Works: 1972-1999 in November 2000. All was not well within the band, however, and Felder was expelled from the lineup in February 2001. A protracted legal battle ensued as the Eagles soldiered on as a quartet, releasing The Very Best of the Eagles in 2003 and achieving minor success with the single \"Hole in the World.\" Felder\\'s case was settled out of court in 2007; that same year, the Eagles returned with the band\\'s seventh studio album, Long Road Out of Eden, a double-disc album that quickly went multi-platinum. In 2013, the band made the documentary History of the Eagles, and toured behind it until mid-2015. Six months later, Glenn Frey became ill and passed away on January 18, 2016. He was 67. Just over a year after Frey\\'s death, the Eagles were revived with Glenn\\'s son Deacon taking his place; Vince Gill also joined on guitars and vocals. The group played the Classic West and Classic East festivals in July of 2017, then set out on the road in 2018. At the end of the year, the group\\'s entire discography was boxed up as the Legacy set. ~ William Ruhlmann, Rovi'\n",

      "\"If John Lennon had only been one of the four members of the Beatles, his artistic immortality would already have been assured. The so-called 'smart Beatle,' he brought a penetrating intelligence and a stinging wit both to the band's music and its self-presentation. But in such songs as 'Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)', 'Rain' and 'In My Life', he also marshaled gorgeous melodies to evoke a sophisticated, dreamlike world-weariness well beyond his years. Such work suggested not merely a profound musical and literary sensibility – a genius, in short — but a vision of life that was simultaneously reflective, utopian and poignantly realistic.But it was only after his marriage to artist Yoko Ono in 1969 that the figure the world now recognizes as 'John Lennon' truly came into being. Whether he was engaging in social activism - giving long, passionate interviews that once again broadened the nature of public discourse for artists, defining a new life as a self-described 'househusband' or writing and recording songs, Lennon came to view his life as a work of art in which every act shimmered with potential meaning for the world at large. ★ 7 GRAMMYs ★ 21 NME Awards ★ 15 Ivor Novello Awards ★ 5 Brit Awards ★ 1 Oscar ★★ Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ★ Songwriters Hall of Fame ★ Hollywood Walk of Fame ★\"\n",

      "'R.E.M. marked the point when post-punk turned into alternative rock. When their first single, \"Radio Free Europe,\" was released in 1981, it sparked a back-to-the-garage movement in the American underground. While there were a number of hardcore and punk bands in the U.S. during the early \\'80s, R.E.M. brought guitar pop back into the underground lexicon. Combining ringing guitar hooks with mumbled, cryptic lyrics and a D.I.Y. aesthetic borrowed from post-punk, the band simultaneously sounded traditional and modern. Though there were no overt innovations in their music, R.E.M. had an identity and sense of purpose that transformed the American underground. Throughout the \\'80s, they worked relentlessly, releasing records every year and touring constantly, playing both theaters and backwoods dives. Along the way, they inspired countless bands, from the legions of jangle pop groups in the mid-\\'80s to scores of alternative pop groups in the \\'90s, who admired their slow climb to stardom.It did take R.E.M. several years to break into the top of the charts, but they gained a cult following after the release of their debut EP, Chronic Town, in 1982. Chronic Town established the haunting folk and garage rock that became the band\\'s signature sound, and over the next five years, they continued to expand their music with a series of critically acclaimed albums. By the late \\'80s, the group\\'s fan base had grown large enough to guarantee strong sales, but the Top Ten success in 1987 of Document and \"The One I Love\" was unexpected, especially since R.E.M. had only altered their sound slightly. Following Document, R.E.M. slowly became one of the world\\'s most popular bands. After an exhaustive international tour supporting 1988\\'s Green, the band retired from touring for six years and retreated into the studio to produce their most popular records, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992). By the time they returned to performing with the Monster tour in 1995, the band had been acknowledged by critics and musicians as one of the forefathers of the thriving alternative rock movement, and they were rewarded with the most lucrative tour of their career. Toward the late \\'90s, R.E.M. were an institution, as their influence was felt in new generations of bands. Though R.E.M. formed in Athens, Georgia in 1980, Mike Mills (born December 17, 1958) and Bill Berry (born July 31, 1958) were the only Southerners in the group. Both had attended high school together in Macon, playing in a number of bands during their teens. Michael Stipe (born January 4, 1960) was a military brat, moving throughout the country during his childhood. By his teens, he had discovered punk rock through Patti Smith, Television, and Wire, and began playing in cover bands in St. Louis. By 1978, he had begun studying art at the University of Georgia in Athens, where he began frequenting the Wuxtry record store. Peter Buck (born December 6, 1956), a native of California, was a clerk at Wuxtry. Buck had been a fanatical record collector, consuming everything from classic rock to punk and free jazz, and was just beginning to learn how to play guitar. Discovering they had similar tastes, Buck and Stipe began working together, eventually meeting Berry and Mills through a mutual friend. In April of 1980, the band formed to play a party for their friend, rehearsing a number of garage, psychedelic bubblegum, and punk covers in a converted Episcopalian church. At the time, the group played under the name the Twisted Kites. By the summer, the band had settled on the name R.E.M. after flipping randomly through the dictionary, and had met Jefferson Holt, who became their manager after witnessing the group\\'s first out-of-state concert in North Carolina.Over the next year-and-a-half, R.E.M. toured throughout the South, playing a variety of garage rock covers and folk-rock originals. At the time, the bandmembers were still learning how to play, as Buck began to develop his distinctive, arpeggiated jangle and Stipe ironed out his cryptic lyrics. During the summer of 1981, R.E.M. recorded their first single, \"Radio Free Europe,\" at Mitch Easter\\'s Drive-In Studios. Released on the local indie label Hib-Tone, \"Radio Free Europe\" was pressed in a run of only 1,000 copies, but most of those singles fell into the right hands. Due to strong word of mouth, the single became a hit on college radio and topped The Village Voice\\'s year-end poll of Best Independent Singles. The single also earned the attention of larger independent labels, and by the beginning of 1982, the band had signed to I.R.S. Records, releasing the EP Chronic Town in the spring. Like the single, Chronic Town was well-received, paving the way for the group\\'s full-length debut album, 1983\\'s Murmur. With its subdued, haunting atmosphere and understated production, Murmur was noticeably different than Chronic Town and was welcomed with enthusiastic reviews upon its spring release; Rolling Stone named it the best album of 1983, beating out Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller and the Police\\'s Synchronicity. Murmur also expanded the group\\'s cult significantly, breaking into the American Top 40. The band returned to a rougher-edged sound on 1984\\'s Reckoning, which featured the college hit \"So. Central Rain (I\\'m Sorry).\" By the time R.E.M. hit the road to support Reckoning, they had become well known in the American underground for their constant touring, aversion to videos, support of college radio, Stipe\\'s mumbled vocals and detached stage presence, Buck\\'s ringing guitar, and their purposely enigmatic artwork. Bands that imitated these very things ran rampant throughout the American underground, and R.E.M. threw their support toward these bands, having them open at shows and mentioning them in interviews. By 1985, the American underground was awash with R.E.M. soundalikes and bands like Game Theory and the Rain Parade, which shared similar aesthetics and sounds. Just as the signature R.E.M. sound dominated the underground, the band entered darker territory with its third album, 1985\\'s Fables of the Reconstruction. Recorded in London with producer Joe Boyd (Richard Thompson, Fairport Convention, Nick Drake), Fables of the Reconstruction was made at a difficult period in R.E.M.\\'s history, as the band was fraught with tension produced by endless touring. The album reflected the group\\'s dark moods, as well as its obsession with the rural South, and both of these fascinations popped up on the supporting tour. Stipe, whose on-stage behavior was always slightly strange, entered his most bizarre phase, as he put on weight, dyed his hair bleached blonde, and wore countless layers of clothing. None of the new quirks in R.E.M.\\'s persona prevented Fables of the Reconstruction from becoming their most successful album to date, selling nearly 300,000 copies in the U.S. R.E.M. decided to record their next album with Don Gehman, who had previously worked with John Mellencamp. Gehman had the band clean up its sound and Stipe enunciate his vocals, making Lifes Rich Pageant their most accessible record to date. Upon its late summer release in 1986, Lifes Rich Pageant was greeted with the positive reviews that had become customary with each new R.E.M. album, and it outstripped the sales of its predecessor. Several months after Lifes Rich Pageant, the group released the B-sides and rarities collection Dead Letter Office in the spring of 1987.R.E.M. had laid the groundwork for mainstream success, but they had never explicitly courted widespread fame. Nevertheless, their audience had grown quite large, and it wasn\\'t that surprising that the group\\'s fifth album, Document, became a hit shortly after its fall 1987 release. Produced by Scott Litt -- who would produce all of their records over the course of the next decade -- Document climbed into the U.S. Top Ten and went platinum on the strength of the single \"The One I Love,\" which also went into the Top Ten; it also became their biggest U.K. hit to date, reaching the British Top 40. The following year, the band left I.R.S. Records, signing with Warner Bros. for a reported six million dollars. The first album under the new contract was Green, which was released on U.S. Election Day 1988. Green continued the success of Document, going double platinum and generating the Top Ten single \"Stand.\" R.E.M. supported Green with an exhaustive international tour, in which they played their first stadium dates in the U.S. Though they had graduated to stadiums in America, they continued to play clubs throughout Europe. The Green tour proved to be draining for the group, and they took an extended rest upon its completion in 1989. During the break, each member pursued side projects, and Hindu Love Gods, an album Buck, Berry, and Mills recorded with Warren Zevon in 1986, was released. R.E.M. reconvened during 1990 to record their seventh album, Out of Time, which was released in the spring of 1991. Entering the U.S. and U.K. charts at number one, Out of Time was a lush pop and folk album, boasting a wider array of sounds than the group\\'s previous efforts; its lead single, \"Losing My Religion,\" became the group\\'s biggest single, reaching number four in the U.S. Since the bandmembers were exhausted from the Green tour, they chose to stay off the road. Nevertheless, Out of Time became the group\\'s biggest album, selling over four million copies in the U.S. and spending two weeks at the top of the charts. R.E.M. released the dark, meditative Automatic for the People in the fall of 1992. Though the band had promised a rock album after the softer textures of Out of Time, Automatic for the People was slow, quiet, and reflective, with many songs being graced by string arrangements by Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Like its predecessor, Automatic for the People was a quadruple platinum success, generating the Top 40 hit singles \"Drive,\" \"Man on the Moon,\" and \"Everybody Hurts.\"After piecing together two albums in the studio, R.E.M. decided to return to being a rock band with 1994\\'s Monster. Though the record was conceived as a back-to-basics album, the recording of Monster was difficult and plagued with tension. Nevertheless, the album was a huge hit upon its fall release, entering the U.S. and U.K. charts at number one; furthermore, the album received accolades from a number of old-school critics who had been reluctant to praise the band, since they didn\\'t \"rock\" in conventional terms. Experiencing some of the strongest sales and reviews of their career, R.E.M. began their first tour since Green early in 1995. Two months into the tour, Bill Berry suffered a brain aneurysm while performing; he had surgery immediately and had fully recovered within a month. R.E.M. resumed their tour two months after Berry\\'s aneurysm, but his illness was only the beginning of a series of problems that plagued the Monster tour. Mills had to undergo abdominal surgery to remove an intestinal tumor in July; a month later, Stipe had to have an emergency surgery for a hernia. Despite all the problems, the tour was an enormous financial success, and the group recorded the bulk of a new album. Before the record was released in the fall of 1996, R.E.M. parted ways with their longtime manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him; the group\\'s lawyer, Bertis Downs, assumed managerial duties. New Adventures in Hi-Fi was released in September 1996, just before it was announced that the band had re-signed with Warner Bros., reportedly for a record-breaking sum of 80 million dollars. In light of such a huge figure, the commercial failure of New Adventures in Hi-Fi was ironic. Though it received strong reviews and debuted at number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K., the album failed to generate a hit single, and it only went platinum where its three predecessors went quadruple platinum. By early 1997, the album had already begun its descent down the charts. However, the members of R.E.M. were already pursuing new projects, as Stipe worked with his film company, Single Cell Pictures, and Buck co-wrote songs with Mark Eitzel and worked with a free jazz group, Tuatara. In October of 1997, R.E.M. shocked fans and the media with the announcement that Berry was amicably exiting the group to retire to life on his farm; the remaining members continued on as a three-piece, soon convening in Hawaii to begin preliminary work on their next LP. Replacing Berry with a drum machine, the sessions resulted in 1998\\'s Up, widely touted as the band\\'s most experimental recording in years. It was only a brief change of direction, since R.E.M.\\'s next album, 2001\\'s Reveal, marked a return to their classic sound. Around the Sun followed in 2004. A worldwide tour convened in 2005, which included an appearance at the London branch of Live 8. In 2007, R.E.M. were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and began work on their next album, Accelerate, which was released in 2008. The album sported a faster, more guitar-driven sound than Around the Sun, which had received lukewarm reviews and sold poorly, particularly in America. It earned rave reviews and topped charts around the world (although it halted at number two in America). For 2011\\'s Collapse Into Now, the band favored a more expansive sound, one that combined Accelerate\\'s rock songs with slower ballads and moody atmospherics. Reviews were mostly positive, and it debuted in the Top Five in America. Unexpectedly, in September 2011, R.E.M. announced their amicable breakup after 31 years together. Immediately after the split, the band issued a double-disc compilation entitled Part Lies Part Heart Part Truth Part Garbage: 1982-2011, covering their years at both I.R.S. and Warner. In 2015 the band signed a deal with Concord Bicycle to distribute their Warner recordings, and the first fruits of this partnership surfaced in 2016, when a 25th Anniversary Edition of Out of Time appeared in November of that year. The next installment in this reissue campaign was a 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of Automatic for the People in November 2017. A year later, the group released R.E.M. at the BBC, a box set containing eight CDs and a DVD chronicling all their live work for the British Broadcasting Company. A 25th Anniversary edition of Monster appeared in 2019. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Over the course of his career, Rod Stewart has been lauded as the finest singer of his generation; he\\'s written several songs that turned into modern standards; he\\'s sung with the Faces, who rivaled the Rolling Stones in their prime; and he\\'s had massive commercial success. He\\'s one of rock &amp; roll\\'s best interpretive singers as well as an accomplished, innovative songwriter whose work created a raw, loose, and charming combination of folk, rock, blues, and country. After Stewart became successful, he began to lose the rootsier elements of his music, adapting his style to suit the times, leading to smash hits in the disco, new wave, and MTV eras. Stewart eased into his status as a veteran singer by releasing a series of albums where he crooned The Great American Songbook, but he returned to original material with 2013\\'s Time. The record opened up another act for the rocker, one where he wrote new songs that slyly incorporated modern sounds, a combination that informed such albums as 2021\\'s The Tears of Hercules.Stewart began his musical career after spending some time as an apprentice with the Brentford Football Club, touring Europe with folk singer Wizz Jones in the early \\'60s; during this time he was deported from Spain for vagrancy. When he returned to England in 1963, he joined the Birmingham-based R&amp;B group Jimmy Powell &amp; the Five Dimensions as a vocalist and harmonica player. The band toured the U.K. and recorded one single for Pye Records that featured Stewart on blues harp. After moving back to London, he joined Long John Baldry\\'s band, the Hoochie Coochie Men. The group recorded a single in 1964, \"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,\" that failed to chart, and soon afterward the band evolved into Steampacket. During the summer of 1965, the group supported the Rolling Stones and the Walker Brothers on a U.K. tour and recorded an album that remained unreleased until 1970. Early in 1966, Steampacket disbanded and Stewart became a member of the blues-rock combo Shotgun Express, which released one single that fall before splitting. Stewart then joined the Jeff Beck Group at the end of 1966. With the Jeff Beck Group, Stewart began his climb to stardom. He and the former Yardbird guitarist pioneered the heavy blues-rock team of a virtuoso guitarist and a dynamic, sexy lead vocalist that became the standard blueprint for heavy metal. Truth, the band\\'s debut album, was released in the fall of 1968, and became a hit in both America and Britain. The Jeff Beck Group toured both countries several times in 1968 and 1969, gaining a dedicated following. In the summer of 1969, they released their second album, Beck-Ola, which became another hit record in both the U.S. and U.K. However, the group fell apart in the fall.After rejecting an offer to join the American rock group Cactus, Stewart and Jeff Beck Group bassist Ron Wood joined the Small Faces, replacing the departed vocalist/guitarist Steve Marriott. With Wood switching over to guitar, the group shortened its name to the Faces and recorded its debut album, First Step. During this time, Stewart had also signed a solo contract, releasing his first album, An Old Raincoat Won\\'t Ever Let You Down (retitled The Rod Stewart Album for its American release), at the end of 1969; the record failed to chart in the U.K., yet it made it to number 139 on the U.S. charts. On the album, Stewart\\'s folk roots meshed with his R&amp;B and rock influences, creating a distinctive, stripped-down acoustic-based rock &amp; roll that signaled he was a creative force in his own right.The Faces released First Step in the spring of 1970. The album was a departure both from the R&amp;B/pop direction of the Small Faces and the heavy blues of the Jeff Beck Group; instead, the group became a boisterous, boozy, and sloppy Stones-inspired rock &amp; roll band. The album fared better in the U.K. than it did in the U.S., yet the group built a devoted following on both continents with their reckless, messy live shows. Stewart released his second solo album, Gasoline Alley, in the fall of 1970, supporting it with an American tour.The following year proved to be pivotal in Stewart\\'s career. At the beginning of 1971, the Faces released their second album, Long Player, which became a bigger hit than First Step, yet his third solo album, Every Picture Tells a Story, made Rod Stewart a household name, reaching number one in both America and Britain. \"Reason to Believe\" was the first single from the album, becoming a minor hit in both countries, but when DJs began playing the B-side, \"Maggie May,\" it became a number one hit in both the U.K. and U.S. for five weeks in September. The Faces released their third album, A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...To a Blind Horse, a couple of months later. Thanks to the success of Every Picture Tells a Story, the album was a Top Ten hit in both countries; it also launched the single \"Stay with Me,\" which became the band\\'s only Top 40 hit in the U.S.The following year, the Faces began a lengthy spring tour. During the tour, tensions grew within the band as Stewart\\'s solo career increased his popularity. That summer, Stewart released his fourth solo album, Never a Dull Moment, which nearly replicated the success of Every Picture Tells a Story, peaking at number two in the U.S. and number one in the U.K. In the spring of 1973, the Faces released their final album, Ooh La La. Stewart expressed his disdain for the record in the press, yet it hit number one in the U.K. and number 21 in the U.S. After releasing the \"Pool Hall Richard\" single in the beginning of 1974, the band went on tour; it would prove to be their last. Stewart released Smiler in the fall of 1975. Smiler followed the same formula as his previous four albums -- and it also became a hit -- yet it showed signs that the formula was wearing thin. In March of 1975, he began a love affair with Swedish actress Britt Ekland; the romance, along with a bitter fight with U.K. tax collectors, prompted him to apply for U.S. citizenship. Atlantic Crossing, released in the summer of 1975, made the singer\\'s relocation explicit. Recorded with producer Tom Dowd and the Muscle Shoals rhythm section, the album removed much of the singer\\'s folk roots and accentuated his pop appeal. At the end of the year, Stewart left the Faces and the band finally called it quits.Recorded in Los Angeles with a group of studio musicians, 1976\\'s A Night on the Town continued Stewart\\'s move to slicker pop territory and proved quite successful, becoming his first platinum album; it featured the hit single \"Tonight\\'s the Night,\" which was number one in the U.S. for eight weeks. Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free, released the following year, followed the same artistic pattern as A Night on the Town while surpassing its commercial performance, selling over three million copies. Stewart incorporated some disco to his musical formula for 1978\\'s Blondes Have More Fun. Supported by the number one single \"Da Ya Think I\\'m Sexy?,\" the record became Stewart\\'s first number one album since Every Picture Tells a Story, selling over four million records. By this time, Stewart was notorious for his jet-set lifestyle, particularly the series of actresses and models he dated.With 1981\\'s Tonight I\\'m Yours, Stewart began adding elements of new wave and synth pop to his formula, resulting in another platinum album. Soon afterward, his career hit a slump. His next four albums sounded forced and he only scored three Top Ten hits between 1982 and 1988; out of those four albums, only 1983\\'s Camouflage went gold. Stewart rebounded with 1988\\'s Out of Order, recorded with Duran Duran\\'s Andy Taylor and Chic\\'s Bernard Edwards. His version of Tom Waits\\' \"Downtown Train,\" taken from the 1989 four-disc box set Storyteller, became his biggest hit since \"Da Ya Think I\\'m Sexy?\" Vagabond Heart (1991) reflected a more mature and reflective Rod Stewart and continued his comeback streak.Stewart reunited with Ron Wood to record an MTV Unplugged concert in 1993; the accompanying album, Unplugged...And Seated, launched the Top Ten hit single \"Have I Told You Lately.\" Unplugged also returned Stewart to a more acoustic-based sound. On his 1995 album A Spanner in the Works, the singer explored a more polished version of this sound, scoring another hit with Tom Petty\\'s \"Leave Virginia Alone.\" The following year, he released If We Fall in Love Tonight, which was comprised of both previously released and new material. When We Were the New Boys, a return to his roots in trad rock, followed in 1998.In 2001, Stewart embarked on a new path with Human, an album that attempted to cross over to contemporary and urban audiences, but it failed with the critical and commercial public alike. His next project may have sounded equally unlikely, but it was much more successful. It Had to Be You, the first in his series crooning the Great American Songbook, became an adult contemporary favorite and lodged near the top of the album charts after its release in 2002. As Time Goes By followed it into the charts in 2003 and missed the top spot by only one notch. In late 2004, his third volume in the series (Stardust) hit number one. Thanks for the Memory became the fourth entry in the series in 2005. By the year\\'s end, all four volumes were collected in The Great American Songbook Box Set. In 2006, he continued his series of cover albums, but this time he focused on the rock &amp; roll era. Still the Same: Great Rock Classics of Our Time appeared toward the end of the year, with a version of Creedence Clearwater Revival\\'s \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\" as its lead single. Stewart next tackled soul and Motown classics with 2009\\'s Soulbook but returned to standards for 2010\\'s fifth installment of his Great American Songbook series, Fly Me to the Moon. Stewart continued to flirt with the idea of a Faces reunion throughout this period, but even when the group was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in the spring of 2012, he stayed on the sidelines. Instead, Stewart prepped his first album for Verve: the seasonal set Merry Christmas, Baby, which appeared in October of 2012, the same month he published his memoir Rod: The Autobiography. Authoring his memoir inspired Stewart to return to songwriting, a discipline he had left behind in the \\'90s. His next album, Time -- his first for Capitol Records -- almost entirely comprised songs he had co-written, and they all had a distinctly autobiographical bent. Time was released in May of 2013. Following its success, Stewart returned to the studio to record another collection of original material. Another Country appeared in October 2015, and featured the single \"Love Is.\" In 2017, he collaborated on a remix of his song \"Da Ya Think I\\'m Sexy?\" with Joe Jonas\\' DNCE. Stewart\\'s next full-length album, Blood Red Roses, appeared in September 2018. Blood Red Roses debuted at number one in the U.K., where it was also certified Gold. In 2019, Stewart released You\\'re in My Heart, an album that contained original vocal tracks overdubbed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. The Tears of Hercules, his next album of original material, arrived in November 2021. Like its three predecessors, it was co-produced and often co-written with Kevin Savigar. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Qawwali, the mystical music of Indian and Pakistani Sufism, is rooted in song forms that are over 700 years old. Qawwali songs are devotional songs that extol Islamic virtues and shower praise upon Allah. Qawwali is intended to affect heightened spirituality through ritualized listening known as Sama. The transcendent nature of the poetic lyrics, in combination with a vivacious musical base and the participatory act of Sama, stirs ecstatic feelings of mystical adoration among both performers and audience members alike. Undoubtedly the most popular qawwali singer of all time was the Pakistani-born Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Six weeks after his death in 1997, nephew Rahat Fateh Ali Khan assumed the qawwali helm. Rahat took Nusrat\\'s first name in a traditional gesture of admiration of his master, and in so doing was officially recognized as the new leader of Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\\'s group. Born in Faisalabad, Pakistan, Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was selected at birth by his uncle for tutoring in the art of qawwali music. A precocious child, Rahat was singing at the age of three with his uncle and his father Farroukh Fateh Ali Khan, another respected qawwali singer. Rahat began formalized training with his uncle at the age of six. By age 15, Rahat officially joined his uncle\\'s celebrated group.Since becoming the head of the group, Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan has performed on a variety of recordings and has sung with Eddie Vedder at the Dead Man Walking Concert put on by Tim Robbins. He and his band continue to entrance world audiences with numerous shows around the globe. Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\\'s self-titled release on American Recordings is his U.S. debut. Recorded in Santa Monica, CA, its four tracks are both emotionally charged and expertly performed. Producer Rick Rubin, of Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Beastie Boys fame, boosts Rahat\\'s already potent sounds by cranking up the low end and placing the tabla way up in the mix.Though Rahat is excited to play with Western pop musicians and lay down tracks in state-of-the-art studios, he is ultimately most concerned with the art of qawwali and its mystically imbued message. As he states, \"qawwali music is not only music, it is a message. It was created by Sufis, and when we compose and practice this music, it stays forever. Other music comes and goes, but qawwali never goes. Once you start listening, it goes in your soul, goes in your spirit, and you become more human. I feel that this music is my duty, to go and give the message of Sufism. My future is that one day I will fulfill the desire of Nusrat to give this message to the world.\" ~ John Vallier'\n",

      "'With their unlikely but fascinating mix of arty concepts and raw sounds, the White Stripes were among the leaders of the early-2000s garage rock revival and helped define the sound of 21st century rock as the decade progressed. Jack and Meg White\\'s clever use of limitations -- from their lineup to their instrumentation to their red, white, and black color scheme -- maximized their creativity, allowing them to bring a surprising number of facets to their seemingly back-to-basics approach. Meg\\'s straight-ahead, minimalist drumming complemented Jack\\'s freewheeling guitars and vocals perfectly, and their music touched on not only on obvious forebears such as the Gories and the Stooges, but also Son House and Blind Willie McTell\\'s mythic blues, Led Zeppelin\\'s riffs, the Gun Club\\'s unhinged punk, and the timeless storytelling of country and folk legends such as Loretta Lynn and Bob Dylan. The breadth of their sound and their fondness for mystique -- they said the Dutch design movement De Stijl was as an important an influence on them as any musician, and claimed to be siblings even though they were actually a married couple until 2000 -- gave the White Stripes more staying power than many of their contemporaries. As they grew from a pair of Detroit kids on 1999\\'s The White Stripes to international rock stars responsible for a trio of Grammy-winning albums (2003\\'s Elephant, 2005\\'s Get Behind Me Satan, and 2007\\'s Icky Thump), they always remained true to their ideals. Born and raised in Detroit, Jack White -- then known as Jack Gillis -- began playing drums as a child and picked up guitar in high school. When he was a senior, he met Meg White at the restaurant where she worked, and the pair struck up a friendship. While running his upholstery business, Gillis also played drums for bands such as the country outfit Goober &amp; the Peas, the Go, and the Hentchmen. He and White married in 1996, with Jack taking Meg\\'s surname. The couple became a band in 1997 when they jammed that Bastille Day with Jack on guitar and vocals and Meg on drums. Naming themselves after Meg\\'s love of peppermints, they made their live debut in August 1997 at the Gold Dollar bar, joining an underground garage rock scene that also included the Gories and the Dirtbombs. The band soon connected with Dave Buick, owner of the Detroit garage rock label Italy Records, who released the White Stripes\\' first single \"Let\\'s Shake Hands\" in February 1998 as a seven-inch with an initial run of 1,000 copies. That October, the single \"Lafayette Blues\" followed, and tours with Pavement and Sleater-Kinney helped the duo earn a national following. After signing to Sympathy for the Record Industry, the band released the single \"The Big Three Killed My Baby\" in March 1999. Recorded at Jim Diamond\\'s Ghetto Recorders studio in Detroit and produced by Jack White, the White Stripes\\' self-titled debut album appeared that June and was dedicated to blues icon Son House. The album made a fan of legendary BBC DJ John Peel, whose support helped the band gain fans in the U.K. The duo closed the year by releasing \"Hand Springs,\" a split single with the Dirtbombs that came with the pinball fanzine Multiball. For their raw second album, 2000\\'s De Stijl, the White Stripes recorded themselves on an 8-track in Jack\\'s living room. Taking the album\\'s name from the early 20th century Dutch aesthetic movement, the band dedicated De Stijl to the style\\'s founder, designer Gerrit Rietveld, and Blind Willie McTell. Late that year, the White Stripes released Party of Special Things to Do, a Sub Pop single featuring three Captain Beefheart covers. It was with their next album, 2001\\'s White Blood Cells, that the White Stripes established themselves as leaders of the garage rock revival. Recorded in Memphis with renowned producer Doug Easley, it marked the first time the band had worked in a 24-track studio (as well as their first album to be mastered in the studio), but it was recorded in just four days to avoid sounding too polished. Featuring the single \"Fell in Love with a Girl\" -- which boasted a clever, Lego-animated video by Michel Gondry that won the 2002 MTV Video Awards for Breakthrough Video, Best Special Effects, and Best Editing -- White Blood Cells was a critical and commercial smash. The album eventually went platinum, and the White Stripes appeared on Late Night with David Letterman and the MTV Movie Awards program; meanwhile, their music was profiled in Time, The New Yorker, and Entertainment Weekly. That year, Jack White also founded his own label, Third Man Records, whose name paid homage to the classic Orson Welles film as well as White\\'s upholstery business. To accommodate their swell in popularity, the White Stripes moved to a major label. After signing to V2, the label reissued White Blood Cells in January 2002, and the previous two records in June. To make their fourth album, the band decamped to London to work at engineer Liam Watson\\'s Toe Rag Studios, choosing it for its wealth of vintage analog equipment. Recorded in less than two weeks, 2003\\'s Elephant explored \"the death of the sweetheart\" and received unanimous critical acclaim and platinum sales in several countries upon its release. The album won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album, while its lead single, \"Seven Nation Army,\" won the Grammy for Best Rock song (and later became an internationally popular jock jam at sporting events). Also in 2003, Jack White made his film debut in Anthony Minghella\\'s Cold Mountain and performed five songs on its T-Bone Burnett-produced soundtrack.While many garage rock revivalists fell by the wayside as the 2000s continued, the White Stripes proved to be an enduring presence. On 2005\\'s dizzyingly diverse Get Behind Me Satan -- which, in keeping with the band\\'s feverish pace, they wrote and recorded in two weeks -- they experimented with disco-metal and marimba-driven pop. Like its predecessor, it won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album. During the Get Behind Me Satan tour, the Stripes covered Tegan and Sara\\'s \"Walking with a Ghost\" and released the song as a single at the end of 2005. That year, Jack White and his second wife, singer/model Karen Elson, moved to Nashville, Tennessee. After relocating, White formed the Raconteurs with Brendan Benson and the Greenhornes\\' Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler, and spent much of 2006 touring in support of the group\\'s debut album, Broken Boy Soldiers. Jack White continued to juggle his responsibilities as he performed with several bands, produced albums for other artists, and made forays into cinema. However, the White Stripes remained a vital commercial and critical presence. Early in 2007, the band moved to Warner Bros., which released their sixth and final album, Icky Thump, that June. Recorded at Nashville\\'s Blackbird Studio over the course of three weeks -- the longest sessions of the band\\'s career -- the album also included the first-ever Stripes songs with bagpipes and mariachi horns. Upon its release, Icky Thump topped the U.K. Albums Chart; in the U.S., it entered the Billboard 200 at number two and was certified gold by July 2007. After finishing a cross-country tour of Canada, the band played a handful of U.S. shows before canceling all future tour dates that September due to Meg White\\'s anxiety issues. Early the following year, Icky Thump won the Best Alternative Album at the 2008 Grammy Awards, while the title track scored the award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. In February 2009, Jack and Meg reunited for their final live performance as the White Stripes on the last episode of Late Night with Conan O\\'Brien.During this time, Jack White remained busy with several projects. These included the Raconteurs\\' 2008 second album Consolers of the Lonely and establishing Third Man Records\\' first physical location in Nashville, which included the label\\'s offices, a record store, a performance area and screening room. At the site\\'s launch in March 2009, White debuted another band, the Dead Weather. Featuring the Kills\\' Alison Mosshart, Queens of the Stone Age guitarist Dean Fertita, and his Raconteurs bandmate Lawrence, the band\\'s debut album Horehound appeared a few months later. That year, he appeared in the guitar-themed documentary It Might Get Loud, and produced Elson\\'s album The Ghost Who Walks. Under Great White Northern Lights, a film documenting the band\\'s 2007 Canadian tour, premiered at the 2009 Toronto Film Festival. The DVD of the film and a companion album of the same name were issued in 2010, while the duo\\'s first three albums were reissued on vinyl by Third Man Records that year. In February 2011, Jack and Meg White officially announced they would no longer record or perform as the White Stripes. The following year, Jack White began his solo career with his debut album, Blunderbuss. In 2015, he brought Third Man Records back to where it all began, establishing a Detroit location that included a vinyl pressing plant as well as a record store and venue. During the 2010s, Third Man released reissues of the White Stripes\\' albums and singles, as well as archival releases such as 2017\\'s Complete John Peel Sessions. In December 2020, The White Stripes Greatest Hits became the band\\'s first best-of collection. The compilation was also released as part of Third Man Records\\' subscription program with different artwork and a collection of B-sides. ~ Andrew Leahey &amp; Heather Phares, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Dido Armstrong is the former backing singer (with her brother Rollo's band Faithless) who emerged from the shadows to make two of the best-selling albums in British chart history. Dido's titanic success swept her away. Released in 1998, No Angel's success was slow burning, growing and growing to eventually become the bestselling album of 2001. All that time Dido was on the road, through the phenomenal Life For Rent in 2003, all the way to performing to a TV audience of billions at Live8 in 2005. Having toured for nine years straight, she then decided to stop. It was time for Dido to catch up with her own life. Safe Trip Home was released in 2008, with a more acoustic and orchestral ambience. She got married in 2008 and a son, Stanley, was born in 2011. Dido went on to release one more album, Girl Who Got Away, in 2013, but once again opted not to take it on the road. And now she's back with her fifth album, Still On My Mind. Released in March 2019, the album wafts in like a beautiful breeze, a chilled out tumble of sadness and joy, melancholy and bliss. Still On My Mind is only Dido's fifth album in 20 years. And it is right up there with her best work. Dido also announced that she would tour for the first time in 15 years. “I love this album,” she says. “It's been an absolutely magical experience making it. And I want people to hear it. So I think it's time to go out there again.”\"\n",

      "'At his peak, Eric Clapton was nicknamed \"God\" by his fans, an indication of how highly regarded the guitarist was during his glory days. This phrase, immortalized in graffiti that spread across London in 1967, originated a few years earlier when Clapton was playing with John Mayall\\'s Bluesbreakers just after leaving the Yardbirds in 1965. Clapton never was comfortable with the nickname -- he embraced \"Slowhand,\" titling his 1977 album after it -- but \"Clapton Is God\" is a pivotal part of his story and an instrumental moment in the rise of the guitar hero, a rock &amp; roll cliché that didn\\'t exist prior to EC. To be sure, there were flashy players in blues and rock prior to Clapton, but nothing along the lines of Clapton, whose fame quickly eclipsed Mayall\\'s in the Bluesbreakers and whose playing became the centerpiece of Cream, the psychedelic power trio he co-led with bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker between 1966 and 1968. Clapton was venerated for his fast-fingered solos (the \"Slowhand\" nickname was in jest) and that\\'s what people came to see. Although he sang some Cream songs, it took him a while before he embraced lead vocals, easing into a solo career after a stint with Delaney &amp; Bonnie in 1969 and 1970. Clapton was so reticent to step to the front of the stage that he adopted a pseudonym for what\\'s regarded as his finest album, Layla &amp; Other Assorted Love Songs by Derek &amp; the Dominos, but after a bout with addiction that sidelined him through much of the early \\'70s, he re-emerged as the pre-eminent guitarist of his generation, a sword-slinger who undercut his bravado with pretty ballads, like \"Wonderful Tonight.\" The \\'80s may not have treated Clapton kindly -- he teamed with Phil Collins for albums designed to bring him hits that never materialized -- but he reigned in the \\'90s, benefitting from the acoustic authenticity of 1993\\'s Unplugged, which turned into one of his biggest records. After that LP, he went out of his way to boost his idols -- he cut full albums with J.J. Cale and B.B. King -- while occasionally taking an odd stylistic departure (his odd TDF side project with Simon Climie) but always reconnecting with the blues roots upon which his entire career lay, as evidenced by his relaxed 2021 album The Lady in the Balcony: Lockdown Sessions.By the time Eric Clapton launched his solo career with the release of his self-titled debut album in mid-1970, he was long established as one of the world\\'s major rock stars due to his group affiliations -- the Yardbirds, John Mayall\\'s Bluesbreakers, Cream, Blind Faith -- all of which had demonstrated his claim to being the best rock guitarist of his generation. The fact that it took Clapton so long to go out on his own, however, was evidence of a degree of reticence unusual for someone of his stature. And his debut album, though it spawned the Top 40 hit \"After Midnight,\" was typical of his self-effacing approach: it was, in effect, an album by the group he had lately been featured in, Delaney &amp; Bonnie &amp; Friends.Not surprisingly, before his solo debut had even been released, Clapton had retreated from his solo stance, assembling from the D&amp;B&amp;F ranks the personnel for a group, Derek &amp; the Dominos, with whom he played for most of 1970 and recorded the landmark album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. Clapton was largely inactive in 1971 and 1972, due to heroin addiction, but he performed a comeback concert at the Rainbow Theatre in London on January 13, 1973, resulting in the album Eric Clapton\\'s Rainbow Concert (September 1973). He did not launch a sustained solo career until July 1974, though, when he released 461 Ocean Boulevard, which topped the charts and spawned the number one single \"I Shot the Sheriff.\" The persona Clapton established over the next decade was less that of guitar hero than arena rock star with a weakness for ballads. The follow-ups to 461 Ocean Boulevard -- There\\'s One in Every Crowd (March 1975), the live E.C. Was Here (August 1975), and No Reason to Cry (August 1976) -- were less successful. But Slowhand (November 1977), which featured both the powerful \"Cocaine\" (written by J.J. Cale, who had also written \"After Midnight\") and the hit singles \"Lay Down Sally\" and \"Wonderful Tonight,\" was a million-seller. Its follow-ups, Backless (November 1978), featuring the Top Ten hit \"Promises,\" the live Just One Night (April 1980), and Another Ticket (February 1981), featuring the Top Ten hit \"I Can\\'t Stand It,\" were all big sellers.Clapton\\'s popularity waned somewhat in the first half of the \\'80s, as the albums Money and Cigarettes (February 1983), Behind the Sun (March 1985), and August (November 1986) indicated a certain career stasis. However, he was buoyed up by the release of the box set retrospective Crossroads (April 1988), which seemed to remind his fans of how great he was. Journeyman (November 1989) was a return to form. It would be his last new studio album for nearly five years, though in the interim he would suffer greatly and enjoy surprising triumph. On March 20, 1991, Clapton\\'s four-year-old son was killed in a fall. While he mourned, he released a live album, 24 Nights (October 1991), culled from his annual concert series at Royal Albert Hall in London, and prepared a movie soundtrack, Rush (January 1992). The soundtrack featured a song written for his son, \"Tears in Heaven,\" that became a massive hit single.In March 1992, Clapton recorded a concert for MTV Unplugged that, when released as an album in August, became his biggest-selling record ever. Two years later, he returned with a blues album, From the Cradle, which became one of his most successful releases, both commercially and critically. Crossroads, Vol. 2: Live in the Seventies, a box set chronicling his live work from the \\'70s, was released to mixed reviews. In early 1997, Clapton, billing himself by the pseudonym \"X-Sample,\" collaborated with keyboardist/producer Simon Climie as the ambient new age and trip-hop duo T.D.F. The duo released Retail Therapy to mixed reviews in early 1997. Clapton retained Climie as his collaborator for Pilgrim, his first album of new material since 1989\\'s Journeyman. Pilgrim was greeted with decidedly mixed reviews upon its spring 1998 release, but the album debuted at number four and stayed in the Top Ten for several weeks on the success of the single \"My Father\\'s Eyes.\" In 2000, Clapton teamed up with old friend B.B. King on Riding with the King, a set of blues standards and material from contemporary singer/songwriters. Another solo outing, entitled Reptile, followed in early 2001. Three years later, Clapton issued Me and Mr. Johnson, a collection of tunes honoring the Mississippi-born bluesman Robert Johnson. Released in 2005, Back Home, Clapton\\'s 14th album of original material, reflected his ease with fatherhood. Also in 2005, he unexpectedly teamed with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker for a Cream reunion that included May concerts at London\\'s Royal Albert Hall and shows at New York\\'s Madison Square Garden in October, with the former being compiled for a live release that fall. This turned out to be the first of many reunions and looks back for Clapton. In 2006, he elevated the profile of his latter-day idol J.J. Cale by recording an album-long duet, The Road to Escondido. The following year he released his autobiography -- accompanied by a new career compilation called The Complete Clapton -- which focused more on his trials with addiction and subsequent recovery than his musical career. In 2008, Clapton began playing regular shows with his old Blind Faith partner Steve Winwood, gigs that were captured on the 2009 double-live set Live from Madison Square Garden. In addition, Winwood appeared on Clapton\\'s next studio album, 2010\\'s Clapton, which was a collaboration-heavy affair also featuring Cale, Sheryl Crow, Allen Toussaint, and Wynton Marsalis. In 2011, Clapton returned the favor to Marsalis by collaborating on the live concert album Play the Blues: Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center. Clapton parted ways with Warner after Clapton, and he chose to set up his own Bushbranch imprint on independent label Surfdog. His first album for the label was Old Sock, largely a collection of old songs the guitarist loved. It reached the Top Ten in the U.S. and Great Britain. In the fall of 2013, Warner Bros. released Crossroads Guitar Festival 2013, and his Unplugged album was expanded and remastered by Rhino. Early the following year, Clapton announced that a new album, The Breeze: An Appreciation of J.J. Cale, would be issued in July, one year on from the passing of his key inspiration. The tribute album included contributions from artists such as Willie Nelson, John Mayer, Tom Petty, and Mark Knopfler. A collection of his Warner recordings called Forever Man saw a spring 2015 release. Clapton returned in May 2016 with I Still Do, his third album for Surfdog. It found him reuniting with Slowhand producer Glyn Johns; the set debuted at six on the Billboard Top 200. Later that year, Clapton issued Live in San Diego, a double-disc album featuring a 2007 concert with J.J. Cale. In 2018, he released his first holiday album, Happy Xmas. Clapton next appeared playing and singing on 2020\\'s \"Stand and Deliver,\" an anti-COVID-19 lockdown protest song written by Van Morrison. The pair reunited for \"This Has Gotta Stop,\" another anti-lockdown single, in August 2021. At the end of the year, he released The Lady in the Balcony: Lockdown Sessions, a live-in-the-studio collection of blues standards and old Clapton hits. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Norwegian pop trio a-ha took the world by storm with the upbeat video for their 1985 single \"Take on Me\" off their debut long-player Hunting High and Low. The song and album charted at or near the top across the globe -- its iconic animated video single has been viewed over two billion times. At home, a-ha placed eight consecutive albums at number one and another pair at two. Both 1986\\'s Scoundrel Days and 1988\\'s Stay on These Roads -- which contained \"The Living Daylights,\" the title theme for a James Bond film -- won platinum certification in Europe. Following 1993\\'s Memorial Beach, they went on hiatus then returned with a string of successful albums including 2000\\'s Minor Earth Major Sky, 2005\\'s Analogue, and 2009\\'s Foot of the Mountain, which marked a return to synth pop. They disbanded again in 2010 but reunited for a Brazilian tour in 2015 and went back into the recording studio, issuing Cast in Steel in September. The trio continued working together and issued True North in 2022.Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and Magne Furuholmen, formerly of Bridges, formed Norwegian synth pop group a-ha in 1982. Nimble vocalist Morten Harket joined the duo, and they left for the now \"legendary London flat\" (so called because of its state of disrepair) to make their way in a then-burgeoning music industry filled with new wave pop and synth sounds. By late 1983, based on the strength of a demo version of \"Take on Me,\" they signed to WEA. Their debut single of \"Take on Me\" went through three versions before becoming a hit in the U.K., eventually reaching number two in November 1985. It went one better in the U.S., mainly due to the wide exposure of its stunning video on MTV, which fused animation with real-life action. They returned to the charts with \"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.,\" which became a U.K. number one in early 1986, helping take the album Hunting High and Low to the Top Ten. The song hit the Top 20 in the U.S., where the album reached number 15. With a-ha\\'s debut album mainly consisting of romantic synth pop, the press was quick to dismiss them as a teeny bop sensation; however, there was more than met the ear on first impression in the trio\\'s writing, and a more mature effort, Scoundrel Days, was released in October 1986. More focused and rock-oriented, it had a stronger band feel thanks to its live drumming evident on \"The Swing of Things\" and lead single \"I\\'ve Been Losing You,\" which surprised critics at the time. Further striking imagery accompanied \"Cry Wolf.\" The album landed in the Top 30 in Norway and cracked the top half of the Billboard 200 in the U.S. After a world tour, a-ha provided the theme to the James Bond film The Living Daylights. A remix appeared on their third album, Stay on These Roads, in 1988. In 1990, a-ha were commended by the Everly Brothers for their rendition of \"Crying in the Rain\" from their fourth album, East of the Sun, West of the Moon, which was largely ignored in the U.K. due to a shift in interest toward dance music and the Manchester scene. The year 1993 heralded some much-needed new blood in the U2 terrain of \"Dark Is the Night\" from the Memorial Beach album. Following the unfortunate lack of success of Memorial Beach, Furuholmen retreated into the art world while Waaktaar released the album Mary Is Coming with his new band Savoy. Seven years after the release of Memorial Beach, a-ha issued Minor Earth Major Sky in summer 2000. Released in 2002, Lifelines sold well in Europe and was followed by a lengthy tour, documented on the live album How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head, issued in 2003. A year later, a-ha celebrated their 20th anniversary by releasing Singles 1984-2004, a collection that would put them back in the U.K. Top 20. In July of 2005, the band performed in Berlin as part of the massive worldwide event Live8, and in November they released the album Analogue. It was supported by a worldwide tour that included gigs in Russia and a festival in Chile. In 2009, upon issuing their ninth studio album, Foot of the Mountain, a-ha announced that they would be retiring. However, they returned in 2015 with Cast in Steel, which was followed by a world tour. Coinciding with the 2017 summer solstice, the group headed to the remote island of Giske off of Norway\\'s west coast to record their first-ever acoustic concert for MTV Unplugged. With arrangements by producer Lars Horntveth, the by-then-perennial arena band played a career-spanning set with guests Ian McCulloch (Echo &amp; the Bunnymen), Alison Moyet, Lissie, and Ingrid Helene Håvik (Highasakite) for an audience of only 250. That October, the show was released in seven different versions under the title MTV Unplugged: Summer Solstice, along with an abbreviated, single-disc Acoustic Hits: MTV Unplugged. Summer Solstice debuted at number three on the album chart in Germany, number six in the U.K., and number 11 in their home country, and was followed by another world tour in 2018.'\n",

      "'Alice in Chains both epitomized the solemn, heavy Seattle sound of the 1990s and stood apart from the grunge hordes. What separated Alice in Chains from their alt-rock brethren was how their roots lay in heavy metal, not punk. Guitarist Jerry Cantrell and vocalist Layne Staley both played in metal bands prior to the formation of Alice in Chains in 1987 and they released the band\\'s debut, Facelift, in 1990, well before Nirvana\\'s Nevermind pushed the underground into the mainstream. Despite their connections to metal, Alice in Chains thrived in the glory days of grunge, and it wasn\\'t merely a question of timing, either. The band\\'s sensibility fit into the alternative rock zeitgeist of the early \\'90s. Cantrell\\'s gloomy, minor-key riffs were an ideal match for Staley\\'s tortured lyrics, creating a sound that felt as heavy as their Seattle cohorts but also was slightly slicker and ready for radio. It was versatile, too. After the group scored rock radio and MTV hits with \"Man in the Box\" and \"Would?\" in the early days of grunge, Alice in Chains became one of the first alt-rock bands of the \\'90s to delve into acoustic-based music, scoring hits with the comparatively softer \"No Excuses\" and \"I Stay Away.\" Despite its success, the band was plagued with internal tensions during its commercial peak, much of it stemming from Staley\\'s drug addictions. His abuse slowed the band\\'s upward trajectory in the back half of the \\'90s, a descent culminating in the singer\\'s accidental death in 2002. Four years later, Cantrell, drummer Sean Kinney, and bassist Mike Inez revived Alice in Chains with singer William DuVall, sparking an extended second life of recording and touring that has lasted longer than their original incarnation.The roots of Alice in Chains lay in Sleze, a Seattle-based hair metal band that featured Layne Staley as lead singer. Sleze switched their name to Alice N Chains in 1986, roughly a year prior to Staley\\'s introduction to Cantrell at a party at the rehearsal space called the Music Bank. The pair became friends and Staley invited Cantrell to crash with him at his rented unit at the Music Bank. Shortly afterward, Alice N Chains broke up, as did Cantrell\\'s band, Diamond Lie. Cantrell began auditioning players for a new band, recruiting drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr, but he still needed a vocalist and held out hope for Staley to join. At the time, Staley was singing in a funk band that also happened to need a guitarist, so Cantrell agreed to play on the condition his friend would join the fledgling group. Staley agreed. Not long afterward, the funk band folded and this quartet gelled under the name Alice in Chains.Alice in Chains started to gig regularly in the Seattle area, often sharing bills with Mother Love Bone, earning the attention of promoter Randy Hauser, who bankrolled a demo. Dubbed The Treehouse Tapes, the demo earned the attention of Soundgarden managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who passed it along to Columbia. The label signed Alice in Chains in 1989 and made them a priority, ushering the band into the studio with producer David Jerden, who had recently worked with Jane\\'s Addiction. Early in 1990, the label released the promo-only We Die Young EP with their eye on heavy metal audiences and its title track became a hit on rock radio, setting the stage for the August release of the group\\'s debut, Facelift, which was quickly followed by a tour opening for Iggy Pop. \"Man in the Box\" became the album\\'s second single in January 1991, and once its video entered heavy MTV rotation, Facelift took off. The album entered the Billboard charts in April 1991, Van Halen requested Alice in Chains as a tour opener in August, and in September the album earned its first gold certification; it would later earn two platinum certifications.As Facelift\\'s momentum grew, Alice in Chains kept busy behind the scenes, working on material for a second album and recording an acoustic EP called Sap. One of the first all-acoustic records from an alternative rock band, Sap was released in February 1992. Alice in Chains also filmed a cameo in Singles, Cameron Crowe\\'s romantic comedy celebrating Seattle\\'s vibrant underground scene of the early \\'90s. By the time the film\\'s soundtrack appeared in June 1992, the Seattle scene had exploded nationally thanks to the unexpected success of Nirvana\\'s second album, Nevermind, and Alice in Chains were in the thick of it. \"Would?,\" a menacing grind that doubled as the first single from both the Singles soundtrack and Alice in Chains\\' second album, Dirt, started its climb up Billboard\\'s mainstream rock chart in June 1992, the same month the Singles soundtrack was released. By the point Dirt appeared in stores in September, Alice in Chains had firmly laid stakes in the grunge camp: \"Them Bones,\" the second single pulled from Dirt, became their first song to chart on Billboard\\'s alternative rock chart. Arriving at the peak of 1992\\'s grunge explosion, the dark and gloomy Dirt made Alice in Chains\\' career. By December, the album earned a platinum certification -- it would go platinum once again in 1993 and 1995, with a fourth and final certification arriving in 2000 -- and it stayed on the charts thanks to \"Angry Chair\" and the Top Ten mainstream rock hits \"Rooster\" and \"Down in a Hole.\"Despite their success, Alice in Chains were in turmoil behind the scenes. Mike Starr left the band in January 1993, to be replaced by Mike Inez. The band\\'s initial story was that Starr wasn\\'t ready to gear up for an intense work schedule, but Starr later said he was fired due to drug addiction. The specter of heavy drugs hung over the band, thanks to lyrical allusions on Dirt and rumors alleging that Staley was addicted to heroin. Alice in Chains soldiered forth, releasing two new songs on the soundtrack for the Arnold Schwarzenegger film Last Action Hero (including the radio hit \"What the Hell Have I\") and playing a plum spot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993. Jar of Flies found the band retreating to softer, moody music, and the shift paid off commercially. Upon its January 1994 release, it became the first EP to debut at number one on the Billboard charts and, thanks in part to \"No Excuses\" -- which went to number one on the mainstream rock chart and three on Billboard\\'s alternative chart, the highest placing they\\'d have with Layne Staley in the lineup -- it was certified platinum by March; it would eventually earn two additional certifications. Alice in Chains remained on the top of the charts, but they also remained off the road during 1994, fueling speculation that Staley was mired in heroin addiction. The rumors were true. Behind the scenes, Staley went through a bout of rehab that didn\\'t stick, leading the band to cancel its summer tour on a day\\'s notice and enter an unofficial hiatus. During this time, \"Got Me Wrong\" -- a song initially released on Sap -- was pulled as a single from the Clerks soundtrack and wound up as a radio hit. The bigger news during the hiatus was Staley\\'s busman\\'s holiday, Mad Season. Originally the Gacy Bunch at their initial concerts, Mad Season was a Seattle supergroup also featuring Pearl Jam\\'s Mike McCready, the Screaming Trees\\' Barrett Martin, and John Saunders. The band\\'s lone album, Above, arrived in March 1995. As Above was in the middle of its run on the charts -- it peaked at 24 on Billboard\\'s album chart, with \"River of Deceit\" reaching the Top Ten on Billboard\\'s mainstream and modern rock charts -- Alice in Chains reconvened to record their third album with producer Toby Wright. Upon its November 1995 release, the eponymous record debuted at number one on Billboard, with the singles \"Grind\" and \"Heaven Beside You\" reaching the mainstream rock Top Ten; the latter peaked at six on the alternative rock chart. Once again, Alice in Chains were loath to tour. Instead, they recorded a concert -- their first in nearly three years -- for MTV Unplugged on April 10, 1996. By the time the show was released as an album on July 30, Alice in Chains\\' return to the stage was already thwarted: after four supporting dates for Kiss, Staley was found unresponsive after a heroin overdose on July 3, 1996 following a show in Kansas City, Missouri. Staley recovered from his OD but the band struggled as he battled his addiction. Following the death of his former fiancée, Demri Parrott, in October 1996, Staley secluded himself from the public, leading Jerry Cantrell to write and record a solo album called Boggy Depot; Mike Inez and Sean Kinney both appeared on Cantrell\\'s solo effort. Alice in Chains completed two new songs, including the Top Ten mainstream rock hit \"Get Born Again,\" for the 1998 box set Music Bank. The box was the first of a series of archival releases in the next three years: Nothing Safe: The Best of the Box showed up in 1999, followed by the concert compilation Live in 2000 and Greatest Hits in 2001. All the members of Alice in Chains busied themselves during this extended hiatus. Sean Kinney and Mike Inez appeared in Spys4Darwin, Inez gigged with Zakk Wylde\\'s Black Label Society during his downtime, and Cantrell worked on a second solo album. Degradation Trip, the guitarist\\'s sophomore record, appeared in June 2002, two months after Staley was found dead from a drug overdose at his Seattle condo. Alice in Chains parted ways after Staley\\'s death, with Inez becoming a member of Heart and Cantrell collaborating with a number of hard rock and metal acts, including Heart and Ozzy Osbourne. Sony released Alice in Chains from their record contract in 2004, and the next year the group reunited to play a benefit concert for the South Asia tsunami disaster of 2004. Pat Lachman, the singer for Damageplan, acted as Staley\\'s replacement but other stars appeared with the band, too, including Ann Wilson and Maynard James Keenan. The one-off concert went well enough that Alice in Chains decided to make their reunion permanent. Hiring William DuVall, formerly of Comes with the Fall, as Staley\\'s replacement, Alice in Chains toured in 2006, which led to a tour supporting Velvet Revolver in 2007. The revived Alice in Chains recorded a comeback album in 2008 with co-producer Nick Raskulinecz, which appeared in September 2009 as Black Gives Way to Blue. Debuting at five on the Billboard charts, Black Gives Way to Blue wound up going gold while racking up two Grammy nominations, reestablishing Alice in Chains as a force in mainstream and modern rock. The group toured into 2010 and then in 2011 set to work on another album with Raskulinecz. Entitled The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, the album debuted at two upon its release in May 2013. Alice in Chains toured The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here into 2014, then spent the next two years on the road. In 2017, the group started work on another new album with Raskulinecz. Recorded primarily in Seattle, the resulting Rainier Fog appeared in August 2018. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Out of all the former Beatles, Paul McCartney by far had the most successful solo career, maintaining a constant presence in the British and American charts during the 1970s and \\'80s. In America alone, he had nine number one singles and seven number one albums during the first 12 years of his solo career, and in his native United Kingdom, his record was nearly as impressive. McCartney\\'s hot streak began in 1970, when he became the first Beatle to leave the group. A little more than a year after the Beatles\\' breakup, McCartney formed Wings with his wife Linda and Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine, and the group remained active for the next ten years, racking up a string of hit albums, singles, and tours in the meantime. Wings disbanded in 1980, but McCartney stayed near the top of the charts over the next five years, thanks in part to a couple big duets with Michael Jackson. McCartney revived his solo career in 1989 via Flowers in the Dirt and its accompanying international tour, setting a template he would follow into the new millennium, when he\\'d support his records by playing concerts around the world. Between these massive endeavors, McCartney pursued other projects, including classical compositions, an electronica outfit with Youth called the Fireman, and overseeing archival projects such as the Beatles\\' Anthology series. As the 21st century rolled on, McCartney continued to take risks, including recording an album of standards from the Great American Songbook and collaborating with rapper Kanye West, proving that there was no area of popular music he couldn\\'t touch. Like John Lennon and George Harrison, McCartney began exploring creative avenues outside the Beatles during the late \\'60s, but where his bandmates released their own experimental records, McCartney confined himself to writing and producing for other artists, with the exception of his 1966 soundtrack to The Family Way. Following his marriage to Linda Eastman on March 12, 1969, McCartney began working at his home studio on his first solo album. He released McCartney in April 1970, two weeks before the Beatles\\' Let It Be was scheduled to hit the stores. Prior to the album\\'s release, he\\'d announced that the Beatles were breaking up, against the wishes of the other members. As a result, the tensions between him and the other three members, particularly Harrison and Lennon, increased and he earned the ill will of many critics. Nevertheless, McCartney became a hit, spending three weeks at the top of the American charts. Early in 1971, he returned with \"Another Day,\" which became his first hit single as a solo artist. It was followed several months later by Ram, another homemade collection, this time featuring the contributions of his wife, Linda.By the end of 1971, the McCartneys had formed Wings, which was intended to be a full-fledged recording and touring band. Former Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine and drummer Denny Seiwell became the group\\'s other members, and Wings released their first album, Wild Life, in December 1971. Wild Life was greeted with poor reviews and was a relative flop. McCartney and Wings, which now featured former Grease Band guitarist Henry McCullough, spent 1972 as a working band, releasing three singles -- the protest \"Give Ireland Back to the Irish,\" the reggae-fied \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and the rocking \"Hi Hi Hi.\" Red Rose Speedway followed in the spring of 1973, and while it received weak reviews, it became his second American number one album. Later in 1973, Wings embarked on their first British tour, at the conclusion of which McCullough and Seiwell left the band. Prior to their departure, McCartney\\'s theme to the James Bond movie Live and Let Die became a Top Ten hit in the U.S. and U.K. That summer, the remaining Wings proceeded to record a new album in Nigeria. Released late in 1973, Band on the Run was simultaneously McCartney\\'s best-reviewed album and his most successful, spending four weeks at the top of the U.S. charts and eventually going triple-platinum.Following the success of Band on the Run, McCartney formed a new version of Wings with guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton. The new lineup was showcased on the 1974 British single \"Junior\\'s Farm\" and the 1975 hit album Venus and Mars. At the Speed of Sound followed in 1976; it was the first Wings record to feature songwriting contributions by the other bandmembers. Nevertheless, the album became a monster success on the basis of two McCartney songs, \"Silly Love Songs\" and \"Let \\'Em In.\" Wings supported the album with their first international tour, which broke many attendance records and was captured on the live triple-album Wings Over America (1976). After the tour was completed, Wings rested a bit during 1977, as McCartney released an instrumental version of Ram under the name Thrillington, and produced Denny Laine\\'s solo album Holly Days. Later that year, Wings released \"Mull of Kintyre,\" which became the biggest-selling British single of all time, selling over two million copies. Wings followed \"Mull of Kintyre\" with London Town in 1978, which became another platinum record. After its release, McCulloch left the band to join the re-formed Small Faces, and Wings released Back to the Egg in 1979. Though the record went platinum, it failed to produce any big hits. Early in 1980, McCartney was arrested for marijuana possession at the beginning of a Japanese tour; he was imprisoned for ten days and then released, without any charges being pressed.Wings effectively broke up in the wake of McCartney\\'s Japanese bust, although its official dissolution was not announced until April 27, 1981, when Denny Laine left the band. Back in England, McCartney recorded McCartney II, which was a one-man band effort like his solo debut. Ironically, the hit single associated with the album was a live take of the song \"Coming Up\" that had been recorded in Glasgow with Wings in December 1979 and was intended to be the B-side of the 45, with the solo studio recording as the A-side. DJs preferred the live version, however, and it went on to hit number one. Later in 1980, McCartney entered the studio with Beatles producer George Martin to make Tug of War.Released in the spring of 1982, Tug of War received the best reviews of any McCartney record since Band on the Run and spawned the number one single with \"Ebony and Ivory,\" a duet with Stevie Wonder that became McCartney\\'s biggest American hit. In 1983, McCartney sang on \"The Girl Is Mine,\" the first single from Michael Jackson\\'s blockbuster album Thriller. In return, Jackson duetted with McCartney on \"Say Say Say,\" the first single from McCartney\\'s 1983 album Pipes of Peace and the last number one single of his career. The relationship between Jackson and McCartney soured considerably when Jackson bought the publishing rights to the Beatles\\' songs out from underneath McCartney in 1985.McCartney directed his first feature film in 1984 with Give My Regards to Broad Street. While the soundtrack, which featured new songs and re-recorded Beatles tunes, was a hit, generating the hit single \"No More Lonely Nights,\" the film was a flop, earning terrible reviews. The following year, he had his last American Top Ten with the theme to the Chevy Chase/Dan Aykroyd comedy Spies Like Us. Press to Play (1986) received some strong reviews but was another flop. In 1988, he recorded a collection of rock &amp; roll oldies called Choba B CCCP for release in the U.S.S.R.; it was given official release in the U.S. and U.K. in 1991. For 1989\\'s Flowers in the Dirt, McCartney co-wrote several songs with Elvis Costello; the pair also wrote songs for Costello\\'s Spike, including the hit \"Veronica.\" Flowers in the Dirt received the strongest reviews of any McCartney release since Tug of War, and was supported by an extensive international tour, which was captured on the live double-album Tripping the Live Fantastic (1990). For the tour, McCartney hired guitarist Robbie McIntosh and bassist Hamish Stuart, who would form the core of his band through the remainder of the \\'90s. Early in 1991, McCartney released another live album in the form of Unplugged, which was taken from his appearance on MTV\\'s acoustic concert program of the same name; it was the first Unplugged album to be released. Later that year, he unveiled Liverpool Oratorio, his first classical work. Another pop album, Off the Ground, followed in 1993, but failed to generate any big hits, despite McCartney\\'s successful supporting tour. Following the completion of the New World tour, he released another live album, Paul Is Live, in December 1993. In 1994, he released an ambient techno album under the pseudonym the Fireman. McCartney premiered his second classical piece, The Leaf, early in 1995 and then began hosting a Westwood One radio series called Oobu Joobu. But his primary activity in 1995, as well as 1996, was the Beatles\\' Anthology, which encompassed a lengthy video documentary of the band and the multi-volume release of Beatles outtakes and rarities. After Anthology was completed, he released Flaming Pie in summer 1997. A low-key, largely acoustic affair that had some of the same charm of his debut, Flaming Pie was given the strongest reviews McCartney had received in years and was a modest commercial success, debuting at number two on the U.S. and U.K. charts; it was his highest American chart placing since he left the Beatles. Flaming Pie certainly benefited from the success of Anthology, as did McCartney himself -- only a few months before the release of the album in 1997, he received a Knighthood.On April 17, 1998, Linda McCartney died after a three-year struggle with breast cancer. A grieving Paul kept a low profile in the months to follow, but finally returned in fall 1999 with Run Devil Run, a collection that primarily included cover songs. The electronica-based Liverpool Sound Collage followed a year later, and the pop album Driving Rain -- a successor, of sorts, to Flaming Pie -- came a year after that. The live album Back in the U.S. appeared in America in 2002 with the slightly different international edition, Back in the World, following soon after.McCartney\\'s next studio project included sessions with super-producer Nigel Godrich, the results of which appeared on the mellow Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard, released in late 2005. The album reached the Top Ten in more than a dozen countries, including the U.S. and U.K. McCartney performed every instrument (not including the strings) on 2007\\'s David Kahne-produced Memory Almost Full, a bold but whimsical collection of new songs, some of which had been recorded before the Chaos and Creation in the Back Yard sessions. It too reached the Top Ten across the world. A live CD/DVD set, Good Evening New York City, appeared in 2009. The following year, McCartney kicked off an extensive reissue campaign with a box set of Band on the Run, and he supported the reissue with an American tour in the summer of 2011.Later in 2011, McCartney released his first ballet, Ocean\\'s Kingdom, and less than a year later followed with another first -- his first collection of pre-WWII standards. The latter work, titled Kisses on the Bottom, topped the U.S. jazz charts and reached the Top Five in seven different countries. His busy year continued during the summer, when he ended the opening ceremony of London\\'s 2012 Olympics with a set that included a customary extended version of \"Hey Jude.\" A surprising cap to 2012 came that December when he appeared on-stage with the surviving ex-members of Nirvana as part of a benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Sandy.The year 2013 brought recording sessions with four of McCartney\\'s favorite producers: Paul Epworth, Ethan Johns, Giles Martin, and Mark Ronson. His initial intention had been to hold trial sessions with each producer, aiming to select one of them to oversee the whole of his next album. However, each of them had a hand in producing New, his first album of original material in six years, which appeared that October. New debuted in the Top Ten in more than a dozen countries and McCartney supported the album over the next two years with a series of international tours. In 2015, he continued his ongoing Paul McCartney Archive Collection with deluxe reissues of Tug of War and Pipes of Peace. The next summer, he released Pure McCartney, a personally curated overview of his solo career available in two separate incarnations: a double-disc set and a four-disc box. Flowers in the Dirt arrived in early 2017 as part of the singer\\'s Archive Collection. In September 2018, he delivered the Greg Kurstin-produced Egypt Station, his 17th solo album; it was preceded by the singles \"I Don\\'t Know,\" \"Come on to Me,\" and \"Fuh You.\" Egypt Station became McCartney\\'s first number one album in the U.S. since Tug of War; in the U.K. it debuted at three. A couple of non-LP tracks from the Egypt Station sessions appeared in 2019, then McCartney released an Archive edition of Flaming Pie in July 2020. The bigger news for 2020 was the recording and release of McCartney III, an album McCartney wrote and recorded on his own during the global lockdown of 2020. McCartney III appeared on December 18, 2020, giving McCartney his first number one album in the U.K. since Flowers in the Dirt; it debuted at two in the U.S. and spawned a 2021 album of \"reinterpretations, remixes, and covers\" called McCartney III Imagined. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; William Ruhlmann, Rovi'\n",

      "'Argentinian pop/rock band los Enanitos Verdes was formed in the late \\'70s by singer/bassist Marciano Cantero, guitarist Felipe Staiti, and drummer Daniel Piccolo. After moving from Mendoza to Buenos Aires, the band started touring the local club circuit. In 1984, guitarist Sergio Embrioni and keyboardist Tito Dávila joined, and los Enanitos Verdes\\' first album was recorded and released, followed by Contra Reloj, produced by Andrés Calamaro, in 1986. Soon after issuing Carrousel, the band began touring South America, becoming one of the favorite acts at the prestigious Viña del Mar Festival. Around the same time, \"La Muralla Verde\" started climbing the most important Latin rock charts. In 1989, los Enanitos Verdes successfully toured Central America, and reached the U.S. while participating in the Billboard Latin Forum Showcase in 1995. After performing at some North American venues, the original trio lineup recorded 1998\\'s Tracción Acústica and 1999\\'s Grammy-nominated Nectar. Co-founder Marciano Cantero died on September 8, 2022 after being hospitalized for renal failure. He was 62 years old. ~ Drago Bonacich, Rovi'\n",

      "'Originally a raw, visceral blues-rock outfit inspired by the likes of such juke joint rockers as Junior Kimbrough, the Black Keys expanded their purview after mastering their garagey roar with Rubber Factory in 2004. Making the leap to the major-label Nonesuch, the duo of guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney dove into heady psychedelic territory, sometimes assisted by producer Danger Mouse. The band\\'s collaborations with the adventurous hip-hop producer opened the doors to a variety of sounds, colors, and textures, a broadened palette they\\'d channel onto sharp songs on their platinum-selling albums Brothers and El Camino, both arriving in the early years of the 2000s. After the trippy 2014 album Turn Blue, the Black Keys took an extended hiatus through the back half of the 2010s, during which time Auerbach set up his Easy Eye Sound studio and label. The duo returned with renewed vigor on 2019\\'s Let\\'s Rock, maintaining that momentum through the blues covers album Delta Kream in 2021 and the rollicking Dropout Boogie in 2022. Natives of Akron, Ohio, Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney formed the Black Keys in 2001. They released their debut, The Big Come Up, in 2002, receiving strong reviews and sales, and leading to a contract with Fat Possum by the end of the year. That label released Thickfreakness, recorded in a 14-hour session, in the spring of 2003, and the Keys supported the album with an opening tour for Sleater-Kinney. Their momentum escalated considerably with their 2004 album Rubber Factory, which not only received strong reviews but some high-profile play, including a video for \"10 A.M. Automatic\" featuring comedian David Cross. The band\\'s highly touted live act was documented on a 2005 DVD, released the same year that Chulahoma -- an EP of blues covers -- appeared. The Black Keys made the leap to the major labels with 2006\\'s Magic Potion, a moodier record that continued to build their fan base. The band capitalized on that moodiness with 2008\\'s Attack &amp; Release, whose production by Danger Mouse signaled that the Keys were hardly just blues-rock purists. Salvaged from sessions intended as a duet set with Ike Turner, who died before the record could be finished, the album was the Black Keys\\' biggest to date, debuting in the Billboard Top 15 and earning strong reviews. Following the duo\\'s second live DVD, they spent 2009 on side projects, with Auerbach releasing his solo album Keep It Hid in the beginning of the year, and Carney forming the band Drummer, in which he played bass. At the end of 2009, Blakroc, a rap-rock collaboration between the Keys and producer Damon Dash, appeared.Brothers, released in 2010, became their biggest album yet, generating the hit singles \"Tighten Up,\" \"Howlin\\' for You,\" and \"Next Girl.\" It also saw the Keys returning to their tough blues roots with a new grandness, earning three Grammy Awards, landing on year-end lists from NPR to Rolling Stone, and going gold. The band offered a more straight-ahead rock &amp; roll sound with 2011\\'s El Camino. On the strength of the hit single \"Lonely Boy,\" El Camino debuted at number two on Billboard\\'s Top 200 and the Black Keys worked the album hard throughout the next year, releasing \"Gold on the Ceiling\" as the record\\'s second single and touring heavily. In the fall of 2012, the Tour Rehearsal Tapes EP -- a brief collection of live-in-the-studio run-throughs of 2012 material -- was released.Once again tapping Danger Mouse to produce a follow-up, the duo went back into the studio in summer 2013 to record. Standing in contrast to the short, spiky rock &amp; roll of El Camino, Turn Blue had a psychedelic undercurrent that could be heard on its preceding singles \"Fever\" and \"Turn Blue.\" The album appeared early in May 2014 and promptly debuted at the top of the pop charts. Following the promotional cycle for Turn Blue, the Black Keys went on an extended hiatus. Auerbach kept himself busy with plenty of production gigs, along with forming a second band -- the soul-inflected the Arcs --and delivering a second solo album, Waiting for a Song, in 2017. Carney also worked as a producer, notably collaborating with Michelle Branch on her 2017 album Hopeless Romantic.The Black Keys returned to action in March 2019 with the release of the single \"Lo/Hi,\" the first song from their ninth album, Let\\'s Rock. Upon its release in June of that year, the set debuted at four on Billboard\\'s Top 200 and three on the U.K. charts. In 2021, they spotlighted their long-standing love of Mississippi blues performers like R.L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough with their Grammy-nominated covers album Delta Kream. Included on the record was a rendition of the classic Big Joe Williams and John Lee Hooker song \"Crawling Kingsnake.\" For their 11th album Auerbach and Carney went back to their roots, stripping back their writing process to how they originally wrote in their early days before taking the songs into Auerbach\\'s Easy Eye Sound studios to record. The sessions also saw the duo collaborating with ZZ Top\\'s Billy F. Gibbons, Kings of Leon\\'s Angelo Petraglia, and the Reigning Sound\\'s Greg Cartwright. The first fruits of the sessions appeared in early 2022 with the release of the single \"Wild Child\" before the album, Dropout Boogie, was issued in May. ~ Matt Collar &amp; Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'In his brief four-year reign as a superstar, Jimi Hendrix expanded the vocabulary of the electric rock guitar more than anyone before or since. Hendrix was a master at coaxing all manner of unforeseen sonics from his instrument, often with innovative amplification experiments that produced astral-quality feedback, and roaring distortion. His frequent hurricane blasts of noise and dazzling showmanship -- he could and would play behind his back and with his teeth, and set his guitar on fire -- have sometimes obscured his considerable gifts as a songwriter, singer, and master of a gamut of blues, R&amp;B, and rock styles.When Hendrix became an international superstar in 1967, it seemed as if he\\'d dropped out of a Martian spaceship, but in fact he\\'d served his apprenticeship in numerous R&amp;B acts on the chitlin circuit. During the early and mid-\\'60s, he worked with such R&amp;B/soul greats as Little Richard, the Isley Brothers, and King Curtis as a backup guitarist. Occasionally, he recorded as a sessionman (the Isley Brothers\\' 1964 single \"Testify\" is the only one of these early tracks that offers even a glimpse of his future genius). For the most part, his bosses didn\\'t appreciate his show-stealing showmanship, and Hendrix was straitjacketed by sideman roles that didn\\'t allow him to develop as a soloist. The logical step was for him to go out on his own, which he did in New York in the mid-\\'60s, playing with various musicians in local clubs, and joining white blues-rock singer John Hammond, Jr.\\'s band for a while.It was in a New York club that Hendrix was spotted by Animals bassist Chas Chandler. The first lineup of the Animals was about to split, and Chandler, looking to move into management, convinced Hendrix to move to London and record as a solo act in England. There a group was built around Jimi -- featuring Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass -- that was dubbed the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The trio became stars with astonishing speed in the U.K., where \"Hey Joe,\" \"Purple Haze,\" and \"The Wind Cries Mary\" all made the Top Ten in the first half of 1967. These tracks were also featured on their debut album, Are You Experienced?, a psychedelic masterwork that became a huge hit in the U.S. after Hendrix created a sensation at the Monterey Pop Festival in June of 1967.Are You Experienced? was an astonishing debut, particularly from a young R&amp;B veteran who had rarely sung, and apparently never written his own material before the Experience formed. What caught most people\\'s attention at first was his virtuosic guitar playing, which employed an arsenal of devices, including wah-wah pedals, buzzing feedback solos, crunching, distorted riffs, and lightning-quick liquid runs up and down the scales. Hendrix was also a first-rate songwriter, melding cosmic imagery with some surprisingly pop-savvy hooks and tender sentiments. Are You Experienced? was psychedelia at its most eclectic, synthesizing mod pop, soul, R&amp;B, Dylan, and the electric guitar innovations of British pioneers like Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, and Eric Clapton.Amazingly, Hendrix would only record three fully conceived studio albums in his lifetime. Axis: Bold as Love and the double-LP Electric Ladyland were more diffuse and experimental than Are You Experienced? On Electric Ladyland in particular, Hendrix pioneered the use of the studio itself as a recording instrument, manipulating electronics and devising overdub techniques (with the help of engineer Eddie Kramer in particular) to plot uncharted sonic territory. The final two years of Hendrix\\'s life were turbulent ones musically, financially, and personally. He was embroiled in enough complicated management and record company disputes (some dating from ill-advised contracts he\\'d signed before the Experience formed) to keep the lawyers busy for years. He disbanded the Experience in 1969, forming Band of Gypsys with drummer Buddy Miles and bassist Billy Cox to pursue funkier directions. He closed Woodstock with a sprawling, shaky set, redeemed by his famous machine-gun interpretation of \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" The rhythm section of Mitchell and Redding were underrated keys to Jimi\\'s best work, and Band of Gypsys ultimately couldn\\'t measure up to the same standard, although Hendrix did record an erratic live album with them. In early 1970, the Experience re-formed and disbanded again shortly afterward. At the same time, Hendrix felt torn in many directions by various fellow musicians, record company expectations, and management, all of whom had their own ideas of what Hendrix should be doing. Almost two years since Electric Ladyland, a new studio album had yet to appear, although Hendrix was recording constantly during that period.While outside parties did contribute to bogging down Hendrix\\'s studio work, it also seems likely that Hendrix himself was partly responsible for the stalemate, unable to form a permanent lineup of musicians, unable to decide what musical direction to pursue, unable to bring himself to complete another album despite endless jamming. A few months into 1970, Mitchell -- Hendrix\\'s most valuable musical collaborator -- came back into the fold, replacing Miles in the drum chair, although Cox stayed in place. It was this trio that toured the world during Hendrix\\'s final months. With them, and many guest musicians, he had been working intermittently on a new album, tentatively titled First Ray of the New Rising Sun, when he died in London on September 18, 1970, from a drug-related overdose.Hendrix recorded a massive amount of unreleased studio material during his lifetime. Much of this (as well as entire live concerts) was issued posthumously; several of the live concerts were excellent, but the studio tapes have been the focus of enormous controversy for over 20 years. These initially came out in haphazard drabs and drubs (the first, The Cry of Love, was easily the most outstanding of the lot). In the mid-\\'70s, producer Alan Douglas took control of these projects, overdubbing many of Hendrix\\'s tapes with additional parts by studio musicians. In the eyes of many Hendrix fans, this was sacrilege, destroying the integrity of the work of a musician known to exercise meticulous care over the final production of his studio recordings. Even as late as 1995, Douglas was having ex-Knack drummer Bruce Gary record new parts for the compilation Voodoo Soup. After a lengthy legal dispute, the rights to Hendrix\\'s estate, including all of his recordings, returned to Al Hendrix, the guitarist\\'s father, in July of 1995.With the help of Jimi\\'s stepsister Janie, Al set up Experience Hendrix to put Jimi\\'s legacy in order. They began by hiring John McDermott and Jimi\\'s original engineer, Eddie Kramer, to oversee the remastering process. They were able to find all the original master tapes, which had never been used for previous CD releases, and in April of 1997, Hendrix\\'s first three albums were reissued with drastically improved sound. Accompanying those reissues was a posthumous compilation album (based on Jimi\\'s handwritten track listings) called First Rays of the New Rising Sun, made up of tracks from the Cry of Love, Rainbow Bridge, and War Heroes.Later in 1997, another compilation called South Saturn Delta showed up, collecting more tracks from posthumous LPs like Crash Landing, War Heroes, and Rainbow Bridge (without the \\'70s overdubs), along with a handful of never-before-heard material that Chas Chandler had withheld from Alan Douglas for all those years.More archival material followed. Radio One was basically expanded to the two-disc BBC Sessions (released in 1998), and 1999 saw the release of the full show from Woodstock as well as additional concert recordings from Band of Gypsys shows entitled Live at the Fillmore East. 2000 saw the release of the Jimi Hendrix Experience four-disc box set, which compiled remaining tracks from In the West, Crash Landing, and Rainbow Bridge, along with more rarities and alternates from the Chandler cache.The family also launched Dagger Records, essentially an authorized bootleg label, to supply hardcore Hendrix fans with material that would be of limited commercial appeal. Dagger released several live concerts (of shows in Oakland, Ottawa, Clark University in Massachusetts, Paris, San Francisco, Woburn in Bedfordshire, and Cologne) and a collection of studio jams and demos called Morning Symphony Ideas.Mainstream Hendrix reissue activity continued during the 2000s and 2010s, spotlighted by major live albums originally recorded at the Isle of Wight (2002), Berkeley (2003), Monterey (2007), Winterland (2011), and the Miami Pop Festival (2013). In 2010, Sony issued a four-disc set titled West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology, which offered a full disc of recordings from Hendrix\\'s time as a backing guitarist. That same year, Legacy, an imprint of Sony, released Valleys of Neptune. The compilation contained 12 previously unreleased tracks and was the first of many such releases. In 2013, a second compilation appeared. People, Hell and Angels again contained 12 never-before-released songs, which in this case were recorded while Hendrix was working on the follow-up to Electric Ladyland. The final release in this series was put out in 2018, and its ten unreleased tracks also featured guest appearances from Stephen Stills and Johnny Winter. ~ Richie Unterberger &amp; Sean Westergaard, Rovi'\n",

      "'Andres Calamaro is one of the most successful and stylistically diverse artists to emerge from the Rock en Español era. A charting singer, songwriter, and producer, his command of Latin and pop styles has endeared him to audiences across the globe. His 1980s solo outings, such as Hotel Calamaro, Vida Cruel, and Por Mirarte, revealed him as a master craftsman and fearless risk taker. 1989\\'s Nadie Sale Vivo de Aqui proved a commercial breakthrough. After emigrating to Spain in the early 1990s he formed Los Rodriguez with Ariel Rot and Julián Infante, and issued three charting albums including 1995\\'s Palabras Más, Palabras Menos. He returned to solo recording with 1997\\'s smash Alta Suciedad then went on a songwriting tear: He penned over 100 songs for 1999\\'s Honestidad Brutal (37 made the final cut). 2004\\'s El Cantante was his first tango covers set. After 2005\\'s award-winning live date El Regreso took home the Gardel Award for best rock album, he issued the acclaimed Tinta Roja in 2006, a collection of vintage tangos. Calamaro returned to pop with the aptly titled On the Rock in 2010. In 2015 he cut Hijos del Pueblo in collaboration with Spain\\'s Enrique Bunbury. 2018\\'s Cargar La Suerte took home a Latin Grammy, and 2021\\'s Dios Los Cría comprised 15 original songs written as duets for a host of Latin music\\'s most important artists. Born in 1961, Calamaro began his professional musical career at the age of 17 playing keyboards in Raíces. In 1981 he joined one of the main bands of the \\'80s Argentinian rock scene, Los Abuelos de la Nada. Although the band was led by the brilliant Miguel Abuelo, Calamaro composed most of the group\\'s hits, including \"Mil Horas,\" \"Así Es el Calor,\" \"Sin Gamulán,\" and \"Costumbres Argentinas.\" In 1984, he made his solo debut with Hotel Calamaro. The album was a bizarre mix of styles and musicians, and it didn\\'t gain much public or press support. In 1985, Calamaro left Los Abuelos de la Nada and recorded his second album, Vida Cruel. Despite the presence of important musicians and guests such as Luis Alberto Spinetta and Charly García, the album was a disappointment both commercially and artistically. Although Calamaro appeared to be out of luck as a songwriter, he had an intense and successful run as a producer for bands like los Enanitos Verdes, los Fabulosos Cadillacs, and Don Cornelio y la Zona. He also worked and collaborated with many artists of different styles and genres, a constant goal throughout his whole career. Calamaro\\'s third album, Por Mirarte, found him in better form fronting an established band. Released in 1988, it contains some outstanding songs such as \"Con los Dientes Apretados\" and \"Me Olvidé de los Demás,\" while other songs like \"Cartas Sin Marcar\" and \"Loco por Tí\" helped the album gain popularity. When Calamaro released Nadie Sale Vivo de Aquí in 1989, Argentina was struggling in the midst of a difficult economic crisis; consequently, few albums were released, and the production of Nadie Sale suffered. Calamaro left Argentina and settled in Spain, following a road taken by many Argentinian rockers. There he met Ariel Rot and Julian Infante, former members of Tequila. They formed Los Rodríguez in 1991, a pop/rock band that was very popular in Spain and Latin America. Calamaro\\'s songs became popular in the early \\'80s, and the hitmaker was back on the road again. Curiously, working from Spain, he was conquering Argentina. While performing with Los Rodríguez, he didn\\'t release any new solo material, just Grabaciones Encontradas, Vols. 1 &amp; 2, a couple of CDs that contained unreleased and rare material from the \\'80s. After Los Rodríguez split, Calamaro returned to his solo career, recording Alta Suciedad in 1997, an album produced by Joe Blaney. Alta Suciedad brought him the commercial success that had previously eluded his solo endeavors, and it sold 300,000 copies in Argentina alone, certainly a huge number considering that country\\'s small market. No doubt, Alta Suciedad put him in the big leagues, alongside other Latin legends on the national rock scene. Before that album, Calamaro was considered an important character, appreciated by the other musicians, but not by the popular culture at large. After breaking up with his Spanish girlfriend, he released the double-CD Honestidad Brutal in 1999. Recorded when he was 37, it contained 37 songs of despair, love lost, drugs, and regret. It was not as successful as his previous album, but showed a new Calamaro: desperate, decadent, and often elegant at the same time, with a new and raw lyrical approach. El Salmon followed in spring 2001: A mammoth five-disc set of 103 songs (reportedly culled from over 400 written during the previous year); 80-percent were previously unreleased original compositions, with the remaining 20-percent being covers from the most disparate sources -- from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to tango and other Argentine folk music -- along with new versions of a few of his own songs. At the time, the set was largely deemed a chaotic shambles; evidence of the ramblings of a drugged mind, and of a writing/recording obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was considered commercial suicide. Throughout 2001 and 2002, Calamaro released a number of free downloads, as well as giving fans permission to remaster his works. He returned to the studio for El Cantante in 2004 and released a live album, El Regreso, the following year. His next studio album was La Lengua Popular, released in 2007, which was immersed in cumbia. The following year, Calamaro released the live album 2 Son Multitud, which was recorded in Getafe, Spain with Fito &amp; Fitipaldis. Nada Se Pierde followed in 2009 before the singer released On the Rock, his 20th studio album, in 2010. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of El Salmon, the songwriter issued Salmonalipsis Now, which stripped the box set\\'s bedlam down to two discs and 54 songs, with 49 present in their original versions, and five new tracks culled from the same marathon sessions. Perversely, and thus in keeping with the chaotic spirit of the project, tracks are sequenced in a completely and seemingly random new order, thus disrupting the original flow. Critics deemed it an excellent compendium of one of the most bizarre and fascinating albums in Rock en Español history. Following its release, Calamaro uploaded some 2,000 songs to SoundCloud. In 2013, the songwriter surprised audiences with Bohemio, showcasing a brand-new band and a collection of ten new songs produced by Cachorro Lopez (who helmed the sessions for La Lengua Popular. Regarded by critics and audiences alike as his best recording since his last collaboration with the producer, it sold exceptionally well, riding the Top Ten of the Spanish charts for weeks. The following year, Calamaro issued a pair of live albums -- Jamon del Medio and Purasangre -- and undertook a tour opening for longtime friend, Spanish rocker Enrique Bunbury. The encores of all those shows featured the two men performing together backed by Bunbury\\'s band. The ten songs they performed were issued as Hijos del Pueblo in 2015.The following year saw the release of Romaphonic Sessions, on which he was accompanied only by pianist German Wiedemer. In truth, the album was merely a demo that Calamaro presented to film director Fernando Trueba to convince him to produce the album. Comprised of tangos, a cover of Litto Nebbia\\'s \"New Zamba para Mi Tierra,\" and stripped-down rearrangements of his own songs, the director turned him down, assuring the songwriter it was already complete. Calamaro followed it the same year by releasing Volumen 11 -- to signify maximum volume -- that collected a wide variety of 18 songs from between 2012 and 2016. It served as an entry in Grabaciones Encontradas (Found Recordings) series. For Record Store Day 2017, he issued the four-song vinyl EP Licencia Para Cantar, recorded with Wiedemer, Tono Miguel, and Martin Bruhn. In 2018, he collaborated with Lila Downs on a reading of \"En El Ultimo Trago\" for the tribute album Mundo Raro: Las Canciones de José Alfredo Jiménez, to commemorate the great ranchera songwriter\\'s 70th birthday -- he\\'d passed on a year earlier. The track was one of its pre-release singles along with \"Te Solte La Riendar\" by Julietta Venegas. Produced by Camilo Lara and recorded in Mexico City, Monterrey, Los Angeles, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, Madrid, and Texas, it featured 13 tracks from a wide variety of artists including Bunbury, Carla Morrison, Beto Cuevas, and David Hidalgo of Los Lobos. Later that year he issued the full-length Cargar La Suerte for Universal; it took home the Latin Grammy for best pop/rock album of the year. A sold-out globetrotting tour concluded when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the concert industry. While touring, he was writing and envisioning his new songs with the voices of iconic singers performing them. For 2021\\'s Dios Los Cría, he followed that roadmap by creating duets and trios with a host of Latin music\\'s biggest stars. His guests included Downs, Mon Laferte, Enrique Iglesias, Alejandro Sanz, Juanes, and many others. ~ Iván Adaime, Rovi'\n",

      "'Scottish-Irish alt-rock outfit Snow Patrol broke into the mainstream with their 2003 major-label debut Final Straw, a collection of earnest tunes aligned with the sounds of contemporaries like Coldplay, Keane, and Travis. They followed up with the multi-platinum success of 2006\\'s Eyes Open, which featured the international hit single \"Chasing Cars,\" and continued with a pair of U.K. Top Ten platinum efforts, A Hundred Million Suns (2008) and Fallen Empires (2011). After an extended six-year hiatus, during which time frontman Gary Lightbody worked as a songwriter for pop artists, the band returned with Wildness in 2018.Although originally from Northern Ireland, co-founders Gary Lightbody and Mark McClelland relocated to Scotland during their teenage years to attend college. While studying at the University of Dundee in 1994, they began composing music under several different band names, including Shrug and Polar Bear. The duo eventually adopted the Snow Patrol moniker and enlisted Jonny Quinn to play drums in 1997. One year later, Snow Patrol signed with Jeepster Records, a small label based in London, and released the debut effort Songs for Polar Bears. As Snow Patrol\\'s audience modestly expanded, the trio relocated to Glasgow upon graduation. Their second full-length album, When It\\'s All Over We Still Have to Clear Up, was released in April 2001. Jeepster dropped the band from its roster that same year, however, prompting Lightbody to blow off steam by forming the Reindeer Section, a Scottish supergroup featuring members of Mogwai and Belle and Sebastian. He also continued writing songs for Snow Patrol, including a promising ballad entitled \"Run.\" After guitarist Nathan Connolly joined the group in 2002, Snow Patrol signed a contract with Fiction Records and began recording a new album alongside producer Chris Lord-Alge. With the power ballad \"Run\" serving as its lead single, Final Straw became the band\\'s breakthrough hit album, spinning off four Top 40 singles in the U.K. (including \"Spitting Games\") and eventually selling more than four million copies worldwide. Despite the band\\'s growing success, founding member Mark McClelland left in March 2005, effectively downgrading Snow Patrol to a trio comprising Lightbody, Quinn, and Connolly. Shortly thereafter, former Terra Diablo bass player Paul Wilson and touring keyboardist Tom Simpson were permanently added to the lineup, and the group honed its expanded sound by opening shows on the European leg of U2\\'s Vertigo Tour. Upon the tour\\'s completion, they returned to the studio and created the slickly commercial Eyes Open, which was released worldwide in May 2006. Riding the strength of a Grey\\'s Anatomy feature, their single \"Chasing Cars\" became a worldwide smash hit, helping Eyes Open notch gold certification in the United States. It later rose to platinum status, becoming the band\\'s most successful release in America to date. Snow Patrol also became the first U.K. rock act in 13 years to break into the Top Five of the Billboard singles charts, a feat they sought to revisit with the release of 2008\\'s A Hundred Million Suns. Led by the single \"Take Back the City,\" A Hundred Million Suns featured an emphasis on positive, romantic lyrics, something that Gary Lightbody had pointedly shunned in the past. The band joined U2 on the road once again, this time playing stadiums in Europe and America during the summer of 2009. Rather than record another album after the tour, however, they chose to release the comprehensive Up to Now, a compilation spanning Snow Patrol\\'s 15-year history. Lightbody and Simpson also teamed up to compile a mix album, LateNightTales, which featured the band\\'s own take on INXS\\' \"New Sensation.\" Lightbody admitted to a frustrating bout of writer\\'s block before embarking on the group\\'s sixth studio album, 2011\\'s Fallen Empires, which featured the single \"Called Out in the Dark.\" After the release of 2013\\'s Greatest Hits set, Snow Patrol fell silent. After Simpson parted ways with the group, they returned to the studio, teasing new music over the years without any official releases. Members went on to start families and embark on new side projects, as well as producing and songwriting for other artists like Faith Hill, Tim McGraw, Robbie Williams, Ed Sheeran, P!nk, Kodaline, and Taylor Swift. New material from Snow Patrol would not arrive until 2018. Their fifth straight effort with producer Jacknife Lee, Wildness came into being following Lightbody\\'s newfound sobriety, and addressed themes of a primal nature in the modern age on singles like \"Empress\" and \"Life on Earth.\" The next year, they marked 25 years as a band with a standalone single, \"Time Won\\'t Go Slowly,\" and recorded fresh versions of much of their back catalog for compilation project Reworked. ~ Andrew Leahey &amp; Neil Z.

      "'Tom Petty straddled the divide separating classic rock and new wave, revitalizing and reinvigorating the big jangle of the Byrds and the garage rock roar of the Rolling Stones with his earliest records with the Heartbreakers in the late 1970s. Over the next decades, Petty expanded and refined this blend, almost always with guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboardist Benmont Tench -- the musicians who had played with him since the early \\'70s, when they all were in the rambling country-rock outfit Mudcrutch -- by his side. The consistency in personnel and Petty\\'s allegiance to the sounds of the \\'60s did mean his music veered toward classic rock, a perception that tended to obscure the variety within his body of work and how he seemed like a bit of a punk when he released his first album with the Heartbreakers in 1976. The tough, lean sound of Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers was in the same back-to-basics ballpark of the Ramones, and its rawness was evident in its signature single \"American Girl,\" a rock &amp; roll standard that didn\\'t come close to the charts in 1977. Petty didn\\'t land a big hit until he teamed up with producer Jimmy Iovine in 1979 for Damn the Torpedoes, a sleek, streamlined arena rock album that generated smashes in \"Don\\'t Do Me Like That\" and \"Refugee.\" From there, Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers built up a substantial catalog, one that was rooted in rock tradition but flexible enough to accommodate detours into MTV stardom, concept albums, and slick experimentalism, not to mention their leader\\'s occasional solo foray. Petty\\'s solo albums -- the ornate Jeff Lynne-produced Full Moon Fever and the homey Wildflowers, recorded with Rick Rubin -- were two of his biggest records, but he remained a band guy at heart, sticking with the Heartbreakers in the studio and on the road from the mid-\\'90s through the mid-2010s. The band celebrated their longevity with a 40th Anniversary Tour in 2017, at the end of which Petty tragically died from an accidental drug overdose. His passing helped put in perspective how he was one of the greatest rockers and singer/songwriters of his time, amassing a body of work that managed to sound simultaneously timeless and fresh.Born and raised in northern Florida, Petty began playing music while he was still in high school. At the age of 17, he dropped out of school to join Mudcrutch, which also featured guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboardist Benmont Tench. By 1970, Mudcrutch had moved to Los Angeles with hopes of finding a record contract. The fledgling Shelter Records, founded by Leon Russell and Denny Cordell, offered the group a contract. However, Mudcrutch splintered apart shortly after relocating to L.A. Cordell was willing to record Petty as a solo act, but the singer\\'s reception to the idea was tentative. Over the next few years, Petty drifted through bands, eventually hooking back up with Campbell and Tench in 1975. At the time, the duo were working with bassist Ron Blair and drummer Stan Lynch; soon, Petty became involved with the band, which was then named the Heartbreakers. Petty was still under contract to Shelter, and the group assumed his deal, releasing Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers in 1976.Initially, the band\\'s debut was ignored in the United States, but when the group supported it in England with a tour opening for Nils Lofgren, the record began to take off. Within a few months, the band was headlining its own British tours and the album was in the U.K. Top 30. Prompted by the record\\'s British success, Shelter pushed the album and the single \"Breakdown\" in the U.S., this time with success; \"Breakdown\" became a Top 40 hit and \"American Girl\" became an album-oriented radio staple. You\\'re Gonna Get It, the Heartbreakers\\' second album, was released in 1978 and it became the group\\'s first American Top 40 record. Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers were poised to break into the big time when they ran into severe record company problems. Shelter\\'s parent company, ABC, was bought by MCA, and Petty attempted to renegotiate his contract with the label. MCA was unwilling to meet most of his demands, and halfway through 1979, he filed for bankruptcy. Soon afterward, he settled into an agreement with MCA, signing with their subsidiary Backstreet Records. Released late in 1979, Damn the Torpedoes was his first release on Backstreet.The album was Petty\\'s breakthrough release, earning uniformly excellent reviews, generating the Top Ten hit \"Don\\'t Do Me Like That\" and the number 15 \"Refugee,\" and spending seven weeks at number two on the U.S. charts; it would eventually sell over two million copies. Though he was at a peak of popularity, Petty ran into record company trouble again when he and the Heartbreakers prepared to release Hard Promises, the 1981 follow-up to Damn the Torpedoes. MCA wanted to release the record at the list price of $9.98, which was a high price at the time. Petty refused to comply to their wishes, threatening to withhold the album from the label and organizing a fan protest that forced the company to release the record at $8.98. Hard Promises became a Top Ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single \"The Waiting.\" Later that year, Petty produced Del Shannon\\'s comeback album Drop Down and Get Me and wrote \"Stop Draggin\\' My Heart Around\" as a duet for himself and Stevie Nicks. Featured on her album Bella Donna, which was recorded with the Heartbreakers\\' support, \"Stop Draggin\\' My Heart Around\" became a number three hit. Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers returned late in 1982 with Long After Dark, which became their third Top Ten album in a row. Following its release, bassist Ron Blair left the band and was replaced by Howie Epstein, who previously played with John Hiatt.Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers spent nearly three years making Southern Accents, the follow-up to Long After Dark. Hiring Eurythmics\\' Dave Stewart as a producer, the band attempted to branch out musically, reaching into new territories like soul, psychedelia, and new wave. However, the recording wasn\\'t easy -- at its worst, Petty punched a studio wall and broke his left hand, reportedly in frustration over the mixing. Southern Accents was finally released in the spring of 1985, preceded by the neo-psychedelic single \"Don\\'t Come Around Here No More,\" which featured a popular, pseudo-Alice in Wonderland video. Southern Accents was another hit record, peaking at number seven and going platinum. Following its release, Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers spent 1986 on tour as Bob Dylan\\'s backing band. Dylan contributed to the lead single \"Jammin\\' Me,\" from the Heartbreakers\\' next album, Let Me Up (I\\'ve Had Enough), which was released to mixed reviews in the spring of 1987. Just after the record\\'s release, Petty\\'s house and most of his belongings were destroyed by fire; he, his wife, and two daughters survived unscathed.In 1988, Petty became a member of the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, which also featured Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne. The Wilburys released their first album at the end of 1988 and its sound became the blueprint for Petty\\'s first solo effort, 1989\\'s Full Moon Fever. Produced by Lynne and featuring the support of most of the Heartbreakers, Full Moon Fever became Petty\\'s commercial pinnacle, reaching number three on the U.S. charts, going triple platinum, and generating the hit singles \"I Won\\'t Back Down,\" \"Runnin\\' Down a Dream,\" and \"Free Fallin\\',\" which reached number seven. In 1990, he contributed to the Traveling Wilburys\\' second album, Vol. 3. Petty officially reunited with the Heartbreakers on Into the Great Wide Open, which was also produced by Jeff Lynne. Released in the spring of 1991, Into the Great Wide Open sustained the momentum of Full Moon Fever, earning strong reviews and going platinum. Following the release of 1993\\'s Greatest Hits, which featured two new tracks produced by Rick Rubin, including the Top 20 hit \"Mary Jane\\'s Last Dance,\" Petty left MCA for Warner Bros.; upon signing, it was revealed that he\\'d negotiated a $20 million deal in 1989. Drummer Stan Lynch left the Heartbreakers in 1994, as Petty was recording his second solo album with producer Rubin and many members of the Heartbreakers. Like Full Moon Fever before it, 1994\\'s Wildflowers was greeted by enthusiastic reviews and sales, tying his previous solo album for his biggest-selling studio album. In addition to going triple platinum and peaking at number eight, the album spawned the hit singles \"You Don\\'t Know How It Feels,\" \"You Wreck Me,\" and \"It\\'s Good to Be King.\" Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers reunited in 1996 to record the soundtrack for the Edward Burns film She\\'s the One. The resulting soundtrack album was a moderate hit, peaking at number 15 on the U.S. charts and going gold. Echo followed three years later, becoming the first Heartbreakers record to make the Top Ten in almost 15 years.The Last DJ, a scathing attack on the corporate greed inherent in the music business, was released in 2002, followed in 2006 by a solo album, Highway Companion; both albums reached the Top Ten, and Highway Companion went gold in the U.S. After this, Petty reunited his original band Mudcrutch for a 2008 album and tour. Mojo, credited to Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, appeared from Reprise in 2010. The band toured fairly regularly over the next four years, then returned in the summer of 2014 with Hypnotic Eye, the first number one album in their career. Two years later, Petty reconvened Mudcrutch for their second album, appropriately titled 2. On October 2, 2017, Petty was found at his home in cardiac arrest, and he died at a hospital in Santa Monica later that day. Nearly a year later, his family and band released the box set An American Treasure as a tribute to the departed rocker. A double-disc hits collection, The Best of Everything, followed in March 2019. Prior to his death, Petty began work on an expanded reissue of 1994\\'s Wildflowers, restoring it to its original double-album length. His family and collaborators finished the project posthumously, releasing it as the box set Wildflowers....And All the Rest in October 2020. The same team produced a revamped version of Songs and Music from \"She\\'s the One\" that removed the Wildflowers outtakes and added previously unreleased songs. It was retitled Angel Dream and released in July of 2021. Live at the Fillmore, 1997, the next major archival release from Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, arrived in November 2022. Documenting the group\\'s 20-night residency at the Fillmore in San Francisco at the start of 1997, the four-CD box set -- released in conjunction with a two-CD distillation --was filled with covers and obscurities, along with cameos by John Lee Hooker and Roger McGuinn. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'One of the major singer/songwriters to emerge in the 1960s, Paul Simon helped define the parameters of folk-rock with the records he made with his partner Art Garfunkel. Over the course of five albums, Simon &amp; Garfunkel created some of the most indelible music of the \\'60s, including such perennials as \"The Sounds of Silence,\" \"Mrs. Robinson,\" and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" The duo split at the height of their popularity in 1970, leading Simon to launch a solo career with an eponymous debut in 1972, a record that established his increasingly adventurous musicality and lyrical sophistication. Simon\\'s mastery of mature mainstream pop quickly became evident -- he regularly appeared in the Top Ten in the \\'70s with such hits as \"Mother and Child Reunion,\" \"Kodachrome,\" Loves Me Like a Rock,\" and \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,\" the latter taken from his Grammy-winning Album of the Year, 1975\\'s Still Crazy After All These Years -- but by the \\'80s he became artistically restless. An exploration of African music revitalized him creatively and commercially, resulting in the 1986 landmark Graceland, which became his second Album of the Year Grammy winner. The ensuing decades found Simon attempting a variety of experiments, ranging from a Broadway musical and a 2006 collaboration with Brian Eno, to the hushed mini-suite of 2023\\'s Seven Psalms.Paul Frederic Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey on October 13, 1941. His father, Louis Simon, was an educator who also led a small jazz combo, while his mother, Belle Simon, taught English; when Paul was a few months old, they moved from Newark to Queens, New York. Paul grew up with a passion for baseball and music, particularly jazz and folk, and as he entered his teens, he developed a taste for the doo wop and R&amp;B sounds that were a staple of Alan Freed\\'s radio broadcasts, as well as first-generation rockabillies such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins. When Simon was 11 years old, he met Art Garfunkel, and the two became fast friends who discovered they shared an interest in music. Paul and Art formed a harmony duo in the style of their heroes the Everly Brothers and made their stage debut at a junior high talent show. By the time they were enrolled at Forest Hills High School, the two were calling themselves Tom &amp; Jerry (Art was Tom Graph, Paul was Jerry Landis), and they filled their spare time playing teen dances and parties. In 1955, the two wrote a song together, \"The Girl for Me,\" which Simon registered for copyright with the Library of Congress. In 1957, Tom &amp; Jerry were cutting a demo acetate of Simon\\'s song \"Hey Schoolgirl\" when the president of a small record company (ironically named Big Records) happened by the studio. The label head liked what he heard and \"Hey Schoolgirl\" b/w \"Dancin\\' Wild\" was released in the fall of 1957. The record rose to number 52 on the Billboard pop singles charts, and scored Tom &amp; Jerry an appearance on American Bandstand, but while they would cut a number of follow-up releases, \"Hey Schoolgirl\" was destined to be Tom &amp; Jerry\\'s only hit. By March 1958, Simon was already looking toward a solo career, cutting a single, \"True or False\" b/w \"Teen Age Fool,\" under the name True Taylor. Jerry Landis also landed his own record deal, releasing his debut single, \"Anna Belle\" b/w \"Loneliness,\" in 1959, while Simon also worked with a studio group called the Cosines, who specialized in cutting demos for songwriters. (Another member of the combo was Carole Klein, who would soon enjoy a successful career of her own as Carole King.) By the end of the decade, Paul and Art were both enrolled in college, and Tom &amp; Jerry took a back seat to academics, though Simon would record occasional sessions and wrote songs for others. In 1961, Simon teamed up with a handful of vocalists to form a group called Tico &amp; the Triumphs; the group cut a single, \"Motorcycle\" b/w \"I Don\\'t Believe Them,\" which barely broke into the Billboard singles charts, making number 99 for one week, but received extensive airplay in Baltimore and became a local hit in the Charm City. \"Motorcycle\" was released by Amy Records, which soon turned to Simon to write and produce material for several of their artists, including Ritchie Cordell, the Fashions, Dottie Daniels, and Jay Walker &amp; the Pedestrians. Simon also found time to cut another Jerry Landis single, and \"The Lone Teen Ranger\" spent three weeks on the Billboard charts in early 1963, peaking at number 97. In the early \\'60s, the folk revival swept New York City, and a new breed of singers and songwriters introduced a new approach to the craft of creating tunes. Simon, who had been studying English literature, was influenced and encouraged by the new breed of folkies, and in 1963 he re-teamed with Art Garfunkel, this time using their real names and performing the more topical songs Simon was writing. Simon &amp; Garfunkel started playing Greenwich Village folk clubs, and they scored a deal with Columbia Records, releasing their first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 AM, in the fall of 1964. The album was initially a flop, and Simon headed to England, where he made the rounds of folk clubs, recorded some BBC sessions, and even cut a solo album, The Paul Simon Songbook, which was released only in the U.K. Simon also co-wrote a few pop tunes with Bruce Woodley of the Seekers, one of which, \"Red Rubber Ball,\" would become a big hit for the Cyrkle. In late 1965, Tom Wilson, who produced the Wednesday Morning, 3 AM album, learned that one of the songs from the LP, \"The Sound of Silence,\" was getting scattered radio airplay, and he struck upon the idea of dubbing a rock &amp; roll rhythm section over the acoustic track and issuing it as a single. The strategy worked: the new version of \"The Sound of Silence\" was a big hit, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel quickly re-formed, cutting the album Sounds of Silence, which was released in 1966 and spawned the singles \"I Am a Rock\" and \"Kathy\\'s Song.\"Simon &amp; Garfunkel would enjoy impressive success over the next several years and were one of the few acts from the early-\\'60s folk revival that would enjoy success with acoustic-based music during the psychedelic era, thanks in large part to Simon\\'s songwriting. But while 1970\\'s Bridge Over Troubled Water was a massive commercial and critical success (and a superb reflection of the end-of-the-decade Zeitgeist of the day), long-simmering creative differences between Simon and Garfunkel came to a head while making the album, and a hiatus from collaborating became a proper breakup when Simon released his self-titled solo album in 1972. Paul Simon featured two hit singles, \"Mother and Child Reunion\" and \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard,\" and found Simon experimenting with reggae and Latin music, as well as polished soft rock. Released in 1973, There Goes Rhymin\\' Simon was a more ambitious follow-up, sounding largely optimistic and dipping its toes into gospel and New Orleans jazz as well as R&amp;B-based rock and pop. In 1975, Simon released Still Crazy After All These Years, an album informed by his divorce from his first wife, Peggy Harper. Still Crazy included the song \"My Little Town,\" which reunited Simon with Art Garfunkel for the first time since Bridge Over Troubled Water. Simon\\'s next project proved to have a long gestation period; he wrote a screenplay about a musician struggling to save his marriage and his career, and penned a set of songs to accompany it. Simon also starred in the subsequent film, and while One Trick Pony wasn\\'t his first bit of film acting (he played a small but memorable role in Woody Allen\\'s Annie Hall), he didn\\'t fare well alongside a cast of seasoned professionals when the movie debuted in 1980. One Trick Pony\\'s soundtrack album (his first album for Warner Bros. after a long working relationship with Columbia) spawned the hit single \"Late in the Evening,\" but otherwise proved to be a disappointment in terms of sales. In September 1981, Simon &amp; Garfunkel played a massive reunion concert in New York\\'s Central Park, which led to a brief reunion tour. The Central Park show was released as a live album that was a major commercial success, and the duo made plans to record a new album. But Simon and Garfunkel found themselves at odds in the studio, and Simon\\'s next album, 1983\\'s Hearts and Bones, featured no contributions from Garfunkel. The album sold poorly, and by Simon\\'s own admission he was running short on inspiration when he heard an album of \"township jive\" by the South African group the Boyoyo Boys. Fascinated by the eclectic blend of creative elements, Simon began creating an album inspired by South African pop, recorded primarily in Johannesburg with a band of South African musicians. The result was 1986\\'s Graceland, which became an unexpected smash hit, spawning several hit singles, introducing an international audience to South African rhythms, and prompting a renewed dialogue about the nation\\'s repressive apartheid regime. (The album also generated a certain amount of controversy, as some believed the recording sessions violated a United Nations-led cultural boycott against South Africa; also, several members of the group Los Lobos, who appeared on the album, claimed Simon lifted their melody for the tune \"All Around the World, or the Myth of Fingerprints\" without giving them songwriting credit.) Simon turned to Brazilian music for inspiration on his next album, 1990\\'s The Rhythm of the Saints, which also incorporated a number of the South African players who contributed to Graceland. If not as successful as Graceland, The Rhythm of the Saints still fared quite well with fans and critics, and the two albums reestablished Simon as a vital contemporary artist.After releasing a live album from the tour in support of The Rhythm of the Saints, Simon retreated to work on another unusual project, a Broadway musical called The Capeman, which was based on the true story of Salvador Agron, a Latino gang member and convicted murderer turned poet and activist. Simon wrote the book for The Capeman in collaboration with Derek Walcott and composed a set of new songs for the show. However, the production proved difficult and the play, which opened in 1998, received poor reviews and closed after just 68 performances due to slow ticket sales. (A revised version of the show was staged in 2010, and received significantly better notices.) An album of Simon\\'s interpretations of the show\\'s songs was issued but was only a modest success; the original cast recording received a belated digital release in 2006. Stung by the disappointing response to The Capeman, Simon returned to the studio in 2000 to record You\\'re the One, an album that suggested a compromise between the African and Latin sounds he\\'d embraced and the more intimate approach of his early work. Two years later, Simon once again reunited with Art Garfunkel for a concert tour, and a live album, Old Friends: Live on Stage, was released in 2004. Simon returned in 2006 with Surprise, which found him working with an unlikely producer, Brian Eno. Released in 2011, So Beautiful or So What captured Simon returning to a more organic songwriting style than he\\'d employed since Graceland, though the tenor of the lyrics confirmed he was still keenly aware of the sounds and ideas of the present day. The album was also his first release for Hear Music; the same label released 2012\\'s Live in New York City, taken from a special intimate hometown concert from the tour in support of So Beautiful. Simon returned in the summer of 2016 with Stranger to Stranger, an album co-produced by his longtime collaborator Roy Halee and released on Concord Records. Simon embarked on a farewell tour in 2018, toward the end of which he released In the Blue Light, a collection of reinterpretations of songs he felt were overlooked when he\\'d written them. Despite all these looks backward, Simon hadn\\'t retired from songwriting. He returned in May 2023 with Seven Psalms, a suite of songs designed to be listened to as a collective piece. The acoustic-based mini-suite featured appearances by VOCES8 and vocals by Edie Brickell. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'Soft rock singer/songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and producer Kenny Loggins had a consistent string of hits in the 1970s, \\'80s, and \\'90s. After playing in several bands in the late \\'60s and honing his songwriting chops as a staff songwriter at Wingate Music, Loggins rose to prominence with Loggins &amp; Messina, a duo with fellow singer/songwriter Jim Messina. The two were together from 1972 to 1976, and released a string of successful albums. Loggins\\' first solo album, Celebrate Me Home, was released in 1977, and included the hit \"I Believe in Love.\" He enjoyed even more success in the \\'80s, scoring hits with songs cut for movie soundtracks such as \"I\\'m Alright\" (Caddyshack), \"Footloose\" (Footloose), and \"Danger Zone\" (Top Gun). Throughout the \\'90s and 2000s, Loggins continued to produce albums, and in the 2000s he also reunited with Messina for a tour.Loggins was born in Everett, Washington in early 1948, and the family later moved to Detroit, and finally to Alhambra, California when he was in his teens. He initially turned to music as a way of compensating for his extreme shyness, and found that he was, indeed, a talented guitarist and had a voice. For a time in the late \\'60s he was based in Pasadena, studying at Pasadena City College. At the end of the decade, Loggins passed through the lineup of a band called Gator Creek, who were good enough to get signed to Mercury Records. The group recorded one self-titled album, which was issued in 1970 and included an early version of \"Danny\\'s Song,\" a track he recorded again as part of Loggins &amp; Messina. He also spent time with a short-lived group called Second Helping, and was a member of the stage incarnation of the Electric Prunes during a later phase of that group\\'s history.Loggins was proficient on the guitar and piano, but it was his songwriting that enabled him to make his first lasting impression on the music industry. He took a job as a staff writer for Wingate Music, for $100 per week, and later that year, four of his songs ended up on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album Uncle Charlie &amp; His Dog Teddy. This event was particularly fortuitous as that album was the first release by the newly reconstituted version of the group, and included what proved to be their biggest hit, \"Mr. Bojangles.\" The presence of the latter helped make Uncle Charlie one of the group\\'s biggest-selling long-players; and the exposure generated a second hit in the form of Loggins\\' own \"House at Pooh Corner.\"The success of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\\'s recordings brought Loggins to the attention of former Poco member Jim Messina, who was working as a staff producer at CBS. It was Messina\\'s intention to produce Loggins\\' debut album, but he also ended up playing and singing on the record, and it worked out so well that the two ended up in a duo. Loggins &amp; Messina were among the most popular folk-based soft rock acts of the first half of the \\'70s, and enjoyed a four-year string of successful albums.Loggins &amp; Messina broke up in 1976, and Loggins retained a strong following in the years immediately after. He went on to solo stardom with such million-selling albums as Celebrate Me Home, Nightwatch (which included the hit \"Whenever I Call You Friend\"), and Keep the Fire, all in the cheerful, sensitive style he had displayed in Loggins &amp; Messina. Loggins also became known as the king of the movie soundtrack song, scoring Top Ten hits with \"I\\'m Alright\" (from Caddyshack), \"Footloose\" (from Footloose), \"Danger Zone\" (from Top Gun), and \"Nobody\\'s Fool\" (from Caddyshack 2). During this period, he was also one of the participants in USA for Africa on the benefit recording \"We Are the World.\" His own albums sold less well (and came less frequently) throughout the \\'80s, with later efforts like 1991\\'s Leap of Faith, 1997\\'s The Unimaginable Life, and 1998\\'s December finding favor primarily in adult contemporary circles; in 1994, he also issued a children\\'s album, Return to Pooh Corner, and released its sequel, More Songs from Pooh Corner, in early 2000. He reunited with Messina in 2005 for a successful tour, album, and concert video, and in 2007, Loggins released How About Now, his first new solo album in four years. It was followed by the children\\'s album, All Join In, in 2009. A compilation of his movie soundtrack themes, At the Movies, arrived in 2021 as part of Record Store Day. ~ William Ruhlmann &amp; Bruce Eder, Rovi'\n",

      "'During the late \\'90s, Creed emerged from a sea of post-grunge contenders to become one of the decade\\'s biggest-selling rock bands. At a time when many other Seattle disciples were lapsing into inactivity or experimenting with less commercial sounds, Creed carried the torch of straightforward, grungy hard rock without apology -- and they were amply rewarded, selling millions upon millions of albums in just a few years\\' time. That success didn\\'t translate into critical acclaim, however. Many reviewers slammed the band\\'s music as derivative, and frontman Scott Stapp was lambasted by publications like Rolling Stone for being \"irony-deficient, Jesus-haired, and often shirtless in a way that reminded people of the guy from Lord of the Dance.\" Based on their frequently spiritual lyrics, some observers deemed Creed part of a new breed of alternative-styled Christian bands, an affiliation that Creed actively tried to downplay. Neither critical jabs nor a potential secular backlash could derail the band, though, and they went into the new millennium as a seemingly unstoppable commercial juggernaut. Ultimately, it was Stapp\\'s substance abuse and increasingly erratic behavior that brought an end to Creed\\'s heyday in 2004. The remaining members partnered with vocalist Myles Kennedy to form Alter Bridge, while Stapp briefly pursued a solo career before reconvening with Creed in late 2008.Creed took root in 1994 in Tallahassee, Florida. Founding members Scott Stapp and guitarist Mark Tremonti had been classmates in high school and both attended Florida State University, where Stapp studied law before dropping out to pursue music (a decision that led to conflict with his anti-rock &amp; roll parents, as his father was a Pentecostal minister). Stapp and Tremonti began writing songs together, many of which obliquely addressed themes of Christian spirituality, and added a rhythm section consisting of bassist Brian Marshall and drummer Scott Phillips. As an alternative to the band\\'s original moniker (Naked Toddler), Marshall suggested the name Creed, having previously played in another band dubbed Mattox Creed. Now boasting a new name and a muscled, modern rock sound, Creed went on to form their own label, Blue Collar, before entering the studio in 1997 with producer John Kurzweg. Recorded on a shoestring budget of $6,000 and initially self-released in a limited run, their debut album, My Own Prison, was soon picked up by Wind-Up Records -- a fledgling imprint with distribution through Sony -- and treated to a beefy remix that gave it a heavier, radio-friendly punch. The trick worked, as My Own Prison subsequently spun off no less than four number one singles -- \"My Own Prison,\" \"Torn,\" \"What\\'s This Life For,\" and \"One\" -- on Billboard\\'s mainstream rock radio charts, making Creed the first band to accomplish the feat with its debut album. My Own Prison proved to be extremely popular, moving over five million copies over several years\\' time despite little MTV exposure or media coverage.Although Creed saw a good deal of competition from their post-grunge contemporaries, the band\\'s sophomore album demonstrated their staying power. Released in the fall of 1999 (when tracks from My Own Prison were still peppering the Billboard charts and radio playlists), Human Clay turned out to be a blockbuster, entering the charts at number one and selling a whopping ten million copies over the next two years. The album\\'s leadoff single, \"Higher,\" spent a record-breaking 17 weeks at number one on rock radio, and the follow-up singles \"What If\" and \"With Arms Wide Open\" topped the chart as well. This gave the band seven consecutive chart-topping hits on rock radio. \"With Arms Wide Open\" also gave Creed their first number one pop hit; several months later, the song won a Grammy for Best Rock Song.During the summer of 2000, bassist Brian Marshall made headlines for criticizing Pearl Jam\\'s recent songwriting style during a radio interview; he later apologized, and Stapp distanced the rest of the band from Marshall\\'s comments on Creed\\'s website. Months later, as the band readied itself for an American tour, it was announced that Marshall was no longer a member of Creed. He was quickly replaced by touring bassist Brett Hestla (also of Virgos Merlot) and later formed a new band, Grand Luxx, with his old bandmates from Mattox Creed. That same summer, Stapp was goaded into a brief media feud with Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, who launched into a profane tirade against Stapp at a summer festival that both bands were playing. Although Stapp later blasted Durst\\'s business tactics (as senior VP at Interscope), claiming they stemmed from a \"mobster mentality,\" things soon reverted to normal as the band returned to the studio. Creed worked on their new album for much of 2001; although Hestla remained in the touring lineup, Tremonti chose to handle the bass parts himself, preserving the band\\'s initial core. Weathered was then released in November 2001, entering the charts at number one and tying a record (among other number one debuts) by remaining there for eight straight weeks; during that two-month time, it also sold a staggering five million copies. The first single, \"My Sacrifice,\" was a Top Five pop hit that spent nine weeks atop the rock radio charts. \"One Last Breath\" also demonstrated the band\\'s crossover appeal by faring well on both charts.Stapp was involved in a car accident in April 2002 and suffered both a concussion and vertebrae damage. Creed initially canceled the rest of their tour, but Stapp recovered quickly, allowing the band to reschedule most of their show dates during the summer. Stapp\\'s health was slipping in other ways, however, as he developed an addiction to Percocet and began taking a host of other medications on the road, including Xanax and throat steroids. The tour concluded with an infamous performance in Chicago, during which an obviously intoxicated Stapp performed one song while lying on his back. Such problems quickly led to the band\\'s unraveling.Wind-Up Records officially announced the breakup of Creed in June 2004. Over the course of ten years, the band had sold over 30 million albums worldwide and became one of the biggest touring draws of the \\'90s. Founding members Mark Tremonti, Scott Phillips, and Brian Marshall went on to form Alter Bridge with ex-Mayfield Four frontman Myles Kennedy. Scott Stapp went on to issue a solo record, 2005\\'s The Great Divide, which included a collection of rock songs inspired by Mel Gibson\\'s Passion of the Christ. Three years later, Stapp and Tremonti reconvened at the Hard Rock Hotel in Florida, where they began to reconcile past differences. Shortly thereafter, the two persuaded Scott Phillips and original bassist Brian Marshall to band together once again, thus cementing Creed\\'s reunion. They booked a series of shows for the summer of 2009 in support of the album Full Circle, which was released later that year. ~ Andrew Leahey &amp; Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "'Most rock &amp; roll bands are a tightly wound unit that developed their music through years of playing in garages and clubs around their hometown. Steely Dan never subscribed to that aesthetic. As the vehicle for the songwriting of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen, Steely Dan defied all rock &amp; roll conventions. Becker and Fagen never truly enjoyed rock -- with their ironic humor and cryptic lyrics, their eclectic body of work shows some debt to Bob Dylan -- preferring jazz, traditional pop, blues, and R&amp;B. Steely Dan created a sophisticated, distinctive sound with accessible melodic hooks, complex harmonies and time signatures, and a devotion to the recording studio. With producer Gary Katz, Becker and Fagen gradually changed Steely Dan from a performing band to a studio project, hiring professional musicians to record their compositions. Though the band didn\\'t perform live between 1974 and 1993, Steely Dan\\'s popularity continued to grow throughout the \\'70s as their albums became critical favorites and their singles became staples of AOR and pop radio stations. Even after the group disbanded in the early \\'80s, their records retained a cult following, as proven by the massive success of their unlikely return to the stage in the early \\'90s.Walter Becker (bass) and Donald Fagen (vocals, keyboards) were the core members of Steely Dan throughout its various incarnations. The two met at Bard College in New York in 1967 and began playing in bands together shortly afterward. The duo played in a number of groups -- including the Bad Rock Group, which featured future comedic actor Chevy Chase on drums -- which ranged from jazz to progressive rock. Eventually, Becker and Fagen began composing songs together, hoping to become professional songwriters in the tradition of the Brill Building. In 1970, the pair joined Jay &amp; the Americans\\' backing band, performing under pseudonyms; Becker chose Gustav Mahler, while Fagen used Tristan Fabriani. They stayed with Jay &amp; the Americans until halfway through 1971, when they recorded the soundtrack for the low-budget film You Gotta Walk It Like You Talk It, which was produced by the Americans\\' Kenny Vance. Following the recording of the soundtrack, Becker and Fagen attempted to start a band with Denny Dias, but the venture was unsuccessful. Barbra Streisand recorded the Fagen/Becker composition \"I Mean to Shine\" on her album Barbra Joan Streisand, released in August 1971, and the duo met producer Gary Katz, who hired them as staff songwriters for ABC/Dunhill in Los Angeles, where he had just become a staff producer. Katz suggested that Becker and Fagen form a band as a way to record their songs, and Steely Dan -- who took their name from a dildo in William Burroughs\\' Naked Lunch -- were formed shortly afterward.Recruiting guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff \"Skunk\" Baxter, drummer Jim Hodder, and keyboardist/vocalist David Palmer, Becker and Fagen officially formed Steely Dan in 1972, releasing their debut, Can\\'t Buy a Thrill, shortly afterward. Palmer and Fagen shared lead vocals on the album, but the record\\'s two hit singles -- the Top Ten \"Do It Again\" and \"Reeling in the Years\" -- were sung by Fagen. Can\\'t Buy a Thrill was a critical and commercial success, but its supporting tour was a disaster, hampered by an under-rehearsed band and unappreciative audiences. Palmer left the band following the tour. Countdown to Ecstasy, released in 1973, was a critical hit, but it failed to generate a hit single, even though the band supported it with a tour. Steely Dan replaced Hodder with Jeff Porcaro and added keyboardist/backup vocalist Michael McDonald prior to recording their third album, Pretzel Logic. Released in the spring of 1974, Pretzel Logic returned Steely Dan to the Top Ten on the strength of the single \"Rikki Don\\'t Lose That Number.\" After completing the supporting tour for Pretzel Logic, Becker and Fagen decided to retire from live performances and make Steely Dan a studio-based band. For their next album, 1975\\'s Katy Lied, the duo hired a variety of studio musicians -- including Dias, Porcaro, guitarist Elliot Randall, saxophonists Phil Woods, bassist Wilton Felder, percussionist Victor Feldman, keyboardist Michael Omartian, and guitarist Larry Carlton -- as supporting musicians. Katy Lied was another hit, as was 1976\\'s The Royal Scam, which continued in the vein of its predecessor. On 1977\\'s Aja, Steely Dan\\'s sound became more polished and jazzy, as they hired jazz fusion artists like Wayne Shorter, Lee Ritenour, and the Crusaders as support. Aja became their biggest hit, reaching the Top Five within three weeks of release and becoming one of the first albums to be certified platinum. Aja also gained the respect of many jazz musicians, as evidenced by Woody Herman recording an album of Becker/Fagen songs in 1978. Following the release of Aja, ABC was bought out by MCA Records, resulting in a contractual dispute with the label that delayed until 1980 the release of their follow-up album. During the interim, the group had a hit with the theme song for the film FM in 1978. Steely Dan finally released Gaucho, the follow-up to Aja, in late 1980, and it became another Top Ten hit for the group. During the summer of 1981, Becker and Fagen announced that they were parting ways. The following year, Fagen released his solo debut, The Nightfly, which became a critical and commercial hit.Fagen didn\\'t record another album until 1993, when he reunited with Becker, who produced Kamakiriad. The album was promoted by the first Steely Dan tour in nearly 20 years, and while the record failed to sell, the concerts were very popular. In 1994, Becker released his solo debut, 11 Tracks of Whack, which was produced by Fagen. The following year, Steely Dan mounted another reunion tour, and in early 2000 the duo issued Two Against Nature, their first new studio album in two decades. It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Steely Dan followed it in 2003 with Everything Must Go. Fagen\\'s solo album Morph the Cat was released in 2006, and Becker released Circus Money in 2008 as Steely Dan embarked on another tour. In September 2017, it was announced that Becker had died in Maui, Hawaii. He was 67-years-old. Fagen carried on with Steely Dan after Becker\\'s passing, often calling the group \"the Steely Dan Band.\" This new lineup was showcased on a pair of live albums released in September 2021: Northeast Corridor: Steely Dan Live and Donald Fagen\\'s The Nightfly Live, both recorded between 2018 and 2019. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Upon the release of their first album in the late \\'70s, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers were shoehorned into the punk/new wave movement by some observers who picked up on the tough, vibrant energy of the group\\'s blend of Byrds riffs and Stonesy swagger. In a way, the categorization made sense. Compared to the heavy metal and art rock that dominated mid-\\'70s guitar rock, the Heartbreakers\\' bracing return to roots was nearly as unexpected as the crashing chords of the Clash. As time progressed, it became clear that the band didn\\'t break from tradition like their punk contemporaries. Instead, they celebrated it, culling the best parts of the British Invasion, American garage rock, and Dylanesque singer/songwriters to create a distinctively American hybrid, recalling the past without being indebted to it.The Heartbreakers were a tight, muscular, and versatile backing band that provided the proper support for Petty\\'s songs, which cataloged a series of middle-class losers and dreamers. While his slurred, nasal voice may have resembled Dylan and Roger McGuinn, Petty\\'s songwriting was lean and direct, like the simple, unadorned style of Neil Young. Throughout his career, Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers never departed from their signature rootsy sound, but they were able to expand it, bringing in psychedelic Southern rock and new wave influences; they were also one of the few of the traditionalist rock &amp; rollers who embraced music videos, filming some of the most inventive and popular videos in MTV history. His willingness to experiment with the boundaries of classic rock &amp; roll helped Petty sustain his popularity well into the 21st century.Born and raised in northern Florida, Petty began playing music while he was still in high school. At the age of 17, he dropped out of school to join Mudcrutch, which also featured guitarist Mike Campbell and keyboardist Benmont Tench. By 1970, Mudcrutch had moved to Los Angeles with hopes of finding a record contract. The fledgling Shelter Records, founded by Leon Russell and Denny Cordell, offered the group a contract. However, Mudcrutch splintered apart shortly after relocating to L.A. Cordell was willing to record Petty as a solo act, but the singer\\'s reception to the idea was tentative. Over the next few years, Petty drifted through bands, eventually hooking back up with Campbell and Tench in 1975. At the time, the duo were working with bassist Ron Blair and drummer Stan Lynch; soon, Petty became involved with the band, which was then named the Heartbreakers. Petty was still under contract to Shelter, and the group assumed his deal, releasing Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers in 1976.Initially, the band\\'s debut was ignored in the United States, but when the group supported it in England with a tour opening for Nils Lofgren, the record began to take off. Within a few months, the band was headlining its own British tours and the album was in the U.K. Top 30. Prompted by the record\\'s British success, Shelter pushed the album and the single \"Breakdown\" in the U.S., this time with success; \"Breakdown\" became a Top 40 hit and \"American Girl\" became an album-oriented radio staple. You\\'re Gonna Get It, the Heartbreakers\\' second album, was released in 1978 and it became the group\\'s first American Top 40 record. Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers were poised to break into the big time when they ran into severe record company problems. Shelter\\'s parent company, ABC, was bought by MCA, and Petty attempted to renegotiate his contract with the label. MCA was unwilling to meet most of his demands, and halfway through 1979, he filed for bankruptcy. Soon afterward, he settled into an agreement with MCA, signing with their subsidiary Backstreet Records. Released late in 1979, Damn the Torpedoes was his first release on Backstreet.Damn the Torpedoes was Petty\\'s breakthrough release, earning uniformly excellent reviews, generating the Top Ten hit \"Don\\'t Do Me Like That\" and the number 15 \"Refugee,\" and spending seven weeks at number two on the U.S. charts; it would eventually sell over two million copies. Though he was at a peak of popularity, Petty ran into record company trouble again when he and the Heartbreakers prepared to release Hard Promises, the 1981 follow-up to Damn the Torpedoes. MCA wanted to release the record at the list price of $9.98, which was a high price at the time. Petty refused to comply to their wishes, threatening to withhold the album from the label and organizing a fan protest that forced the company to release the record at $8.98. Hard Promises became a Top Ten hit, going platinum and spawning the hit single \"The Waiting.\" Later that year, Petty produced Del Shannon\\'s comeback album Drop Down and Get Me and wrote \"Stop Draggin\\' My Heart Around\" as a duet for himself and Stevie Nicks. Featured on her album Bella Donna, which was recorded with the Heartbreakers\\' support, \"Stop Draggin\\' My Heart Around\" became a number three hit. Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers returned late in 1982 with Long After Dark, which became their third Top Ten album in a row. Following its release, bassist Ron Blair left the band and was replaced by Howie Epstein, who previously played with John Hiatt.Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers spent nearly three years making Southern Accents, the follow-up to Long After Dark. Hiring Eurythmics\\' Dave Stewart as a producer, the band attempted to branch out musically, reaching into new territories like soul, psychedelia, and new wave. However, the recording wasn\\'t easy -- at its worst, Petty punched a studio wall and broke his left hand, reportedly in frustration over the mixing. Southern Accents was finally released in the spring of 1985, preceded by the neo-psychedelic single \"Don\\'t Come Around Here No More,\" which featured a popular, pseudo-Alice in Wonderland video. Southern Accents was another hit record, peaking at number seven and going platinum. Following its release, Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers spent 1986 on tour as Bob Dylan\\'s backing band. Dylan contributed to the lead single \"Jammin\\' Me,\" from the Heartbreakers\\' next album, Let Me Up (I\\'ve Had Enough), which was released to mixed reviews in the spring of 1987. Just after the record\\'s release, Petty\\'s house and most of his belongings were destroyed by fire; he, his wife, and two daughters survived unscathed.In 1988, Petty became a member of the supergroup the Traveling Wilburys, which also featured Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and Jeff Lynne. The Wilburys released their first album at the end of 1988 and its sound became the blueprint for Petty\\'s first solo effort, 1989\\'s Full Moon Fever. Produced by Lynne and featuring the support of most of the Heartbreakers, Full Moon Fever became Petty\\'s commercial pinnacle, reaching number three on the U.S. charts, going triple platinum, and generating the hit singles \"I Won\\'t Back Down,\" \"Runnin\\' Down a Dream,\" and \"Free Fallin\\',\" which reached number seven. In 1990, he contributed to the Traveling Wilburys\\' second album, Vol. 3. Petty officially reunited with the Heartbreakers on Into the Great Wide Open, which was also produced by Jeff Lynne. Released in the spring of 1991, Into the Great Wide Open sustained the momentum of Full Moon Fever, earning strong reviews and going platinum. Following the release of 1993\\'s Greatest Hits, which featured two new tracks produced by Rick Rubin, including the Top 20 hit \"Mary Jane\\'s Last Dance,\" Petty left MCA for Warner Bros.; upon signing, it was revealed that he negotiated a $20 million deal in 1989. Drummer Stan Lynch left the Heartbreakers in 1994, as Petty was recording his second solo album with producer Rubin and many members of the Heartbreakers. Like Full Moon Fever before it, 1994\\'s Wildflowers was greeted by enthusiastic reviews and sales, tying his previous solo album for his biggest-selling studio album. In addition to going triple platinum and peaking at number eight, the album spawned the hit singles \"You Don\\'t Know How It Feels,\" \"You Wreck Me,\" and \"It\\'s Good to Be King.\" Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers reunited in 1996 to record the soundtrack for the Edward Burns film She\\'s the One. The resulting soundtrack album was a moderate hit, peaking at number 15 on the U.S. charts and going gold. Echo followed three years later, becoming the first Heartbreakers record to make the Top Ten in almost 15 years.The Last DJ, a scathing attack on the corporate greed inherent in the music business, was released in 2002, followed in 2006 by a solo album, Highway Companion; both albums reached the Top Ten, and Highway Companion went gold in the U.S. After this, Petty reunited his original band Mudcrutch for a 2008 album and tour. Mojo, credited to Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, appeared from Reprise in 2010. The band toured fairly regularly over the next four years, then returned in the summer of 2014 with Hypnotic Eye, the first number one album in their career. Two years later, Petty reconvened Mudcrutch for their second album, appropriately entitled 2. On October 2, 2017, Petty was found at his home in cardiac arrest, and he died at a hospital in Santa Monica later that day. Nearly a year later, his family and band released the box set An American Treasure as a tribute to the departed rocker. A double-disc hits collection, The Best of Everything, followed in March 2019. Prior to his death, Petty began work on an expanded reissue of 1994\\'s Wildflowers, restoring it to its original double-album length. His family and collaborators finished the project posthumously, releasing it as the box set Wildflowers....And All the Rest in October 2020. The same team produced a revamped version of Songs and Music from \"She\\'s the One\" that removed the Wildflowers outtakes and added previously unreleased songs. It was retitled Angel Dream and released in July of 2021. Live at the Fillmore 1997, the next major archival release from Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, arrived in November 2022. Documenting the group\\'s 20-night residency at the Fillmore in San Francisco at the start of 1997, the four-CD box set -- released in conjunction with a two-CD distillation -- was filled with covers and obscurities, along with cameos by John Lee Hooker and Roger McGuinn. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Eve emerged as one of a new breed of tough and talented female MCs to hit the rap scene during the late \\'90s, alongside contemporaries Foxy Brown and Lil Kim. As part of the Ruff Ryders posse, she was hard-edged and came off as a strong, no-nonsense street MC who could hold her own with anyone on the mic, finding success on her own terms in the process. Stepping into the spotlight as a solo artist, she issued her 1999 debut Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders\\' First Lady, which topped the Billboard 200. Her 2001 sophomore effort Scorpion peaked at number four and was certified platinum, breaking her on the international stage with hit singles \"Who\\'s That Girl\" and \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind\" enduring as era-defining classics. The latter, featuring Gwen Stefani, won a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in 2002. That same year, her third album Eve-Olution and its respective singles occupied the upper reaches of the Billboard charts, and in 2005, a reciprocal collaboration with Stefani, \"Rich Girl,\" scored the pair another hit. However, a fourth LP would not appear for a decade as Eve was bogged down in label issues and constant setbacks. In 2013, she decided to just do it on her own, issuing Lip Lock.Born Eve Jihan Jeffers in Philadelphia on November 10, 1978, she started out as a singer in her early teens, performing with an all-female vocal quintet. She was also honing her skills as a rapper in impromptu battles with friends, and before she left high school, she formed a female rap duo called EDGP (pronounced \"Egypt\"), adopting the name Gangsta. EDGP performed at local talent shows and club gigs, often to the detriment of Eve\\'s dedication to school. When the group broke up, she went solo and changed her name to Eve of Destruction; she also moved to the Bronx in the wake of her mother\\'s remarriage, and worked for a time as a table dancer at a strip club. Unhappy with this direction, she decided to give rap another shot after being encouraged by Mase.Through some of her friends, Eve scored a meeting with Dr. Dre in Los Angeles, and surprised him by turning it into an audition. Dre liked what he heard and signed her to a one-year deal with his new label, Aftermath. Eve recorded a few tracks, including one, \"Eve of Destruction,\" that ended up on the Bulworth soundtrack in 1998. However, Aftermath was searching for a direction at the time, and Eve wound up lost in the shuffle. Her contract expired without an album even in the works, but fortunately, she\\'d met DMX when the rising new star was in Los Angeles promoting his smash debut It\\'s Dark and Hell Is Hot. Eve passed a battle-rap audition to join DMX\\'s Ruff Ryders posse, and in 1999 she contributed to their label\\'s Ryde or Die, Vol. 1 compilation. Thanks to DMX\\'s star power, it entered the charts at number one, and Eve\\'s track, \"What Ya Want,\" was released as a single. It hit the R&amp;B Top Ten and Eve built up anticipation for her debut album with high-profile guest spots on the Roots\\' \"You Got Me\" and the Blackstreet/Janet Jackson duet \"Girlfriend/Boyfriend.\"Eve\\'s first full-length was titled Let There Be Eve...Ruff Ryders\\' First Lady and released in September 1999. With Ruff Ryders one of the biggest names in rap, the album was an instant smash; it entered the charts at number one -- the first time a female rapper had ever accomplished that feat -- and went on to sell over two-million copies. Eve also scored hits with the R&amp;B Top Ten \"Gotta Man\" and the anti-domestic violence track \"Love Is Blind,\" and guested on Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott\\'s hit \"Hot Boyz.\" After touring in support of the record, Eve returned to the studio and delivered her follow-up, Scorpion, in early 2001. The album received strong reviews and topped the R&amp;B charts while debuting at number four on the pop side. Lead single \"Who\\'s That Girl?\" had some chart success, but it was the follow-up, a duet with No Doubt\\'s Gwen Stefani called \"Let Me Blow Ya Mind,\" that really broke Eve on the pop charts. The song rocketed to number two and went on to win a Grammy in the newly created category of Best Rap/Sung Collaboration; it also helped Scorpion go platinum. Eve next set about establishing a movie career; she made her box-office debut in the Vin Diesel action blockbuster XXX, which was released in the summer of 2002. Not long afterward, she was also seen in a prominent supporting role in the Ice Cube comedy Barbershop. Amid all this activity, Eve released her third album, Eve-Olution, in August 2002. It debuted in the Top Ten and found Eve returning to the soul singing of her youth on a surprising number of tracks. The single \"Gangsta Lovin\\',\" which featured guest vocals from Alicia Keys, was a number two smash on both the pop and R&amp;B charts, and the follow-up \"Satisfaction\" was nominated for a Grammy. In early 2003, Eve signed with the UPN network to produce and star in a multiracial sitcom about a fashion designer, and she continued acting in movies with roles in Barbershop 2, The Cookout, and The Woodsman. A full return to music was attempted in 2007 with Here I Am, an album featuring productions from Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell, but after a couple singles were serviced to radio, the album was shelved by Eve\\'s label Interscope. A starring role in the film Whip It, and a recurring character on the television show Glee kept her busy until 2013 when Lip Lock landed. The album featured guest shots from Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliot, and Juicy J, and was released by Eve\\'s label, From the Rib.As she prepped a follow-up to Lip Lock, she involved herself with television (Sisterhood of Hip Hop and The Talk) and even toured with Stefani in 2016. Eve returned in 2019 with the single \"Reload\" with Konshens. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "'Formed in the late \\'90s, Maryland pop-punk outfit Good Charlotte made their mainstream breakthrough in 2002 with raucous hits \"The Anthem\" and \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" from their sophomore set, The Young and the Hopeless. Influenced by Minor Threat, Rancid, and Green Day, the quintet made a splash on MTV with their youthful, rebellious videos, finding crossover success in both the pop and rock markets with subsequent international Top Ten hits The Chronicles of Life and Death (2004) and Good Morning Revival (2007). As members became fathers and the scene evolved, they embraced their roles as genre vets in the late 2010s, fueling the nostalgic pop-punk revival with 2016\\'s Youth Authority and 2018\\'s Generation Rx. They began the 2020s by collaborating with newer acts like Yung Pinch and Goody Grace as well as issuing their own single \"Last December.\"The band was founded in 1996 by twin brothers Joel and Benji Madden. Inspired by a Beastie Boys performance on their 1995 Ill Communication tour, the Maddens enlisted the help of several high-school classmates in assembling a band that combined the energetic elements spawned from \\'70s punk with the sentimental ballads of mainstream corporate rock. Good Charlotte were soon formed, with Joel Madden handling lead vocals and Benji Madden playing lead guitar. Paul Thomas (bass) and Aaron Escolopio (drums) completed the early lineup, while Billy Martin later joined as a second guitarist.Although the group hailed from the suburban town of Waldorf, Maryland, Good Charlotte quickly made a name for themselves in nearby Washington, D.C., playing the WHFS annual rock show HFStival in 1998 and 1999. A year later, the band issued their spunky self-titled debut on Epic, and the single \"Little Things\" made minor waves. The Madden brothers scored a gig as MTV VJs and soon were all over the network\\'s late-night rock show All Things Rock, which gave their band\\'s profile a boost. The two spent time behind the scenes writing songs for their sophomore album, but Escolopio left the group to join his brother in Wakefield before recording could begin. Josh Freese was quickly enlisted as the band\\'s temporary drummer (Chris Wilson would later replace him permanently). By the fall of 2002, Good Charlotte prepared to release The Young and the Hopeless, and their expanded audience was ready. Singles \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\" and \"Anthem\" catapulted the group into the mainstream in 2003 and eventually drove the album into triple-platinum sales; shared dates with New Found Glory for the third annual Honda Civic Tour were equally successful. In 2004, Good Charlotte returned with The Chronicles of Life and Death, which hit number three on the Billboard charts but failed to sell as well as their previous album. Wilson exited the band in mid-2005 citing health reasons, and later went on to join the Summer Obsession. Dean Butterworth (who had previously drummed for Morrissey, among others) joined up in time for sessions for the crew\\'s fourth album, which were held in Vancouver and away from the Madden-loving paparazzi (especially Joel and his then-girlfriend Hilary Duff). The much more varied Good Morning Revival appeared in late March 2007, spearheaded by the single \"The River,\" which featured M. Shadows and Synyster Gates of Avenged Sevenfold. In 2009, the bandmembers announced that they were returning both to the studio and their punk roots. The group\\'s fifth album, Cardiology, was released in 2010. The set peaked at 31 on the charts and Good Charlotte went on hiatus. The Madden Brothers released a soft rock solo project called Greetings from California in 2014, and the pair reconvened Good Charlotte for 2016\\'s Youth Authority. In December 2017, the band released a tribute cover of late rapper Lil Peep\\'s \"Awful Things.\" A full-length album, Generation Rx, appeared in September 2018. Produced by Benji Madden and Zakk Cervini, the LP fared better in Europe and Australia than the U.S., entering the Top 40 in the U.K. and spawning the singles \"Actual Pain\" and \"Prayers.\"Kicking off a new decade, the group joined Yung Pinch and Goody Grace on \"Hanging with Ghosts\" before returning with their own single \"Last December\" at the end of 2020. ~ MacKenzie Wilson, Rovi'\n",

      "'An English hard rock institution founded by former Deep Purple vocalist David Coverdale, Whitesnake emerged in the late 1970s with a style steeped in the driving British blues-rock of bands like Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppelin, and of course, Deep Purple. After recalibrating their sound to better adapt to the burgeoning \\'80s hair and pop-metal scene, they found commercial success with 1984\\'s Slide It In and then cannonballed into the mainstream in 1987 with the release of their multi-platinum-selling eponymous seventh effort, which spawned the power ballad \"Is This Love\" and the massive crossover number one hit \"Here I Go Again.\" Whitesnake weathered the onslaught of grunge and alternative rock for as long as they could but eventually ceased operations in the early \\'90s. A one-off studio album, Restless Heart, appeared in 1997, but the group didn\\'t officially re-form until 2002. Since then, Coverdale and company have released a string of well-received studio albums, including 2008\\'s Good to Be Bad and 2011\\'s Forevermore; the former hit number seven on the U.K. Albums Chart. In 2019, they celebrated their Deep Purple roots with the covers-based The Purple Album and again cracked the U.K. Top Ten with 2019\\'s Flesh &amp; Blood. They also released a trilogy of retrospective anthologies, 2020\\'s Love Songs, 2020\\'s The Rock Album, and 2021\\'s The Blues Album, detailing their legacy at the nexus of commercial hard rock, pop, and heavy metal. Yorkshire native David Coverdale honed his powerful vocals in local groups in the late \\'60s and early \\'70s, so when he saw that Deep Purple was looking for a replacement for the recently departed Ian Gillian, he jumped at the chance to audition. He officially joined the band in 1973 and made his first studio appearance on the group\\'s gold-selling 1974 effort Burn. He stayed on for two more albums, Stormbringer (1974) and Come Taste the Band (1975), the latter of which marked the beginning of an eight-year hiatus for the group and the dawn of a new era for Coverdale. In 1977, he released his debut solo effort, White Snake, with Northwinds arriving the following year. Both LPs featured a core backing group consisting of Mick Moody (guitar), Bernie Marsden (guitar), Neil Murray (bass), and Dave Dowle (drums) operating under the moniker The White Snake Band, which Coverdale officially shortened to Whitesnake for the 1978 EP Snakebite. The EP featured a brooding cover version of Bobby \"Blue\" Bland\\'s \"Ain\\'t No Love in the Heart of the City,\" which became the newly minted group\\'s first hit. Continuing in the blues-rock style of its predecessor, the full-length Trouble arrived later that year and saw Coverdale reunite with former Deep Purple bandmate keyboardist Jon Lord. 1979\\'s Lovehunter courted controversy with its lurid cover art created by fantasy artist Chris Achilleos, but still managed to reach the number 29 slot on the U.K. Albums Charts. It also marked the end of the road for kitman Dave Dowle, who was replaced by another ex-Deep Purple member, Ian Paice; Paice made his studio debut on 1980\\'s Ready an\\' Willing. The group\\'s most successful effort to date, the LP peaked at number six in the U.K. and entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 on the strength of the fiery single \"Fool for Your Loving.\" Fan favorite Come and Get It, released in 1981, brought Whitesnake even closer to the mainstream, securing the number two slot on the U.K. albums charts and finding favor with European audiences as well, but momentum stalled the following year while Coverdale took some personal time off to look after his daughter, who was battling bacterial meningitis. A new iteration of the group reconvened in 1982 and saw Marsden, Paice, and Murray replaced by guitarist Mel Galley from Trapeze, bassist Colin Hodgkinson, and drummer Cozy Powell, all of whom appeared on that year\\'s Saints &amp; Sinners.. The album spawned the U.K. hits \"Guilty of Love\" and \"Here I Go Again,\" the latter of which would find new life in 1987 when it was re-recorded for the band\\'s eponymous seventh outing. Whitesnake beefed up their sound for 1984\\'s Slide It In, which featured the hits \"Slow an\\' Easy\" and \"Love Ain\\'t No Stranger\" and became their fourth Top Ten album in the U.K. It also found favor in the U.S. thanks to a more muscular remix by producer David Geffen and featuring guitarist John Sykes, and would later go double-platinum following the massive success of the group\\'s next LP. Having largely ignored the American market in the past, Coverdale elected to relocate to the States, where he assembled a new version of the group that featured Sykes on both rhythm and lead guitars, Murray, drummer Aynsley Dunbar, and keyboardist Don Airey from the Ozzy Osbourne band and Rainbow. Applying ample amounts of studio sheen, the band emerged from the studio in 1987 with the career-defining Whitesnake, a commercial juggernaut that struck a balance between powerful rockers (\"Here I Go Again,\" \"Still of the Night\") and sultry power ballads (\"Is This Love\"). The LP was certified eight-times-platinum in the U.S., with the singles and their accompanying videos becoming near-ubiquitous by the end of the year; they starred actress Tawny Kitaen, who was briefly married to Coverdale and featured guitarists Vivian Campbell and Adrian Vandenberg miming Sykes\\' guitar parts; the latter, along with the rest of the band, had been fired prior to filming. Now arena headliners, Whitesnake headed into 1988 with a full head of steam, but creative differences led to the departure of Vivian Campbell and a serious wrist injury forced Adrian Vandenberg to step back for a time, leaving Coverdale to once again assemble a new team. He managed to enlist Frank Zappa and David Lee Roth guitar phenom Steve Vai, who along with a rehabilitated Vandenberg, made for a formidable six-string duo. Bolstered by the addition of bassist Rudy Sarzo (Quiet Riot) and drummer Tommy Aldridge (Ozzy Osbourne), the group released Slip of the Tongue in 1989, which reached platinum status and included the hits \"The Deeper the Love\" and a new version of \"Fool for Your Loving.\" Upon completing the tour in support of the album, Coverdale announced that Whitesnake had run its course, and that he would be taking a break from music. During this time, Vandenberg, Sarzo, and Aldridge formed a new group, Manic Eden, while Coverdale began working with former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, resulting in the 1993 release Coverdale-Page. A new Whitesnake lineup emerged in 1994 to tour in support of a recently issued Greatest Hits LP, and in 1997 Coverdale teamed up with Vandenberg for a solo effort, but the record company persuaded the pair to release the bluesy, R&amp;B-based Restless Heart under the Whitesnake moniker. While on tour, Coverdale and Vandenberg performed an intimate acoustic show in Japan that was later released as Starkers in Tokyo, but by the end of 1997, Coverdale had once again put the band into hibernation, where it would stay for the next five years. Whitesnake re-formed in 2003 as a touring entity to celebrate their 25th anniversary with a lineup consisting of Coverdale, guitarists Doug Aldrich (Dio) and Reb Beach (Winger), bass player Marco Mendoza, drummer Tommy Aldridge, and keyboard player Timothy Drury. In 2006 the band inked a deal with Steamhammer/SPV Records and released a double-live LP, Live: In the Shadow of the Blues, with an all-new studio album Good to be Bad, arriving two years later, which swapped out Mendoza for bassist Uriah Duffy and Aldridge for drummer Chris Frazier. Experiencing voice issues resulting from severe vocal-fold edema and a left vocal-fold vascular lesion, Coverdale spent the next few years recuperating but returned in 2011 to helm the band\\'s well-received 11th studio effort Forevermore, which was released via Frontiers. 2015\\'s The Purple Album saw the band re-record a set of Coverdale-era Deep Purple songs. Digging deep into their recorded work, Whitesnake issued Unzipped in 2018, which collected rare and unreleased acoustic performances recorded over two decades. It was followed in early 2019 by the band\\'s 13th long-player, Flesh &amp; Blood, which hit number seven on the U.K. albums chart and cracked the Billboard 200. They also released a trilogy of themed retrospective anthologies including 2020\\'s Love Songs, 2020\\'s The Rock Album, and 2021\\'s The Blues Album. ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi'\n",

      "'Despite a huge hit single in the mid-\\'70s (\"The Boys Are Back in Town\") and becoming a popular act with hard rock/heavy metal fans, Thin Lizzy are still, in the pantheon of \\'70s rock bands, underappreciated. Formed in the late \\'60s by Irish singer/songwriter/bassist Phil Lynott, Lizzy, though not the first band to do so, combined romanticized working-class sentiments with their ferocious, twin-lead guitar attack. As the band\\'s creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition. Also, as a Black man, Lynott was an anomaly in the nearly all-white world of hard rock, and as such imbued much of his work with a sense of alienation; he was the outsider, the romantic guy from the other side of the tracks, a self-styled poet of the lovelorn and downtrodden. His sweeping vision and writerly impulses at times gave way to pretentious songs aspiring to clichéd notions of literary significance, but Lynott\\'s limitless charisma made even the most misguided moments worth hearing.After a few early records that hinted at the band\\'s potential, Lizzy released Fighting in 1975, and the band (Lynott, guitarists Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham, and drummer Brian Downey) had molded itself into a pretty tight recording and performing unit. Lynott\\'s thick, soulful vocals were the perfect vehicle for his tightly written melodic lines. Gorham and Robertson generally played lead lines in harmonic tandem, while Downey (a great drummer who had equal amounts of power and style) drove the engine. Lizzy\\'s big break came with their next album, Jailbreak, and the record\\'s first single, \"The Boys Are Back in Town.\" A paean to the joys of working-class guys letting loose, the song resembled similar odes by Bruce Springsteen, with the exception of the Who-like power chords in the chorus. With the support of radio and every frat boy in America, \"Boys\" became a huge hit, enough of a hit as to ensure record contracts and media attention for the next decade (\"Boys\" is now used in beer advertising).Never the toast of critics (the majority writing in the \\'70s hated hard rock and heavy metal), Lizzy toured relentlessly, building an unassailable reputation as a terrific live band, despite the lead guitar spot becoming a revolving door (Eric Bell, Gary Moore, Brian Robertson, Snowy White, and John Sykes all stood next to Scott Gorham). The records came fast and furious, and despite attempts to repeat the formula that worked like a charm with \"Boys,\" Lynott began writing more ambitious songs and wrapping them up in vaguely articulated concept albums. The large fan base the band had built as a result of \"Boys\" turned into a smaller, yet still enthusiastic bunch of hard rockers. Adding insult to injury was the rise of punk rock, which Lynott vigorously supported, but made Lizzy look too traditional and too much like tired old rock stars.By the mid-\\'80s, resembling the dinosaur that punk rock wanted to annihilate, Thin Lizzy called it a career. Lynott recorded solo records that more explicitly examined issues of class and race, published a now-out-of-print book of poetry, and sadly, became a victim of his longtime abuse of heroin, cocaine, and alcohol, dying in 1986 at age 35. Since the mega-popular alternative rock bands of the mid-\\'90s appropriated numerous musical messages from their \\'70s forebears, the work of Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy will hopefully continue to be seen for the influential rock &amp; roll it is.In 1999, Thin Lizzy reunited with a lineup featuring guitarists Scott Gorman and John Sykes, and keyboardist Darren Wharton, which was rounded out by a journeyman rhythm section of bassist Marco Mendoza and drummer Tommy Aldridge. The quintet\\'s ensuing European tour produced the live album One Night Only, which was released in the summer of 2000 to set the stage for a subsequent American concert tour. ~ John Dougan, Rovi'\n",

      "'By bringing style, fun, and catchy songwriting back to rock music, the Strokes became one of the most influential bands of the early 21st century. Their direct, hooky sound -- equally inspired by classic tunesmiths like Buddy Holly and the brash attitude of fellow New Yorkers the Velvet Underground and Ramones -- set trends even as it looked back on rock history. With their acclaimed 2001 debut, Is This It, the Strokes reinvigorated a rock scene that had spent years focused on post-grunge and nu-metal. Along with the White Stripes and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, they helped shape the sound and look of alternative rock in the 2000s, with Kings of Leon, the Killers, and the Libertines, Franz Ferdinand, and Arctic Monkeys reflecting their impact in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively. As the decade unfolded, the Strokes embellished on their back-to-basics style, adding new wave and synth pop elements to 2003\\'s Room on Fire and 2006\\'s ambitious First Impressions of Earth, a trend they continued with later releases like 2013\\'s Comedown Machine. Though they spent much of the 2010s working on individual projects, they returned with some of their most passionate-sounding music on 2020\\'s The New Abnormal. The Strokes\\' roots go back to the late \\'90s. Singer/songwriter Julian Casablancas (the son of Elite Model Agency Group kingpin John Casablancas), drummer Fabrizio Moretti (who began playing drums at age five), and guitarist Nick Valensi started playing together in 1997 while they attended the Dwight School, a private prep school in Manhattan. Soon thereafter, they met bassist Nikolai Fraiture, who attended the Upper East Side\\'s Lycée Français, and added him to their ranks. At the time, the then-unnamed band\\'s musical influences included the Doors, Bob Marley, the Velvet Underground, and Jane\\'s Addiction. In 1998, guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. (the son of singer/songwriter Albert Hammond, whose songs include \"It Never Rains in Southern California,\" \"When I Need You,\" and \"To All the Girls I\\'ve Loved Before\") came from Los Angeles to attend film school at NYU and was invited into the band by Casablancas; the two had met at L\\'Institut le Rosey in Switzerland when they were kids. With the addition of Hammond, Jr., the band\\'s style coalesced into a punk-, new wave-, and garage-inspired sound, and Casablancas officially christened the quintet the Strokes in 1999. The group spent most of that year writing and rehearsing material in New York City\\'s Music Building. They played their first gig at the Spiral, and word of mouth about the Strokes\\' incendiary live show propelled them to gigs at venues like Under the Acme and Lower East Side clubs such as Arlene Grocery, Baby Jupiter, and Luna. The Strokes\\' December 2000 dates at the Mercury Lounge and the Bowery Ballroom not only gained them a manager (Ryan Gentles, who booked them at those clubs) but also helped Strokes mania reach critical mass in New York.To record their three-song demo, the Strokes enlisted Gordon Raphael, starting a long-running creative partnership. Rough Trade released the group\\'s three-song demo as The Modern Age EP in January 2001, which sparked a bidding war from which RCA emerged as the victor. Meanwhile, the Strokes\\' acclaim reached the U.K. and grew to massive proportions over the course of the year, with singles like \"Hard to Explain\" (which debuted at number 16 in the U.K. charts) winning them a rabid British following. A side-stage slot at the NME Carling Weekender was changed to a main-stage performance for fear of people trampling each other to see the band.When the Strokes began work on their debut album, the initial sessions included Gil Norton, but creative differences with the Pixies producer led the band to reunite with Raphael. Working in the East Village\\'s Transporterraum studio, Raphael and the Strokes recorded Is This It over the course of March and April 2001, adopting a compressed, back-to-basics sound that borrowed production techniques used by the Velvet Underground and Ramones. Released in Australia in July 2001 and in the U.K. that August, Is This It originally featured a Helmut Newton-esque photo of a woman\\'s nude behind and hip with a leather-gloved hand resting on it; the U.K. chains Woolworths and HMV objected to its controversial nature, but continued to sell the album. The North American version of Is This It appeared in October 2001 with a few changes: The Strokes opted for a picture of particle collisions in the Big European Bubble Chamber on the cover and removed the track \"New York City Cops,\" feeling the song was inappropriate in the wake of the terrorist attacks that struck New York prior to the album\\'s release; the planned B-side, \"When It Started,\" took its place. Is This It earned widespread critical acclaim and strong sales, reaching number two on the U.K. Albums Chart and number 33 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart in the U.S. Over time, it achieved platinum status in countries including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Canada, and Australia. The album also spawned the hit singles \"Last Nite\" and \"Someday.\" The Strokes\\' profile continued to rise for the remainder of 2001 and into 2002. Is This It and the band were lauded in many ways, ranging from This Isn\\'t It, an EP of instrumental versions of some of the album\\'s songs performed by a mystery band called the Diff\\'rent Strokes to 2001 NME Carling Awards for Best New Act, Band of the Year, and Album of the Year. The band also won a Brit Award for Best International Newcomer and were nominated for the Best International Group Award. They toured extensively throughout 2002, including a series of dates that summer in New York and Detroit with the White Stripes and summer festivals at Reading and Leeds. During these shows and their dates opening for the Rolling Stones, the Strokes debuted songs they\\'d been writing, including \"Meet Me in the Bathroom,\" \"You Talk Way Too Much,\" and \"The Way It Is.\" After finishing their touring commitments in 2002, the Strokes started work on their second album. At first, they worked with renowned producer Nigel Godrich before reuniting with Raphael in May 2003. Recorded in three months, Room on Fire arrived in October 2003 with a slightly smoother sound that brought out the new wave elements of the Strokes\\' music. The album built on Is This It\\'s success, reaching number four on the Billboard 200 and number two on the U.K. Album Charts. In the U.S., it achieved gold status and went platinum in the U.K. and Australia. The Strokes toured for much of 2004 and returned to the studio for album number three in early 2005. They began the sessions with Raphael, but eventually completed the album with Grammy-winning producer David Kahne. Preceded by the grunge-influenced single \"Juicebox,\" which became a Top Ten hit in the U.S. and U.K., First Impressions of Earth appeared in January 2006. A more experimental and eclectic effort than the Strokes\\' first two albums, it became the band\\'s first chart-topping album in the U.K. and made the Top Five of the album charts in Canada and the U.S. Once the First Impressions of Earth tour was finished, the Strokes went on hiatus, with each member working on other projects. Albert Hammond, Jr. was the first to venture into the solo fray with Yours to Keep, which was released in late 2006 in the U.K. and in early 2007 in the U.S.; he followed it with 2008\\'s Como Te Llama? Fabrizio Moretti played with the indie pop band Little Joy, whose self-titled album arrived in late 2008. Nikolai Fraiture embarked on the folky solo project Nickel Eye, and released the debut Time of the Assassins in early 2009. During this time, Casablancas collaborated with other artists, playing Casio guitar on \"Sick, Sick, Sick\" from Queens of the Stone Age\\'s 2007 album Era Vulgaris and collaborating with Santigold and Pharrell on the song \"My Drive Thru\" for a 2008 Converse Shoes ad campaign. He also recorded with the Lonely Island, Danger Mouse, and Sparklehorse. At the beginning of 2009, Casablancas and Valensi began work on the Strokes\\' fourth album. Progress was slow, however, and Casablancas released his debut solo album, Phrazes for the Young, in October of that year. In 2010, the band collaborated with producer Joe Chiccarelli on some tracks, but they ultimately worked with producer and engineer Gus Oberg at Hammond, Jr.\\'s home studio on the majority of what would become Angles. Arriving in March 2011, the album took cues from MGMT, Crystal Castles, and other synth-heavy bands, and, for the first time on a Strokes album, featured backing vocals. Angles was a Top Five hit in the U.S. and U.K., and became the band\\'s first album to hit number one in Australia. The record\\'s lead single \"Under Cover of Darkness\" reached number 12 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. In contrast to Angles\\' lengthy creative process, the Strokes started making their fifth album in 2012. Working once again with Oberg, this time at Manhattan\\'s Electric Lady studio, the group also continued Angles\\' collaborative songwriting on March 2013\\'s Comedown Machine, a more streamlined, subdued affair that reunited the band with Angles producer Gus Oberg. The members of the Strokes then spent a couple of years pursuing individual projects: Casablancas formed the Voidz, whose politically minded debut album, Tyranny, arrived in 2014. That year, Valensi contributed to Brody Dalle\\'s album Diploid Love, and Hammond, Jr. released his third solo album, Momentary Masters, in 2015. The group reunited in 2016 for a string of shows and Future Present Past, their first EP in 15 years and their first on Casablancas\\' Cult Records. New Skin, the debut album from Valensi\\'s band CRX, also appeared that year.Along with playing several festivals, the Strokes started mapping out their sixth album with producer Rick Rubin in 2017. As they worked on material for it, Casablancas and his other band the Voidz issued the album Virtue in 2018, while Hammond, Jr. released the Oberg-produced Francis Trouble. Preceded by shows including a 2019 New Year\\'s Eve concert in Brooklyn and a February 2020 rally for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, The New Abnormal arrived in 2020 and introduced a more thoughtful and confessional level to the Strokes\\' sound and songwriting. Recorded in California and Hawaii, the album was a critical and commercial success, becoming a Top Ten hit in several countries including the U.S. and the U.K. In 2021, The New Abnormal won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards. In February 2023, the Strokes issued The Singles, Vol. 1, a collection of singles and B-sides from the band\\'s first three albums. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi'\n",

      "'Prefabricated punks who later became globe-conquering superstars, the Police played a pivotal part in bringing New Wave into the pop mainstream. Rooted in reggae and flirting with punk, the Police also dabbled in jazz, worldbeat, and atmospheric instrumentals that nodded toward new age music, a combination that made the trio one of the most distinctive bands of their era. They were also one of the most commercially successful groups of the late 1970s and early \\'80s, appealing to album rock, Top 40, and MTV audiences in equal measure, building a repertoire filled with pop/rock staples, including \"Roxanne,\" \"Message in a Bottle,\" \"Don\\'t Stand So Close to Me,\" \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,\" and \"Every Breath You Take,\" the blockbuster that spent eight weeks at number one in 1983. \"Every Breath You Take\" and its accompanying album Synchronicity served as a career-capping moment for the band. The volatile internal chemistry between vocalist/bassist Sting, drummer Stewart Copeland, and guitarist Andy Summers turned combustible in the wake of Synchronicity, leading the Police to disband at the peak of their popularity. They left behind an enduring body of work, one which they celebrated with a reunion tour in 2007. Sting, a teacher born Gordon Sumner who moonlighted playing jazz bass in Newcastle, first crossed paths with Stewart Copeland when the drummer was playing with the prog rock band Curved Air. At the time Curved Air passed through Newcastle, Sting was part of Last Exit, a jazz-fusion band who released the single \"Whispering Voices\" on the indie imprint Wudwink in 1975. The single caught the ear of Carol Wilson, who was working for the publishing division of Virgin Records \\' Richard Branson. Buoyed by this attention, the group moved to London but they fell apart shortly after this relocation. While some of his bandmates headed back to Newcastle, Sting stayed in London, seeking out Copeland in hopes of a collaboration. As it happened, Curved Air had just split, so the pair joined forces with the intent of breaking into London\\'s thriving punk scene.Adding guitarist Henri Padovani, Sting and Copeland formed a nascent version of the Police. By March 1, 1977, they played their first gig and by May, they released the \"Fall Out\"/\"Nothing Achieving\" single on Illegal Records, an imprint co-founded by Copeland\\'s brother Miles; both sides of the 45 were written by Stewart. Around the time the \"Fall Out\" single hit the stores, Mike Howlett -- a bassist who had just left the prog rock outfit Gong -- invited Sting to join him and guitarist Andy Summers, a veteran of a latter-day incarnation of the Animals and an early version of Soft Machine, to play in a group called Strontium 90. Howlett planned to bring drummer Chris Cutler, a veteran of the challenging Henry Cow, into the fold but he had other commitments, so Sting drafted Copeland as the group\\'s drummer. During the early summer of 1977, Strontium 90 recorded a demo and played a pair of concerts, including a debut at a Gong reunion show in Paris. Despite this activity, Strontium 90 dissolved quickly and Sting asked Summers to join the Police. The Police briefly existed as a quartet with both Summers and Padovani, but by August the new recruit insisted that he be the group\\'s only guitarist. Shortly afterward, Padovani was dismissed and the Police became a trio.The Police began gigging in earnest late in 1977, but the group found it difficult to build an audience. Strapped for cash, they agreed to play in a commercial for Wrigley\\'s gum, dying their hair blond as part of the agreement. Although the spot never aired, the commercial wound up giving the group their distinctive bleached-blond look. Not long afterward, Copeland\\'s brother Miles underwrote the recording of the band\\'s debut, Outlandos d\\'Amour. Seeing potential in \"Roxanne,\" Miles became the Police\\'s manager and secured the group a deal with A&amp;M Records.Miles Copeland managed to stir up some controversy regarding the single release of \"Roxanne\" and its successor \"Can\\'t Stand Losing You.\" Upon its April 1978 release, \"Roxanne\" never made it onto the BBC\\'s playlists, which Miles spun into the single being \"Banned from the BBC\" -- a label that stretched the truth but was slapped onto the initial singles of \"Roxanne.\" Despite this commotion, it didn\\'t chart. \"Can\\'t Stand Losing You\" wound up getting banned from the BBC due to the single\\'s cover art -- a tongue-in-cheek depiction of suicide by hanging -- and the Police parlayed that into a modest 42 placement on the U.K. charts in late summer 1978. \"So Lonely,\" the group\\'s third single, didn\\'t chart at all.Britain may not have been paying attention to the band, but they were gaining traction in North America. \"Roxanne\" wound up cracking the Top 40 in both the U.S. and Canada in early 1979, which at that time was a rarity for punk bands. The stateside success was enough to get \"Roxanne\" re-released in the U.K., where it went to 12, followed by a number two placement for the re-release of \"Can\\'t Stand Losing You.\" With some chart momentum on their side -- they were popular enough to have a re-release of \"Fall Out\" scrape the U.K. singles chart -- the Police embarked on an extensive American tour, completing a new album in the meantime. Entitled Reggatta de Blanc, their second album went to number one upon its October 1979 release, partially on the strength of the number one singles \"Message in a Bottle\" and \"Walking on the Moon.\" Neither single charted in the U.S. Top 40 -- the latter made it all the way to 74 -- but Regatta de Blanc still climbed to number 25 on the Billboard Top 200, while its title track snagged the group their first Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.The Police scored another U.K. hit in February 1980 when \"So Lonely\" reached six upon its re-release, but the year is better remembered as the group\\'s international breakthrough thanks to Zenyatta Mondatta. Delivered in October 1980, the record reached number one in the U.K. and number five in the U.S., with its first single, \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da Da,\" becoming the group\\'s first American Top Ten hit; in the U.K., it was the record\\'s second single, reaching number five. \"Don\\'t Stand So Close to Me,\" released as Zenyatta Mondatta\\'s first single in the U.K. and as its second in the U.S., eclipsed its companion, reaching number one in the U.K. and a Duo or Group With Vocal. \"Behind My Camel,\" an album track from Zenyatta Mondatta, also earned the trio the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance that year.High on their chart success, the Police headed to Montserrat to record their fourth album with producer Hugh Padgham. The resulting Ghost in the Machine appeared in the fall of 1981, topping the U.K. charts and scaling its way to number two in the U.S. The rise of Ghost in the Machine was fueled by \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,\" a Top Ten hit throughout the world which was also a staple on MTV. \"Spirits in the Material World\" was another international hit, reaching 11 in the U.S. and 12 in the U.K., while \"Invisible Sun\" reached number two in the U.K. Ghost in the Machine also increased the Police\\'s presence on album rock radio, as evidenced by \"Secret Journey\" reaching 46 in the U.S.During the reign of Ghost in the Machine, the individual members of the Police seized the opportunities brought by success. Sting resumed the acting career he attempted to launch in 1979, when he appeared in Franc Roddam\\'s silver screen adaptation of the Who\\'s rock opera Quadrophenia. He appeared in the film Brimstone and Treacle -- its soundtrack featured three new Police songs, including the simmering \"I Burn for You\" -- and had a key role in David Lynch\\'s 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert\\'s Dune. Copeland was also drawn to Hollywood, composing the score for Francis Ford Coppola\\'s Rumble Fish. Meanwhile, Summers collaborated with Robert Fripp for the 1982 LP I Advance Masked.All this success was dwarfed by Synchronicity, the 1983 album that turned into a multi-million blockbuster. Much of that success was due to \"Every Breath You Take,\" an ominous ballad that topped the charts in both the U.S. and U.K. \"Every Breath You Take\" became an instant standard, winning the Grammy for Song of the Year along with Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. BMI would later name \"Every Breath You Take\" its most performed song, as it racked up over 15 million radio plays. The ballad wasn\\'t the only hit on Synchronicity. \"Wrapped Around Your Finger\" and \"King of Pain\" both reached the Top 10 in the U.S. -- the former only went to 17 in the U.K. -- and \"Synchronicity II\" turned into a hit on MTV and the radio, peaking at 16 on the Top 40; \"Synchronicity II\" also took home the Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group.Synchronicity dominated 1983, spending 17 weeks on the top of the U.S. charts, vying for the position with Michael Jackson\\'s Thriller. The Police supported the album with a stadium tour that spilled into 1984, but Sting started to grow restless with the trio. Following the tour\\'s completion in March 1984, the group went on hiatus. Sting turned his attention to recording his debut, The Dream of the Blue Turtles with a group of jazz musicians featuring Branford Marsalis, Kenny Kirkland, and Omar Hakim. In America, \"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\" and \"Fortress Around Your Heart\" gave Sting two Top Ten hits, while \"Love Is the Seventh Wave\" and \"Russians\" charted at 17 and 16 on Billboard\\'s Top 40, respectively, helping make Sting was inescapable throughout 1985. He sang the \"I want my MTV\" refrain on Dire Straits\\' smash hit \"Money for Nothing,\" he cameoed on records by Phil Collins, Miles Davis, and Arcadia alike, he appeared on Hal Willner\\'s Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill tribute album and he took his Dream of the Blue Turtles out on the road on a tour that was captured on Michael Apted\\'s documentary Bring on the Night, which was released toward the end of the year. The Police reconvened in June 1986 to play three concerts on the Amnesty International: A Conspiracy of Hope tour, which led to the group attempting to record a new album that July. Prior to heading into the studio, Copeland broke his collarbone in a horse-riding accident. The injury exacerbated simmering tensions within the group and the trio wound up completing just one track: a new version of \"Don\\'t Stand So Close to Me.\" Attached as a new track on the 1986 compilation Every Breath You Take: The Singles, and the song was a modest hit. Following its release, the band separated, this time for good.Over the next two decades, the paths of the Police would occasionally cross. Andy Summers would play with Sting both on record and on-stage, while the entire trio reunited for an impromptu performance at Sting\\'s 1992 wedding to Trudie Styler. The group reunited in 2003, when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, planting the seed for the Police\\'s full-fledged reunion tour of 2007-2008. The reunion, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2008, featured an appearance by their original guitarist Henri Padovani and culminated in an August 2008 show at Madison Square Garden. Certifiable: Live in Buenos Aires, a combination video and CD set documenting the group\\'s reunion tour, appeared in November 2008, closing the book on the Police\\'s reunion and career. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'A Grammy- and Latin Grammy-winning five-piece band from Mexico with a hook-laden, psychedelic rock style and infectious rock and pop songs, Zoé are regarded as one of the most important groups of the indie rock era. The band rose to the top of the rock en español scene during the late 2000s, and their third album, the chart-topping breakout smash Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón Atómico de la Vía Láctea (2006), earned them an array of award nominations and the first of many Premio Oye! wins. In 2011, they won three Latin Grammys. They took home prizes for Best Alternative Album, Best Long Form Video for the album MTV Unplugged/Música de Fondo, and Rock Song of the Year for the live version of the song \"Labios Rotos.\" In 2018, they won another Grammy for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album for Aztlán, a sweeping, lush collection of romantic psychedelic pop and sociologically topical songs. Founded in Mexico City in 1994, Zoé underwent a few years of lineup changes before solidifying into a quintet comprised of León Larregui (vocals/songwriting), Sergio Acosta (lead guitar), Jesús Báez (keyboards), Angel Mosqueda (bass), and Beto Cabrera (drums). In association with Sony Music, Zoé made their eponymous full-length debut in 2001. The album was largely unsuccessful despite the release of multiple singles. Looking to a make a change with their second album, the band got together with Phil Vinall, who had mixed their full-length debut. A veteran British producer whose credits include albums by Placebo, Gene, and the Auteurs, in addition to work with Radiohead, Elastica, and Pulp, Vinall\\'s experience in the mid-\\'90s British scene was well-suited to the group\\'s alternative rock influences. Zoé\\'s second album, Rocanlover (2003), was an improvement over the first, with the band\\'s style more fully realized. After a few years of modest if not major success, Zoé and Sony Music parted ways. In 2005, faced with limited resources, the group put out The Room, an independently released eight-track EP featuring the smash-hit single \"Dead.\" In association with EMI and once again with Vinall in the production seat, Zoé skyrocketed to the top of the rock en español scene in 2006 with their critically acclaimed third album, Memo Rex Commander y el Corazón Atómico de la Vía Láctea. Similar in style and likewise impressive, the certified platinum follow-up effort Reptilectric (2008) was another blockbuster hit. An MTV Unplugged album titled Música de Fondo arrived in 2011, followed by the experimental Prográmaton, their fifth studio long-player, in 2013. The concert LP called 8.11.14 followed two years later. In 2017, the band were the subject of the documentary film Zoé: Panoramas, for which they also released an accompanying soundtrack. In the aftermath, Zoé took a short hiatus as lead vocalist León Larregui issued Metrópolis, his third solo album. After headlining and international festival tours of Spain, Mexico, and the U.S., the group immediately returned to the studio. Zoé released the single \"Azul\" on March 1, 2018. Two more singles, \"Temor y Temblor\" and \"Clarividad,\" followed before the April 20 release of the full-length Aztlán, which was again produced by Vinall. Critics and fans alike responded with enthusiasm to the band\\'s back-to-psychedelia approach. The set was certified gold, and nominated for three Latin Grammys for Best Alternative Song (\"Azul\"), Best Long Form Video (\"Panoramas\"), and Best Alternative Music Album. In 2019, Aztlán won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. ~ Jason Birchmeier, Rovi'\n",

      "'From their first hit in 1974 through their heyday in the \\'80s, Daryl Hall and John Oates\\' smooth, catchy take on Philly soul brought them enormous commercial success -- including six number one singles and six platinum albums. Hall &amp; Oates\\' music was remarkably well constructed and produced; at their best, their songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them, incorporating elements of new wave and hard rock.Daryl Hall began performing professionally while he was a student at Temple University. In 1966, he recorded a single with Kenny Gamble and the Romeos; the group featured Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell, who would all become the architects of Philly soul. During this time, Hall frequently appeared on sessions for Gamble and Huff. In 1967, Hall met John Oates, a fellow Temple University student. Oates was leading his own soul band at the time. The two students realized they had similar tastes and began performing together in an array of R&amp;B and doo wop groups. By 1968, the duo had parted ways, as Oates transferred schools and Hall formed the soft rock band Gulliver; the group released one album on Elektra in the late \\'60s before disbanding.After Gulliver\\'s breakup, Hall concentrated on session work again, appearing as a backup vocalist for the Stylistics, the Delfonics, and the Intruders, among others. Oates returned to Philadelphia in 1969, and he and Hall began writing folk-oriented songs and performing together. Eventually they came to the attention of Tommy Mottola, who quickly became their manager, securing the duo a contract with Atlantic Records. On their first records -- Whole Oates (1972), Abandoned Luncheonette (1973), War Babies (1974) -- the duo were establishing their sound, working with producers like Arif Mardin and Todd Rundgren and removing much of their folk influences. At the beginning of 1974, the duo relocated from Philadelphia to New York. During this period, they only managed one hit -- the number 60 \"She\\'s Gone\" in the spring of 1974.After they moved to RCA in 1975, the duo landed on its successful mixture of soul, pop, and rock, scoring a Top Ten single with \"Sara Smile.\" The success of \"Sara Smile\" prompted the re-release of \"She\\'s Gone,\" which rocketed into the Top Ten as well. Released in the summer of 1976, Bigger than the Both of Us was only moderately successful upon its release. The record took off in early 1977, when \"Rich Girl\" became the duo\\'s first number one single.Although they had several minor hits between 1977 and 1980, the albums Hall &amp; Oates released at the end of the decade were not as successful as their mid-\\'70s records. Nevertheless, they were more adventurous, incorporating more rock elements into their blue-eyed soul. The combination would finally pay off in late 1980, when the duo released the self-produced Voices, the album that marked the beginning of Hall &amp; Oates\\' greatest commercial and artistic success. The first single from Voices, a cover of the Righteous Brothers\\' \"You\\'ve Lost That Lovin\\' Feeling,\" reached number 12, yet it was the second single, \"Kiss on My List\" that confirmed their commercial potential by becoming the duo\\'s second number one single; its follow-up, \"You Make My Dreams\" hit number five. They quickly released Private Eyes in the summer of 1981; the record featured two number one hits, \"Private Eyes\" and \"I Can\\'t Go for That (No Can Do),\" as well as the Top Ten hit \"Did It in a Minute.\" \"I Can\\'t Go for That (No Can Do)\" also spent a week at the top of the R&amp;B charts -- a rare accomplishment for a white act. H20 followed in 1982 and it proved more successful than their two previous albums, selling over two million copies and launching their biggest hit single, \"Maneater,\" as well as the Top Ten hits \"One on One\" and \"Family Man.\" The following year, the duo released a greatest-hits compilation, Rock \\'N Soul, Pt. 1, that featured two new Top Ten hits -- the number two \"Say It Isn\\'t So\" and \"Adult Education.\"In April of 1984, the Recording Industry Association of America announced that Hall &amp; Oates had surpassed the Everly Brothers as the most successful duo in rock history, earning a total of 19 gold and platinum awards. Released in October of 1984, Big Bam Boom expanded their number of gold and platinum awards, selling over two million copies and launching four Top 40 singles, including the number one \"Out of Touch.\" Following their contract-fulfilling gold album Live at the Apollo with David Ruffin &amp; Eddie Kendrick, Hall &amp; Oates went on hiatus. After the lukewarm reception for Daryl Hall\\'s 1986 solo album, Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine, the duo regrouped to release 1988\\'s Ooh Yeah!, their first record for Arista. The first single, \"Everything Your Heart Desires,\" went to number three and helped propel the album to platinum status.However, none of the album\\'s other singles broke the Top 20, indicating that their era of chart dominance had ended. Change of Season, released in 1990, confirmed that fact. Although the record went gold, it featured only one Top 40 hit -- the number 11 single \"So Close.\" The duo mounted a comeback in 1997 with Marigold Sky, but it was only partially successful; far better was 2003\\'s Do It for Love and the following year\\'s soul covers record Our Kind of Soul.The issuing of \"greatest-hits\" albums reached a fever pitch during the 2000s, with no fewer than 15 different collections seeing the light by 2008. Live records proliferated as well, with the A&amp;E Live by Request release Live in Concert hitting stores in 2003, a reissue of their Ecstasy on the Edge 1979 concert (titled simply In Concert this time around) in 2006, and the Live at the Troubadour two-CD/one-DVD set in 2008. As far as proper studio albums go, the 2000s were lean, with only three releases -- the aforementioned Do It for Love and Our Kind of Soul, topped off by Home for Christmas in 2006. A career-spanning box set appeared in 2009, titled Do What You Want, Be What You Are: The Music of Daryl Hall and John Oates.During the 2010s, the duo were very active, both together and separately. Several Hall &amp; Oates tours were mounted, and they performed together on American Idol and The Voice. In 2011, Hall released his fifth solo album, Laughing Down Crying, on Verve Forecast, and that same year Oates released a blues tribute album titled Mississippi Mile. Three years later, Oates drafted contemporary pop stars including Ryan Tedder and Hot Chelle Rae for Good Road to Follow. Also in 2014, the duo were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; J. Scott McClintock, Rovi'\n",

      "'Throughout the entirety of a one-of-a-kind creative journey, Kate Bush has achieved the rare feat of making innovative, fearlessly experimental work that\\'s also wildly successful. From the start, Bush\\'s music was ambitious and strange, and her mélange of art rock, pop hooks, theatrical twists, fantastical vocal performances, and complex musicianship resulted in hits. She became an immediate star in the U.K. in 1978 with the release of her debut single, \"Wuthering Heights,\" and the subsequent album The Kick Inside, when she was just 19. While the crystal-clear high notes and lush instrumentation of \"Wuthering Heights\" set the scene for her star to rise, Bush expanded her vision rapidly with the subsequent self-produced albums The Dreaming (1982) and Hounds of Love (1985), both of which saw her embracing rudimentary electronic music production along with more personal lyrical themes and an unflinching commitment to conceptual presentation that put her at high risk for commercial failure. Quite the opposite played out, however, as these visionary albums broke through worldwide. Always working at a deliberate pace, Bush took a hiatus between 1993\\'s The Red Shoes and 2005\\'s Aerial, and from there sporadically released new material like 2011\\'s 50 Words for Snow. The impact of Bush\\'s music, aesthetic, and approach to art cannot be understated. Along with the impression her sound made on peers like Peter Gabriel, Eurythmics, Erasure, Prince, and others, echoes of Bush\\'s reality-bending vocal style and imaginative sound sculpting have appeared perennially in every generation of new artists that followed her. While a direct resemblance can be heard to stars like Tori Amos, Björk, Antony and the Johnsons, or FKA Twigs, the totality of her influence is much deeper, with everyone from John Lydon to Grimes to OutKast\\'s Big Boi citing Bush as a guiding force for their music.Kate Bush was born Catherine Bush in 1958. She studied piano and violin while attending the St. Joseph\\'s Convent Grammar School in Abbey Wood in South London. By the time she was a teenager, she was writing songs of her own. A family friend brought her to the attention of Pink Floyd lead guitarist David Gilmour, who arranged for the 15-year-old to record her first demo. With Gilmour\\'s help, Bush was signed to EMI Records at age 16, though the company made the decision to break her in slowly. She studied dance, mime, and voice, and continued writing. She also began thinking in terms of which of the 200 or so songs she\\'d written would be on her first recording, and by 1977, she was ready to begin her formal career, which she did with an original song, \"Wuthering Heights,\" based on material from Emily Bronte\\'s novel (and more directly inspired by Bush\\'s seeing the 1970 film directed by Robert Fuest and starring Timothy Dalton and Anna Caulder Marshall). \"Wuthering Heights\" hit number one on the British charts when it was released in 1978, and Bush immediately arrived. Her debut album, The Kick Inside, a collection of material that she had written from the age of 15 and onward -- some of it displaying extremely provocative and sophisticated sexual references and images -- reached number three and sold over a million copies in the U.K.Bush\\'s second album, Lionheart, reached number six but didn\\'t achieve anything like the sales totals or critical acclaim of its predecessor, and in later years, Bush regretted the rush in planning and recording that album to capitalize on the success of her debut. In England during the spring of 1979, she embarked on what proved to be the only concert tour of the first 37 years of her career, playing a series of shows highlighted by 17 costume changes, lots of dancing, and complex lighting. Bush was also one of the first rock performers to use a wireless microphone, which freed her up to move around the stage as few singers before her had been capable of doing. The tour proved both exhausting and financially disastrous, and she limited her live performances for many years afterward. By the start of the \\'80s, Bush was established as one of the most challenging and eccentric artists ever to have achieved success in rock music, with a range of sounds and thematic content that constantly challenged her audiences. \"Babooshka\" (1980) became her first Top Five single since \"Wuthering Heights,\" and her subsequent album, Never for Ever, entered the British charts at number one in September of 1980. During this period, Bush began co-producing her own work, a decisive step toward refining her sound and also establishing her independence from her record company. Her 1982 album The Dreaming was her first completely self-produced LP, and included some of her most experimental and adventurous work up to that point. Bush had been inspired by seeing a Stevie Wonder concert where Wonder used a Fairlight CMI synthesizer (an early digital synth), and she experimented heavily with the Fairlight throughout The Dreaming, with its cold and futuristic sounds blending around Bush\\'s unorthodox songwriting. The Dreaming peaked at number three in the U.K. From that point forward, Bush produced all of her albums herself.In August of 1985, Bush released \"Running Up That Hill,\" which became her second biggest-selling single. The accompanying album, Hounds of Love, the first record made in her home studio, debuted on the British charts at the number one position in September of 1985 and remained there for a full month, and soon after \"Running Up That Hill\" broke through in the U.S., it reached number 30 on Billboard\\'s charts. By this time in England, Bush ranked alongside Madonna in terms of her musical impact, \"Running Up That Hill\" having bumped \"Like a Virgin\" out of the number one chart position. The changes in her sound and her development as a writer/performer were showcased in the January 1987 best-of collection The Whole Story, for which she also re-recorded the lead vocal for \"Wuthering Heights\" to bring the song more in line with her sound at the time. The album also featured her latest single, \"Experiment IV,\" whose lyrics were built on a science fiction story line that was echoed in the video, which Bush directed with a cast of familiar movie performers, and which came out like a miniaturized musical version of a Quatermass-like chiller. That same year, Bush won the Best British Female Artist award at the sixth annual BRIT Awards in London. In October of 1989, Bush\\'s sixth album, The Sensual World, reached the British number two spot and received an unprecedented promotional push in America, where she signed with Columbia Records for her future releases. Bush\\'s next album, The Red Shoes (1993), inspired by the 1948 film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, debuted in the American Top 30, the first time one of her albums had ever charted that high -- Bush made a rare personal appearance in New York that December for an autograph signing at Tower Records on the Lower East Side, and the line of admirers stretched almost six blocks and required her to extend her appearance by several hours.It would be another 12 years before Bush would resume her recording career. Rumors of a new album began circulating in the late \\'90s. During this time, Bush became a mother and quietly retreated to her countryside home in Berkshire, Reading, England. In 2005, Bush finally released her follow-up to The Red Shoes, the double-disc set Aerial. After another six-year silence, Bush released The Director\\'s Cut in 2011. It was a collection of 11 redone songs taken from 1989\\'s The Sensual World and 1993\\'s The Red Shoes. Bush claimed she was never quite satisfied with what was released, and therefore decided to rework elements in the chosen songs -- she recut all of her vocals and drums, and left virtually everything else unchanged. That said, the title of the song \"The Sensual World\" was renamed \"Flower of the Mountain,\" because she also changed the words. Bush proved somewhat prolific in 2011 when she released 50 Words for Snow on Anti- in November, an all-new concept recording containing seven long tracks. Jazz drummer Steve Gadd played throughout, with Bush\\'s son Bertie guesting on one track and Sir Elton John duetting with Bush on \"Snowed in at Wheeler Street.\" In March 2014, Bush shocked her fans by announcing she would be returning to the stage for the first time in 35 years. She revealed she would perform a series of concerts at London\\'s Hammersmith Apollo Theatre in August and September of that year. Bush initially booked 15 shows, all of which sold out after just 15 minutes of the tickets going on sale. Another seven nights were soon added, which were also immediate sellouts. Bush\\'s concerts, featuring an ambitious blend of music, dance, and drama, received enthusiastic reviews, and the show received the Editor\\'s Award at the London Theatre Awards. In late 2016, Bush released an album drawn from the London performances. Titled Before the Dawn, the live album was released by Bush\\'s own Fish People label, distributed by Rhino Records in Europe and the U.K. and by Concord Music in the United States. In November 2018, Bush released a series of box sets -- two on CD and four on vinyl -- that featured remastered versions of her entire back catalog, with the new mastering overseen by Bush and James Guthrie. The second CD set included four bonus discs that featured rare and unreleased material, including demos, 12\" mixes, alternate versions, and interpretations of other artists\\' songs. The four rarities discs were given a stand-alone release in March 2019 as a box set titled Other Sides. Around the same time, Bush published her first book, How to Be Invisible, a collection of lyrics. In 2022, she was nominated for a third time as a potential inductee to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. While she was not included in that year\\'s class, Bush experienced a surprising cultural revival that May thanks to the inclusion of \"Running Up That Hill\" on the fourth season of the series Stranger Things. The viral popularity of the track introduced her to a new generation of fans and pushed the song (and Hounds of Love) back onto multiple international charts. ~ Bruce Eder &amp; Fred Thomas, Rovi'\n",

      "'Combining the melodic jangle of post-Smiths indie guitar pop with the lilting, trance-inducing sonic textures of late-\\'80s dream pop and adding a slight Celtic tint, the Cranberries became one of the more successful groups to emerge from the pre-Brit-pop indie scene of the early \\'90s. Led by vocalist Dolores O\\'Riordan, whose keening, powerful voice was the most distinctive element of the group\\'s sound, they initially had little impact in the United Kingdom. It wasn\\'t until the lush ballad \"Linger\" became a worldwide hit in 1993 that the band achieved mass success. Following \"Linger,\" the Cranberries quickly became international stars, as both their 1993 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\\'t We?, and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of copies and produced a string of hit singles. By the time of their third album, 1996\\'s To the Faithful Departed, they had added distorted guitars to their sonic palette and began crafting more socially conscious music. They continued down this path into the 21st century before taking an extended hiatus in 2003 to pursue solo efforts. After nearly a decade, the quartet returned with 2012\\'s Roses and 2017\\'s Something Else. However, in early 2018, O\\'Riordan died from an accidental drowning in London. Her last vocal recordings were used to construct the Cranberries\\' final work, 2019\\'s Grammy-nominated In the End, a goodbye to O\\'Riordan, fans, and the band itself.Originally, the Cranberries were a band called the Cranberry Saw Us. Brothers Noel and Mike Hogan (guitar and bass, respectively) formed the band in Limerick, Ireland, with drummer Fergal Lawler in 1990. Following the departure of the group\\'s original singer, Niall Quinn, the trio placed an advertisement for a female singer. Dolores O\\'Riordan responded to the advertisement and auditioned by writing lyrics and melodies to some of the band\\'s existing demos. When she returned with a rough version of \"Linger,\" the group hired her on the spot. Shortly after she joined, the band recorded a demo tape and sold it in record stores throughout Ireland. After the original run of 300 copies sold out, the group truncated its name to the Cranberries and sent another demo tape, which featured early versions of both \"Linger\" and \"Dreams,\" to record companies throughout the U.K. The tape was made at Xeric Studios, which was run by Pearse Gilmore, who would later become their manager. At the time the tape was made, all of the members were still in their late teens.The demo tape earned the attention of both the U.K. press and record industry, and there was soon a bidding war between major British record labels. Eventually, the group signed with Island. The Cranberries headed into the studio with Gilmore as their producer to record their first single, \"Uncertain.\" The title proved to be prophetic, as the band did indeed sound ill at ease on the single, leading to poor reviews in the press in addition to tensions between the group and Gilmore. Before they were scheduled to record their debut in 1992, the Cranberries discovered that Gilmore had signed a secret deal with Island to improve his studios. The tensions within the band became so great they nearly broke up. Instead, the Cranberries severed all relations with Gilmore, hired Geoff Travis of Rough Trade as their new manager, and hired Stephen Street, who had previously worked with the Smiths, as their new producer.The band\\'s debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\\'t We?, was released in the spring of 1993, followed by a single of \"Dreams.\" Neither the album nor the single gained much attention, nor did the second single, \"Linger.\" In the summer and fall of 1993, the band toured the United States, opening for The The and Suede, respectively; frequently, the Cranberries were given a friendlier reception than either of the headliners. Their strong live shows led MTV to put \"Linger\" into heavy rotation. By the end of the year, the single was on its way to becoming a crossover hit. Eventually, the single reached number eight on the U.S. charts, while the album went double platinum. Everybody Else and \"Linger\" began to take off in Britain in early 1994; the album eventually peaked at number one during the summer.O\\'Riordan married the band\\'s tour manager, Don Burton, in a much-publicized ceremony in July 1994. The marriage, as well as the group\\'s videos, emphasized the singer as the focal point of the band. O\\'Riordan\\'s position in the group continued to rise with the fall release of the group\\'s second album, No Need to Argue. Boasting a slightly harder, more streamlined sound, yet still produced by Stephen Street, the record debuted at number six on the U.S. charts and eventually outsold its predecessor; within a year it went triple platinum, spawning the number one modern rock hit \"Zombie\" and the number 11 \"Ode to My Family.\"During the tour for No Need to Argue, rumors began to circulate that O\\'Riordan was going to leave the band to pursue a solo career, all of which the band vehemently denied. Nevertheless, the rumors persisted until the Cranberries began recording their next album with producer Bruce Fairbairn, who had previously worked with Aerosmith. The resulting effort, To the Faithful Departed, was a tougher, more rock-oriented affair. Upon its spring 1996 release, it entered the charts at number six, but its first single, \"Salvation,\" failed to become a hit on par with \"Zombie,\" \"Linger,\" or \"Ode to My Family.\" Consequently, the album slipped down the charts relatively quickly and only went platinum, which was slightly disappointing in light of its two predecessors\\' multi-platinum status. During the fall of 1996, the group canceled its Australian and European tours, sparking another round of rumors about O\\'Riordan launching a solo career. In 1999, the group released Bury the Hatchet, their last big chart hit, and quickly followed with 2001\\'s Wake Up and Smell the Coffee. Shortly after the release of a greatest-hits compilation in 2003, Stars: The Best of 1992-2002, the Cranberries officially declared that they were taking a break. This finally gave O\\'Riordan the time she needed to work on her long-talked-about solo album, Are You Listening?, which hit shelves in 2007. In 2009, O\\'Riordan released her second solo album, No Baggage. Around the same time, the Cranberries reunited for a North American tour that continued throughout Europe in 2010. Several live albums also appeared in 2010. In 2011, the band began work on a new album in Toronto with longtime producer Street. Released nearly a decade after the start of their extended hiatus, the resulting album, Roses, arrived in March 2012. A supporting tour followed, recorded for posterity at London\\'s Hammersmith Apollo on Live 2012. At the end of 2013, O\\'Riordan performed a New Year\\'s Eve concert in Limerick with a string quartet from the Irish Chamber Orchestra. Inspired by the classical interpretation of the Cranberries sound, she approached the band with an idea to celebrate their silver anniversary. The result was a full album comprising string quartet renditions of the band\\'s biggest hits. Something Else arrived in the spring of 2017, featuring their ten most successful singles culled from their first four albums, as well as three new songs. The band kicked off a tour in support of the album, but it was cut short due to O\\'Riordan\\'s ongoing back problems.On January 15, 2018, O\\'Riordan died of an accidental drowning at the age of 46 in London. At the time of her death, the Cranberries were in the middle of recording a new effort. After taking some time to process the tragedy, the remaining bandmembers decided to finish the project. Along with Stephen Street, they completed the LP using O\\'Riordan\\'s demo vocals. Released in April 2019, In the End featured the single \"All Over Now\" and served as the Cranberries\\' final album. Peaking in the Top 10 across Europe and in the U.S. side charts, the farewell set was later nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Album. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'INXS hailed from the pubs of Australia, which is part of the reason the band never comfortably fit in with new wave. Even when they branched out into synth pop on their early recordings, they were underpinned by a hard, Stonesy beat and the Jagger-esque strut of lead singer Michael Hutchence. Ultimately, these were the very things that made INXS into international superstars in the late \\'80s. By that time, the group had harnessed its hard rock, dance, and new wave influences into a sleek, stylish groove that made their 1987 album Kick a multi-million-selling hit. While that sound was their key to stardom, it also proved to be their undoing; INXS became boxed in by their style of Stonesy pop-funk in the early \\'90s, when audiences became entranced by harder-edged alternative rock. The band continued to tour and record for a dedicated fan base until Hutchence\\'s untimely death in 1997 brought the band\\'s heyday to a close.Appropriately for a band that featured three brothers, INXS had their roots in a family act, the Farriss Brothers. The group came together while keyboardist Andrew Farriss, the middle brother, was attending high school with vocalist Michael Hutchence. The two formed a band with bassist Gary Beers. Simultaneously, guitarist Tim Farriss was playing in various groups with his friend, guitarist/saxophonist Kirk Pengilly. Eventually, the two groups merged in 1977, with Jon Farriss joining the unified lineup as drummer. Two years later, when Jon graduated from high school, the band renamed itself INXS, moved from Perth to Sydney, and began to play the pub circuit. Within a year, the group landed an Australian record contract and released an eponymous debut on Deluxe in 1980. INXS and Underneath the Colours (1981) became Australian hits, leading the band to an American contract with Atco Records. In 1983, they released their U.S. debut, Shabooh Shoobah, and embarked on an extensive tour which, thanks to the hit single \"Don\\'t Change,\" made them minor new wave stars. For their next album, INXS recorded a few sessions with producer Nile Rodgers, which resulted in the sleek, funky \"Original Sin,\" the first inclination that the band was making a move toward a fusion of Stonesy rock and dance music. \"Original Sin\" made 1984\\'s The Swing a minor hit, yet the group didn\\'t have a genuine mainstream breakthrough until 1985\\'s Listen Like Thieves, which climbed to number 11 in the U.S. on the strength of the single \"What You Need.\"Listen Like Thieves laid the groundwork for Kick, the album that made INXS international superstars. Released late in 1987, Kick worked its way to multi-platinum status over the course of 1988, as four singles -- the number one \"Need You Tonight,\" \"Devil Inside,\" \"New Sensation,\" and \"Never Tear Us Apart\" -- climbed into the U.S. Top Ten. In the wake of the album\\'s success, Hutchence was hailed in some quarters as the heir to Jagger\\'s throne, and the group was considered to rival U2 in terms of international popularity. However, such success went to the group\\'s head. Hutchence released the \"experimental\" side project Max Q in early 1990, and the record tanked. X, INXS\\' follow-up to Kick, appeared in the fall of 1990 to mostly negative reviews. While the album generated several hits, including \"Disappear\" and \"Bitter Tears,\" only its first single, \"Suicide Blonde,\" reached the Top Ten in the U.S., and the sales of X were disappointing when compared to Kick.X hurt INXS\\' momentum considerably. Although the group was still quite popular on its accompanying tour -- the 1991 live album Live Baby Live was recorded at Wembley Stadium, the second largest stadium in Europe -- the group could no longer be considered in the same league as U2 or R.E.M. Hutchence continued to live a jet-setting lifestyle, dating Kylie Minogue and various supermodels, which did not wear well in the wake of alternative rock\\'s commercial breakthrough in 1992. By the time INXS released Welcome to Wherever You Are, their most adventurous record, they were out of date in 1992, and even a rash of reviews that favorably compared the record to U2\\'s Achtung Baby couldn\\'t make it a hit. Full Moon, Dirty Hearts followed in 1993 and was generally ignored. Following its release, INXS left Atlantic\\'s roster, releasing Greatest Hits as their last album for the label.INXS signed with PolyGram in 1994, yet it took them three years to release a new album. During that time, Hutchence was involved in several tabloid scandals, most notably his love affair with British TV personality Paula Yates (which brought an end to her marriage to Bob Geldof), and he hinted that he was recording a solo album. That record didn\\'t materialize, but INXS returned in the spring of 1997 with Elegantly Wasted. While the album was greeted with poor reviews, its hedonistic dance-rock was better suited to the late \\'90s than the early \\'90s, which made the record the group\\'s biggest hit since X. On November 22 of that year, however, Hutchence was found dead in his Sydney hotel room, the victim of an apparent hanging. His long-in-the-works solo debut was posthumously issued in late 1999. Terence Trent D\\'Arby took the frontman role for an abbreviated set at the opening of Sydney\\'s Stadium Australia in 1999, and Jon Stevens filled the spot for occasional gigs that took place through the end of 2003. The latter singer eventually left to pursue a solo career. INXS remained quiet throughout the following year, but in 2005 they teamed up with reality show maverick Mark Burnett to launch Rock Star: INXS, a global TV show that aimed to find a permanent replacement for Hutchence. The winner was J.D. Fortune, a former Elvis impersonator from Canada. Fortune joined INXS, sang on their 2005 album Switch, and participated in the accompanying world tour. Switch only charted well in Fortune\\'s native Canada, though, and his cocaine habit drove a wedge between Fortune and his bandmates as the tour wound down. Another period of inactivity followed. When INXS returned in 2010, they did so with a long list of guest vocalists, retaining Fortune as the official frontman but enlisting stars like Rob Thomas and Ben Harper to appear on their next album, Original Sin, which featured reworked versions of the band\\'s past hits. Released in November of 2010, it charted just outside the Top 40 in Australia. The band played often during the subsequent two years, but at the end of 2012 announced that they weren\\'t going to tour anymore. A miniseries fictionalizing the band\\'s history called INXS: Never Tear Us Apart aired on Australian TV in 2014. Five years later, a documentary about Michael Hutchence called Mystify: A Musical Journey with Michael Hutchence was released, accompanied by a soundtrack. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Following the disbandment of Eurythmics in 1991, vocalist Annie Lennox began a solo career that rivaled Eurythmics\\' in terms of crossover popularity. Born and raised in Aberdeen, Scotland, Lennox began playing music as child, learning how to play both the piano and flute. In her late teens, she won a scholarship to London\\'s Royal Academy of Music, but she dropped out before she took her finals. For the next several years, she worked around London, performing various jobs during the day and singing at night. In the late \\'70s, she met guitarist Dave Stewart through a friend. Stewart, who had previously played with Longdancer, asked Lennox to join a new band he was forming with a songwriter named Peet Coombes. The band was named the Tourists, and they released three albums between 1979 and 1980 and scored a number four U.K. hit with a cover of Dusty Springfield\\'s \"I Only Want to Be with You.\"While they were collaborating in the Tourists, Lennox and Stewart became lovers. Soon, tensions within the band grew, and by 1980 the pair had left the band to begin Eurythmics. During the early \\'80s, the sleek synth pop of Eurythmics became one of the most popular sounds of new wave, racking up a number of hits in both the U.S. and U.K., including \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),\" \"Love Is a Stranger,\" \"Who\\'s That Girl,\" and \"Here Comes the Rain Again.\" Midway through their career, Eurythmics began pursuing a harder, more straightforward rock &amp; roll sound.In 1990, following the release of Eurythmics\\' commercial disappointment We Too Are One, Lennox announced that she was taking a two-year sabbatical to have a child. During this time, the group quietly dissolved, Lennox had a baby, and she began working on her first solo album. Diva, her solo debut, arrived in 1992 and showcased a calmer, more mature vocalist designed to cross over into the adult contemporary market. On the strength of the singles \"Walking on Broken Glass\" (number 14) and \"Why\" (number 34), Diva sold over two million copies in the U.S. alone; the album was also nominated for three Grammy awards.Lennox delivered her second solo album, a covers collection entitled Medusa, in 1995. Peaking at number 11, Medusa spawned the hit single \"No More I Love You\\'s\" and went platinum by the end of 1995. Lennox took some time off to raise her child and become more actively involved with humanitarian endeavors. A full eight years after Medusa was released, she returned with Bare, one of the strongest and most personal albums of her career. After another break, she released Songs of Mass Destruction in September 2007 and made plans to embark on an extensive North American tour, starting in October. Three years later, Lennox returned to recording with her first holiday album, entitled A Christmas Cornucopia. In 2014, she delivered another covers-oriented album, the Mike Stevens-produced Nostalgia. The following year, Lennox re-released the album as Nostalgia: An Evening with Annie Lennox, which included both the original studio album and a bonus Blu-Ray disc of her live PBS concert recorded on-stage at Los Angeles\\' historic Orpheum Theatre backed by a 19-piece ensemble. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Chicago was one of the most successful bands of the rock era, racking up 21 Billboard Top Ten hits between 1970 and 1990, a period where they survived the departure of key band members while also subtly adapting to changing times. That\\'s not an easy task for any rock band and it\\'s especially difficult for a group like Chicago, a band that placed equal (if not greater) emphasis on horns as guitar. Picking up where Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears left off, Chicago initially specialized in jazz-inflected prog-rock, using the sides of a vinyl record as canvasses for sprawling, adventurous rock. Chicago quickly learned how to channel this expansive sound into concise pop songs, scoring hits in the early 1970s with such punchy tunes as \"25 or 6 to 4\" and \"Beginnings,\" while also showing facility with sweeter melodies on \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\" and \"Saturday in the Park.\" As the decade progressed, the band began to emphasize their softer side with bassist Peter Cetera singing such mellow standards as \"If You Leave Me Now,\" \"Baby, What a Big Surprise\" and \"Hard to Say I\\'m Sorry.\" The band stayed in this lane after Cetera\\'s departure in the mid-1980s, not missing a beat with new lead vocalist BIll Champlin; he sang the number one hit \"Look Away,\" as well as \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Without Your Love\" and \"Look Away.\" Hits dried up in the 1990s but Chicago remained a pop/rock institution, with original members keyboardist Robert Lamm, trumpeter Lee Loughnane and trombonist James Pankow leading a rotating cast of supporting members through regular tours and albums. Chicago marked the confluence of two distinct, but intermingling, musical strains in Chicago, Illinois, in the mid-\\'60s: an academic approach and one coming from the streets. Reed player Walter Parazaider (born March 14, 1945, in Chicago), trumpeter Lee Loughnane (born October 21, 1946, in Chicago), and trombonist James Pankow (born August 20, 1947, in St. Louis, Missouri) were all music students at DePaul University. But they moonlighted in the city\\'s clubs, playing everything from R&amp;B to Irish music, and there they encountered less formally educated but no less talented players like guitarist Terry Kath (born January 31, 1946, in Chicago; died January 23, 1978, in Los Angeles, California) and drummer Danny Seraphine (born August 28, 1948, in Chicago). In the mid-\\'60s, most rock groups followed the instrumentation of the Beatles -- two guitars, bass, and drums -- and horn sections were heard only in R&amp;B. But in the summer of 1966, the Beatles used horns on \"Got to Get You into My Life\" and, as usual, pop music began to follow their lead. At the end of the year, the Buckinghams, a Chicago band guided by a friend of Parazaider\\'s, James William Guercio, scored a national hit with the horn-filled \"Kind of a Drag,\" which went on to hit number one in February 1967. That was all the encouragement Parazaider and his friends needed. Parazaider called a meeting of the band-to-be at his apartment on February 15, 1967, inviting along a talented organist and singer he had run across, Robert Lamm (born October 13, 1944, in Brooklyn, New York). Lamm agreed to join and also said he could supply the missing bass sounds to the ensemble using the organ\\'s foot pedals (a skill he had not actually acquired at the time). Developing a repertoire of James Brown and Wilson Pickett material, the new band rehearsed in Parazaider\\'s parents\\' basement before beginning to get gigs around town under the name the Big Thing. Soon, they were playing around the Midwest. By this time, Guercio had become a staff producer at Columbia Records, and he encouraged the band to begin developing original songs. Kath, and especially Lamm, took up the suggestion. (Soon, Pankow also became a major writer for the band.) Meanwhile, the sextet became a septet when Peter Cetera (born September 13, 1944, in Chicago), singer and bassist for a rival Midwest band, the Exceptions, agreed to defect and join the Big Thing. This gave the group the unusual versatility of having three lead singers, the smooth baritone Lamm, the gruff baritone Kath, and Cetera, who was an elastic tenor. When Guercio came back to see the group in the late winter of 1968, he deemed them ready for the next step. In June 1968, he financed their move to Los Angeles. Guercio exerted a powerful influence on the band as its manager and producer, which would become a problem over time. At first, the bandmembers were willing to live together in a two-bedroom house, practice all the time, and change the group\\'s name to one of Guercio\\'s choosing, Chicago Transit Authority. Guercio\\'s growing power at Columbia Records enabled him to get the band signed there and to set in place the unusual image the band would have. He convinced the label to let this neophyte band release a double album as its debut (that is, when they agreed to a cut in their royalties), and he decided the group would be represented on the cover by a logo instead of a photograph. Chicago Transit Authority, released in April 1969, debuted on the charts in May as the band began touring nationally. By July, the album had reached the Top 20, without benefit of a hit single. It had been taken up by the free-form FM rock stations and become an underground hit. It was certified gold by the end of the year and eventually went on to sell more than two million copies. (In September 1969, the band played the Toronto Rock \\'n\\' Roll Festival, and somehow the promoter obtained the right to tape the show. That same lo-fi tape has turned up in an endless series of albums ever since, including Anthology, Beat the Bootleggers: Live 1967, Beginnings, Beginnings Live, Chicago [Classic World], and Chicago Live.To Guercio\\'s surprise, he was contacted by the real Chicago Transit Authority, which objected to the band\\'s use of the name; he responded by shortening the name to simply \"Chicago.\" When he and the group finished the second album (another double) for release at the start of 1970, it was called Chicago, though it has since become known as Chicago II. Chicago II vaulted into the Top Ten in its second week on the Billboard chart, even before its first single, \"Make Me Smile,\" hit the Hot 100. The single was an excerpt from a musical suite, and the band at first objected to the editing considered necessary to prepare it for AM radio play. But it went on to reach the Top Ten, as did its successor, \"25 or 6 to 4.\" The album quickly went gold and eventually platinum. In the fall of 1970, Columbia released \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?,\" drawn from the group\\'s first album, as its next single; it gave them their third consecutive Top Ten hit. Chicago III, another double album, was ready for release at the start of 1971, and it just missed hitting number one while giving the band a third gold (and later platinum) LP. Its singles did not reach the Top Ten, however, and Columbia again reached back, releasing \"Beginnings\" (from the first album) backed with \"Colour My World\" (from the second) to give Chicago its fourth Top Ten single. Next up was a live album, the four-disc box set Chicago at Carnegie Hall, which, despite its size, crested in the Top Five and sold over a million copies. (The band itself preferred Live in Japan, an album recorded in February 1972 and initially released only in Japan.) Chicago V, a one-LP set, released in July 1972, spent nine weeks at number one on its way to selling over two million copies, spurred by its gold-selling Top Ten hit \"Saturday in the Park.\" Chicago VI followed a year later and repeated the same success, launching the Top Ten singles \"Feelin\\' Stronger Every Day\" and \"Just You \\'n\\' Me.\" The next Top Ten hit, \"(I\\'ve Been) Searchin\\' So Long,\" was released in advance of Chicago VII in the late winter of 1974. The album was the band\\'s third consecutive chart-topper and another million-seller. \"Call on Me\" became its second Top Ten single. Chicago VIII, which marked the promotion of sideman percussionist Laudir de Oliveira as a full-fledged bandmember, appeared in the spring of 1975, spawned the Top Ten hit \"Old Days,\" and became the band\\'s fourth consecutive number one LP. After the profit-taking Chicago IX: Chicago\\'s Greatest Hits in the fall of 1975 came Chicago X, which missed hitting number one but eventually sold over two million copies, in part because of the inclusion of the Grammy-winning number one single \"If You Leave Me Now.\" Chicago XI, released in the late summer of 1977, continued the seemingly endless string of success, reaching the Top Ten, selling a million copies, and generating the Top Five hit \"Baby, What a Big Surprise.\" But there was trouble beneath the surface. The band\\'s big hits were starting to be solely ballads sung by Cetera, which frustrated the musicians\\' musical ambitions. They had failed to attract critical notice, and what press attention they were given often alluded to Guercio\\'s Svengali-like control as manager and producer. Chicago determined to fire Guercio and demonstrate that they could succeed without him. Shortly afterward, they were struck by a crushing blow. Kath, a gun enthusiast, accidentally shot and killed himself on January 23, 1978. Though he, like most of the other members of the band, was not readily recognizable outside the group, he had actually had a large say in its direction, and his loss was incalculable. Nevertheless, the band closed ranks and went on. Guitarist Donnie Dacus was chosen from auditions and joined the band in time for its 12th LP release, which was given a non-numerical title, Hot Streets, and which put prominent pictures of the bandmembers on the cover for the first time. The sound, as indicated by the first single, the Top 20 hit \"Alive Again,\" was harder rock, and the band\\'s core following responded, but Hot Streets was Chicago\\'s first album since 1969 to miss the Top Ten. Chicago 13 then missed the Top 20. (At this point, Dacus left the band, and Chicago hired guitarist Chris Pinnick as a sideman, eventually upping him to full-fledged group-member status.) Released in 1980, Chicago XIV, the last album to feature de Oliveira, didn\\'t go gold. By 1981, with the release of the 15th album, the poor-selling Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, the band parted ways with Columbia Records and began looking for a new approach. They found it in writer/producer David Foster, who returned to an emphasis on the band\\'s talent for power ballads as sung by Cetera. They also brought in one of Foster\\'s favorite session musicians, Bill Champlin (born May 21, 1947, in Oakland, California), as a full-fledged bandmember. Champlin, formerly the leader of the Sons of Champlin, was a multi-instrumentalist with a gruff voice that allowed him to sing the parts previously taken by Kath. With these additions, the band signed with Full Moon Records, an imprint of Warner Bros., and released Chicago 16 in the spring of 1982, prefaced by the single \"Hard to Say I\\'m Sorry,\" which topped the charts, leading to a major comeback. The album returned Chicago to million-selling Top Ten status. Chicago 17, released in the spring of 1984, was even more successful -- in fact, the biggest-selling album of the band\\'s career -- with platinum certifications for six million copies as of 1997. It spawned two Top Five hits, \"Hard Habit to Break\" and \"You\\'re the Inspiration.\" The renewed success, however, changed the long-established group dynamics, thrusting Cetera out as a star. He left the band for a solo career in 1985. (Pinnick also left at about this time, and the band did not immediately bring in a new guitarist.) As Cetera\\'s replacement, Chicago found Jason Scheff, the 23-year-old bass-playing son of famed bassist Jerry Scheff, a longtime sideman with Elvis Presley. Scheff boasted a tenor voice that allowed him to re-create Cetera\\'s singing on many Chicago hits. The split with Cetera had a negative commercial impact, however. Despite boasting a Top Five hit single in \"Will You Still Love Me?,\" 1986\\'s Chicago 18 only went gold. The band recovered, however, with Chicago 19, released in the spring of 1988. Among its singles, \"I Don\\'t Want to Live Without Your Love\" made the Top Five, \"Look Away\" topped the charts, and \"You\\'re Not Alone\" made the Top Ten as the album went platinum. Another single, \"What Kind of Man Would I Be?,\" originally found on the album, was included as part of the 1989 compilation Greatest Hits 1982-1989 (which counted as the 20th album) and became a Top Five hit, while the album sold five million copies by 1997. At the turn of the \\'80s into the \\'90s, Chicago underwent two more personnel changes, with guitarist DaWayne Bailey joining and original drummer Danny Seraphine departing, to be replaced by Tris Imboden. Chicago Twenty 1, released at the start of 1991, sold disappointingly, and Warner rejected the band\\'s next offering (though tracks from it did turn up on compilations). Chicago, however, maintained a loyal following that enabled them to tour successfully every summer. In 1995, Keith Howland replaced Bailey as Chicago\\'s guitarist. The same year, the band regained rights to its Columbia catalog and established its own Chicago Records label to reissue the albums. They also signed to Giant Records, another Warner imprint, to release their 22nd album, Night &amp; Day, a collection of big-band standards that made the Top 100.In 1998, they released Chicago 25: The Christmas Album on Chicago Records, and they followed it in 1999 with Chicago XXVI: The Live Album. And the success of The Very Best of Chicago: Only the Beginning demonstrated that their music continued to appeal to fans. Feeding off the renewed interest, the band reappeared in 2006 with the new album Chicago XXX on Rhino. Two years later, the rejected Warner album from 1993 was finally released by Rhino as Stone of Sisyphus: XXXII. Chicago toured regularly during the final years of the 2000s and returned to the recording studio with producer Phil Ramone for the 2011 album O Christmas Three (aka Chicago XXXIII). During the early 2010s, they performed often, and went on several joint tours with the Doobie Brothers. In May 2013, the band announced they\\'d begun recording their next album, and released several songs sporadically throughout the rest of the year. They also made a splash at the 2014 Grammy Awards, performing several of their classics with Robin Thicke. The album, aptly titled Chicago XXXVI: Now, was their first collection of original material in eight years when it appeared in July 2014. Chicago were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2016; Peter Cetera declined to attend the ceremony. Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago, a two-hour documentary about the band\\'s career, debuted on CNN in 2017. The group\\'s fourth album of holiday-themed music, Chicago Christmas, arrived in 2019. Chicago received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020, an honor that was followed by a few lineup changes. Lamm, Loughnane, and Pankow led this new incarnation of Chicago through Born for This Moment, their 38th album, which was released in July 2022. ~ William Ruhlmann, Rovi'\n",

      "'Stone Temple Pilots embark upon a new sonic adventure with Perdida, the band\\'s first-ever acoustic album. It includes 10 deeply personal songs that weave introspective lyrics together with unexpected instruments to take listeners on an emotional and musical journey through letting go and starting over. Bassist Robert DeLeo says Perdida (Spanish for ‘loss\\') shows how music has helped them process grief, search for meaning and, ultimately, create something beautiful from the pain. “When I\\'ve gone through things in my life, I\\'ve found that sitting down and having an honest conversation with my guitar is the best therapy.”“Recording an acoustic album like Perdida is something the band has wanted to do for many years,” says drummer Eric Kretz. “When Robert and Dean started playing their new songs for us during our tour last year, we knew right away they would be perfect for an acoustic album.” Writing lyrics for Perdida meant exposing himself like never before, says singer Jeff Gutt, who joined the band in 2017. “It\\'s an emotionally honest album and I needed to approach it that way for these songs to resonate.\"To record Perdida, the quartet assembled at Kretz\\'s Bomb Shelter Studios in February. The key to making the album, Dean explains, was finding a way to say more with less. “Everything you hear serves a purpose, from the space in the arrangements to the different instruments. We only added things that served the songs.”'\n",

      "'From the groundbreaking orchestrated productions of the Drifters to his own solo hits, Ben E. King was the definition of R&amp;B elegance. King\\'s plaintive baritone had all the passion of gospel, but the settings in which it was displayed were tailored more for his honey smooth phrasing and crisp enunciation, proving for perhaps the first time that R&amp;B could be sophisticated and accessible to straight pop audiences. King\\'s approach influenced countless smooth soul singers in his wake, and his records were key forerunners of the Motown sound.King was born Benjamin Earl Nelson in Henderson, North Carolina, in 1938, and sang with his church choir before the family moved to Harlem in 1947. In junior high, he began performing with a street corner doo wop group called the Four B\\'s, which won second place in an Apollo Theater talent contest. While still in high school, he was offered a chance to join the Moonglows, but was simply too young and inexperienced to stick. He subsequently worked at his father\\'s restaurant as a singing waiter, which led to an invitation to become the baritone singer in a doo wop outfit called the Five Crowns in 1958. The Five Crowns performed several gigs at the Apollo Theater along with the Drifters, whose career had begun to flounder in the years since original lead singer Clyde McPhatter departed. Drifters manager George Treadwell, dissatisfied with the group members\\' unreliability and lack of success, fired them all in the summer of 1958 and hired the Five Crowns to assume the name of the Drifters (which he owned). The new Drifters toured for about a year, playing to often hostile audiences who knew they were a completely different group. In early 1959, they went into the studio with producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller to cut their first records. A song Nelson (still performing under his given name) co-wrote called \"There Goes My Baby\" became his first lead vocal, and the lush backing arrangement made highly unorthodox (in fact, virtually unheard of) use of a string section. \"There Goes My Baby\" became a massive hit, laying the groundwork for virtually every smooth/uptown soul production that followed. Over the next two years, Nelson sang lead on several other Drifters classics, including \"Dance with Me,\" \"This Magic Moment,\" \"Save the Last Dance for Me,\" and \"I Count the Tears.\"In 1960, Nelson approached Treadwell about a salary increase and a fairer share of the group\\'s royalties. Treadwell rebuffed him and Nelson quit the group, at this point assuming the more memorable stage name Ben E. King in preparation for a solo career. Remaining on Atlantic, King scored his first solo hit with the stylish, Latin-tinged ballad \"Spanish Harlem,\" a Jerry Leiber/Phil Spector composition that hit the Top Ten in early 1961. The follow-up, \"Stand by Me,\" a heartfelt ode to friendship and devotion co-written by King, became his signature song and an enduring R&amp;B classic; it was also his biggest hit, topping the R&amp;B charts and reaching the pop Top Five. King scored a few more chart singles through 1963, including velvety smooth pop-soul productions like \"Amor,\" \"Don\\'t Play That Song (You Lied),\" and the Italian tune \"I (Who Have Nothing).\" In the post-British Invasion years, King had a rough go of it on the pop charts but continued to score R&amp;B hits. 1967\\'s Southern-fried \"What Is Soul?\" was one of his last singles for Atco; seeking to revive his commercial fortunes, King departed in 1969.A 1970 album on Maxwell, Rough Edges, failed to generate much attention, and King was forced to make a living touring the oldies circuit. In 1975, Atlantic president Ahmet Ertegun caught King\\'s act in a Miami lounge and invited him to re-sign with the label. King scored an unlikely comeback smash with the disco track \"Supernatural Thing, Pt. I,\" which returned him to the top of the R&amp;B charts in 1975 and also reached the pop Top Five. While he was unable to duplicate that single\\'s success, King recorded several more albums for Atlantic up through 1981, and also collaborated with the Average White Band in 1977 on the album Benny &amp; Us. After leaving Atlantic a second time, King toured in a version of the Drifters beginning in 1982.In 1986, \"Stand by Me\" was prominently featured in the Rob Reiner film of the same name; re-released as a single, it climbed into the Top Ten all over again. In its wake, King returned to solo recording, issuing albums every few years. He also guested on recordings by Heaven 17 and Mark Knopfler, among others. King\\'s 1999 album Shades of Blue (on Half Note Records) found him branching out into jazz territory, performing with a big band and guests like Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. The year 2006 saw the release of a smooth R&amp;B album, I\\'ve Been Around, on True Life Records. A 2010 date titled Heart &amp; Soul featured King with a small jazz group, stretching out on vocal standards. He continued to tour and make special performances, and was also active in the Stand by Me Foundation, his charity dedicated to children\\'s education. Ben E. King died on April 30, 2015, after a brief illness. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Jason Mraz is living full spiral. It's not full circle, exactly, because he's changed and his experiences have changed, but on his 8th studio album, Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride, the musician has found himself returning to a familiar junction in space. Throughout the album, there are hints of Mraz's formative releases, including his 2002 debut Waiting for My Rocket to Come and 2005's Mr. A-Z, but it ultimately finds a kinship with 2008's We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things. The new songs, which are unabashedly pop, see Mraz reuniting with numerous collaborators, including L.A. band Raining Jane and producer Martin Terefe, who helmed the 2008 breakout album. The songs grapple with the emotions and experiences that come with being in your mid-life, a time that is often ignored by pop songwriters. Its optimistic, inspiring sensibility reflects the musician's overall approach to being in the world. It is, in fact, full spiral, reflecting the past but becoming something new.\"\n",

      "\"Four decades into their storied career, alt-rock legends Goo Goo Dolls are still discovering new and invigorating ways to make the most exciting music they've ever recorded. With more accolades than can fit an industrial size trophy case and global No.1s celebrated across the globe, it'd make sense for a band of such proportions to phone things in, take a step back, or merely retreat from the spotlight. Almost paradoxically, though, Goo Goo Dolls have remained at the top of their game and increasingly daring over the years precisely because the music has always been put on a pedestal that remains untainted by all of the outside laurels the band has earned. On their new album, Chaos in Bloom, Goo Goo Dolls sound like a band more confident than ever in their sound, yet constantly looking for fresh ways to get their story across. Marking their first record ever to be produced by lead singer John Rzeznik, it's an album of biting sarcasm, stadium-ready choruses, and spear-sharp songwriting. In short, it's a quintessential Goo Goo Dolls album.\"\n",

      "'Over four-plus decades, Canadian power trio Rush (bassist/keyboardist/vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart) became one of rock\\'s most celebrated and enduring bands. Rush garnered a large and devoted following among hard rock, heavy metal, and prog audiences almost from the beginning. They sold over 40 million records and were nominated for seven Grammys between 1981-2010; they also netted 25 gold and/or platinum albums, and all but three entered the upper half of the Top 200. After 1981\\'s chart-topping Moving Pictures, they began a seven-year period where their recorded sound was dominated by Lee\\'s synth playing, which culminated on 1989\\'s Presto. During the \\'90s, they shifted toward a hooky and radio-friendly brand of hard rock, best exemplified by 1996\\'s Test for Echo. During their final period, they delivered studio offerings that fused heavy and prog in new ways; the last was 2012\\'s conceptual Clockwork Angels. Rush amicably split in 2015 after Peart decided to retire from touring. He died from brain cancer in early 2020.Rush formed in Toronto, Ontario in the autumn of 1968, initially comprising guitarist Alex Lifeson (born Alexander Zivojinovich), vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee (born Gary Lee Weinrib), and drummer John Rutsey. In their primary incarnation, Rush drew a heavy influence from Cream, and honed their skills on the Toronto club circuit before issuing their debut single, a rendition of Buddy Holly\\'s \"Not Fade Away,\" in 1973. A self-titled LP followed in 1974, at which time Rutsey exited; he was replaced by drummer Neil Peart, who also assumed the role of the band\\'s primary lyricist; his words gradually became a hallmark of the group\\'s recording aesthetic.With Peart firmly ensconced, Rush returned in 1975 with a pair of LPs, Fly by Night and Caress of Steel. The former bore the radio hit \"Fly by Night\" and their first metal suite in \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog.\" The album also contained \"Anthem,\" whose title and subject matter reflected the inspiration of the dystopian novella of the same title by Russian-American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand; she would become an even greater inspiration to Peart on 2112 in 1976. 2112 proved their breakthrough release: a futuristic concept album based on the writings of Rand, it fused the elements of the trio\\'s sound -- Lee\\'s high-pitched vocals, Peart\\'s epic drumming, and Lifeson\\'s complex guitar work -- into a unified whole. Fans loved it -- 2112 was the first in a long line of gold and platinum releases. It established a modus operandi the band rarely deviated from for the duratorion of its career.A Farewell to Kings followed in 1977 and reached the Top 40 in both the U.S. and Britain. After 1978\\'s Hemispheres, Rush achieved even greater popularity with 1980\\'s Permanent Waves, a record marked by the group\\'s dramatic shift into shorter, less-sprawling compositions; the single \"The Spirit of Radio\" even became a major hit at radio. With 1981\\'s Moving Pictures, they scored with \"Tom Sawyer,\" and \"Red Barchetta.\" The former garnered heavy exposure on album-oriented radio and became what is probably the trio\\'s best-known song. As the \\'80s continued, Rush grew into a phenomenally popular live draw, as albums like 1982\\'s Signals (which generated the smash \"New World Man\"), 1984\\'s Grace Under Pressure, and 1985\\'s Power Windows continued to sell millions of copies. As the decade drew to a close, the trio cut back on their touring schedule. In the studio, they were exploring more textural, synth-driven efforts exemplified by 1987\\'s Hold Your Fire (that featured Aimee Mann duetting with Lee on the charting title track single). At the dawn of the \\'90s, however, Rush returned to the heavier sound of their early records and placed a renewed emphasis on Lifeson\\'s guitar sound--1991\\'s Roll the Bones and 1993\\'s Counterparts reached the Top Three on the U.S. album charts. In 1994, Rush were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. In 1996, the band issued Test for Echo and headed for the road the following summer. In 1997, Peart lost his daughter in an automobile accident. The following year Peart\\'s wife succumbed to cancer and he took a three year break from music. In early 2001, he rejoined his bandmates, but it would be years before Vapor Trails was released. A concert from the supporting tour was released to video as Rush in Rio. In 2004, Rush embarked on their 30th anniversary tour, documented on the DVD R30, and in 2006 they returned to the studio to begin work on a new album that resulted in the 2007\\'s acclaimed Snakes &amp; Arrows. A band associated documentary called Beyond the Lighted Stage appeared in 2010. Rush\\'s 19th full-length studio concept album, Clockwork Angels, arrived in June 2012. While the following year wouldn\\'t bring a new album, it did deliver the next best thing by way of Vapor Trails: Remixed. Along with it, Rush also released Clockwork Angels Tour, a three-disc live album recorded during their 2012 tour. The band took the next year off, and in 2013 were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame. They returned in 2014 with the R40 video box set, which was released to coincide with the 40th anniversary of Neil Peart\\'s membership. The following year saw Rush embark on their North American R40 tour, which was purported to be their last large-scale tour. It was chronicled in the 2015 CD/DVD concert album R40 Live. Rush continued celebrating that anniversary for the next several years. They also undertook a reissue project that saw the release of deluxe remastered versions of catalog titles 2112, Caress of Steel, A Farewell to Kings, and Hemispheres. The latter proved bittersweet: In January of 2018, Lifeson told Toronto\\'s Globe &amp; Mail, \"We have no plans to tour or record any more. We\\'re basically done. After 41 years, we felt it was enough.\" Adding to the finality of Lifeson\\'s statement, Neil Peart died on January 7, 2020, succumbing to a three-and-a-half-year battle with brain cancer. He was 67. ~ Jason Ankeny, Rovi'\n",

      "'At the start of their career, Talking Heads were all nervous energy, detached emotion, and subdued minimalism. When they released their last album about 12 years later, the band had recorded everything from art-funk to polyrhythmic worldbeat explorations and simple, melodic guitar pop. Between their first album in 1977 and their last in 1988, Talking Heads became one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the \\'80s, while managing to earn several pop hits. While some of their music can seem too self-consciously experimental, clever, and intellectual for its own good, at their best Talking Heads represent everything good about art-school punks.And they were literally art-school punks. Guitarist/vocalist David Byrne, drummer Chris Frantz, and bassist Tina Weymouth met at the Rhode Island School of Design in the early \\'70s; they decided to move to New York in 1974 to concentrate on making music. The next year, the band won a spot opening for the Ramones at the seminal New York punk club CBGB. In 1976, keyboardist Jerry Harrison, a former member of Jonathan Richman\\'s Modern Lovers, was added to the lineup. By 1977, the band had signed to Sire Records and released its first album, Talking Heads: 77. It received a considerable amount of acclaim for its stripped-down rock &amp; roll, particularly Byrne\\'s geeky, overly intellectual lyrics and uncomfortable, jerky vocals.For their next album, 1978\\'s More Songs About Buildings and Food, the band worked with producer Brian Eno, recording a set of carefully constructed, arty pop songs, distinguished by extensive experimenting with combined acoustic and electronic instruments, as well as touches of surprisingly credible funk. On their next album, the Eno-produced Fear of Music, Talking Heads began to rely heavily on their rhythm section, adding flourishes of African-styled polyrhythms. This approach came to a full fruition with 1980\\'s Remain in Light, which was again produced by Eno. Talking Heads added several sidemen, including a horn section, leaving them free to explore their dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics.After a long tour, the band concentrated on solo projects for a couple of years. By the time of 1983\\'s Speaking in Tongues, the band had severed its ties with Eno; the result was an album that still relied on the rhythmic innovations of Remain in Light, except within a more rigid pop-song structure. After its release, Talking Heads embarked on another extensive tour, which was captured on the Jonathan Demme-directed concert film Stop Making Sense. After releasing the straightforward pop album Little Creatures in 1985, Byrne directed his first movie, True Stories, the following year; the band\\'s next album featured songs from the film. Two years later, Talking Heads released Naked, which marked a return to their worldbeat explorations, although it sometimes suffered from Byrne\\'s lyrical pretensions.After its release, Talking Heads were put on \"hiatus\"; Byrne pursued some solo projects, as did Harrison, and Frantz and Weymouth continued with their side project, Tom Tom Club. In 1991, the band issued an announcement that they had broken up. Shortly thereafter, Harrison\\'s production took off with successful albums by Live and Crash Test Dummies. In 1996, the original lineup minus Byrne reunited for the album No Talking Just Head; Byrne sued Frantz, Weymouth, and Harrison for attempting to record and perform as Talking Heads, so the trio went by the Heads. In 1999, all four worked together to promote a 15th-anniversary edition of Stop Making Sense, and they also performed at the 2002 induction ceremony for their entrance into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Through the 2010s, Byrne released a number of solo and collaborative projects. Tom Tom Club continued to tour, while Harrison produced albums for the likes of No Doubt, the Von Bondies, and Hockey. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'Supertramp followed an unusual path to commercial success in the 1970s, fusing the stylistic ambition and instrumental dexterity of progressive rock with the wit and tuneful melodies of British pop, and the results made them one of the most popular British acts of the \\'70s and ‘80s, topping the charts and filling arenas around the world at a time when their style of music was supposed to have fallen out of fashion.Supertramp was formed in 1969 by pianist and vocalist Rick Davies. Davies had been a member of a group called the Joint, who had found a financial backer in Dutch millionaire Stanley August Miesegaes; Miesegaes had grown disenchanted with the Joint, but saw promise in Davies, and he offered to bankroll a new band if Davies wanted to launch a fresh project. Davies placed an ad in the British music weekly Melody Maker, and recruited guitarist Richard Palmer, percussionist Robert Millar, and vocalist/bassist Roger Hodgson. Davies initially dubbed the new band Daddy, but to avoid comparison with a number of other paternally named acts, he changed their billing to Supertramp, taking the name from a book by Welsh author William Henry Davies.In 1970, Supertramp signed a deal with A&amp;M Records, and their debut album was released later the same year. Dominated by extended prog-based compositions, the album didn\\'t win a large audience, and Supertramp\\'s lineup shifted, as Richard Palmer and Robert Millar left the group, Hodgson moved from bass to guitar, and bassist Frank Farrell, percussionist Kevin Currie, and Dave Winthrop on flue and sax joined the act. The new edition of Supertramp released the album Indelibly Stamped in 1971, but it fared little better in the marketplace than the debut, and Miesegaes cut off his funding of the group. Left to their own devices, Supertramp came close to collapse as most of the group\\'s members moved on, but Davies and Hodgson put together a new version of the group -- Davies on piano and vocals, Hodgson on guitar, electric piano, and vocals, Dougie Thomson on bass, Bob C. Benberg on drums and percussion, and John Anthony Helliwell on sax, woodwinds, and keyboards. This edition of Supertramp boasted a more concise and pop-oriented sound than the band that recorded the first two albums, and 1974\\'s Crime of the Century became Supertramp\\'s commercial breakthrough, spawning the singles \"Dreamer\" and \"Bloody Well Right.\" 1975\\'s Crisis? What Crisis? didn\\'t fare quite as well commercially, but 1977\\'s Even in the Quietest Moments earned the band another hit single in \"Give a Little Bit,\" and Supertramp\\'s steady road work earned them a reputation as an impressive live act.1979\\'s Breakfast in America elevated Supertramp to true superstar status; three of its songs (\"Goodbye Stranger,\" \"Take the Long Way Home,\" and \"The Logical Song\") would became Top 20 hits, and the album went to number one on the Billboard charts, selling four million copies in the United States and reaching platinum status in Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Supertramp followed the success of Breakfast in America with a live album, 1980\\'s Paris, but it wasn\\'t until 1982 that the group released a new studio LP, Famous Last Words, and in a sense the title was prophetic -- the working relationship between Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson had become contentious, and in 1983, Hodgson, the lead vocalist on the band\\'s biggest hits, left to pursue a solo career. With Davies taking the lead, Supertramp released Brother Where You Bound in 1985, which found the band easing back on their pop side and exploring their progressive influences; the album also featured guest appearances from Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour. 1987\\'s Free as a Bird found Supertramp experimenting with synthesizers and electronic dance music, but after a world tour in support of the album, Davies quietly retired the band.In 1996, Davies re-assembled Supertramp for a concert tour; the new lineup featured Davies, John Anthony Helliwell, guitarist Mark Hart (who had toured with the band in support of Free as a Bird), and percussionist Jesse Siebenberg. The new Supertramp went into the studio after the tour, and Some Things Never Change was released in 1997. More touring followed, which was documented on the album Live 1997. Another studio set, Slow Motion, appeared in 2002. In 2010, Supertramp regrouped for a world tour to celebrate their fortieth anniversary, but while rumors suggested Hodgson might rejoin the band for the occasion, both he and Davies issued statements saying they were not likely to ever work together again, and Hodgson mounted a solo tour concurrently with Supertramp\\'s anniversary celebration. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi'\n",

      "'By pitching their music somewhere between the arena-friendly style of U2 and the mature pop/rock of bands like Maroon 5 and Counting Crows, the Fray rose to commercial prominence with their 2005 debut, How to Save a Life. The Denver-based band had formed three years prior, when former schoolmates Isaac Slade (vocals, piano) and Joe King (guitar, vocals) unexpectedly bumped into each other at a local music store. The pair began a series of two-man jam sessions and soon expanded their lineup with two of Slade\\'s former bandmates, drummer Ben Wysocki and guitarist David Welsh. Slade\\'s younger brother, Caleb, also joined the band for a time but was ultimately asked to leave; the resulting rift between the two siblings would later inspire the band\\'s first hit single, \"Over My Head (Cable Car).\" After issuing the Movement EP in 2002, the quartet gained the support of Denver\\'s KTCL radio station with a follow-up release, 2003\\'s Reason EP. As the Fray\\'s airplay increased alongside their local profile (Westword, a Denver alternative weekly publication, deemed them Best New Band in 2004), they began attracting attention from Epic Records. The label ultimately signed the band in December 2004, and the Fray toured alongside Weezer and Ben Folds the following summer. How to Save a Life was released in September 2005, and \"Over My Head (Cable Car)\" found a quick home on modern rock radio. By early 2006, it had crossed over to Top 40 chart status, peaking at number eight and whetting the public\\'s appetite for another hit. The Fray responded by releasing the album\\'s title track, which was heavily used in a promotional campaign for the TV series Grey\\'s Anatomy and quickly became one of 2006\\'s biggest singles. \"How to Save a Life\" was a worldwide smash, reaching the Top Ten in the U.S. (where it continued to chart for 58 consecutive weeks) and peaking at number one in Bulgaria, Ireland, Canada, and Spain. By the time the smoke had cleared, the Fray\\'s debut had been certified double-platinum in the U.S. and was declared the best-selling digital album of all time. As How to Save a Life continued to enjoy worldwide chart success, the live album Live at the Electric Factory was released in selected independent stores in July 2006. The Fray re-released their Reason EP the following year while continuing to tour, occasionally playing new material at their high-profile shows. The band also found time to return to the recording studio, and 2009 saw the release of their self-titled sophomore effort, The Fray. The band\\'s third studio outing was produced by Brendan O\\'Brien and was inspired by the group\\'s trips to Rwanda and Germany. The resulting Scars and Stories, which was named after an unused B-side, was preceded by the single \"Heartbeat\" and released on February 7, 2012. At the end of the year, frontman Isaac Slade confirmed the band was starting work on its fourth record, and the Fray subsequently headed into the studio with producer Stuart Price (the Killers, Madonna, Keane). The resulting Helios, released in 2014, received mixed reviews, but introduced some new fan favorites into the Fray lexicon via the stadium-ready singles \"Love Don\\'t Die\" and \"Break Your Plans.\" Two years later saw the release of Through the Years: The Best of the Fray, a career retrospective that included a new single, \"Singing Low.\" ~ Andrew Leahey'\n",

      "'Survivor\\'s brand of melodic, hard, album-oriented rock netted the group several hits during the 1980s, including two smash themes from Rocky films. Survivor was founded in 1978 by guitarist/keyboardist Jim Peterik (formerly the lead singer of the Ides of March) with guitarist Frankie Sullivan; the two recruited lead singer Dave Bickler and recorded a self-titled debut album as a trio with studio musicians Dennis Johnson on bass and Gary Smith on drums. Their places were taken by permanent members Stephen Ellis and Marc Droubay, respectively.The group\\'s big break came in 1982 when Sylvester Stallone commissioned the band to write the theme to Rocky III; the result, \"Eye of the Tiger,\" was an instant hit with its bombastic opening riff and anthemic chorus. It spent six weeks at number one on the Billboard charts and pushed the accompanying album of the same name over the one million sales mark. Bickler quit in 1983 due to medical reasons and was replaced by former Cobra singer Jimi Jamison. The shakeup gave the band a kick-start, and they had two Top Ten hits in 1985 with \"High on You\" and \"The Search Is Over.\" The band\\'s theme from Rocky IV, \"Burning Heart,\" provided their second biggest hit in 1986, but their fortunes slid downhill from there; by the end of the year, Jamison, Peterik, and Sullivan were the only remaining members, and Survivor finally disbanded in 1989.Bickler, Sullivan, Ellis, and Droubay returned to the studio as Survivor in 1997, and Jamison returned to the lineup as well in 2000. Aside from touring, Survivor released the studio album Reach in 2006, but Jamison left the band soon after. He was replaced by Robin McAuley, who spent several years with the band. By 2011, however, Jamison was a member of the band again -- alongside Sullivan, Droubay, Billy Ozzello, and Walter Tolentino -- and two years after that, Bickler was back in the fold as well. Although the band visited the studio and recorded several times during the 2010s, nothing appeared before the sudden death of Jamison from a heart attack in August 2014. ~ Steve Huey, Rovi'\n",

      "'With their nervy and literate indie rock sound, Arctic Monkeys arrived with a blast in 2005. Assisted by rave reviews and online word of mouth (they were one of the first bands to benefit from social media), they quickly became a sensation in the United Kingdom, where they were seen as the heir apparent to the throne left vacant by Oasis and the Libertines. Buoyed by the single \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,\" their 2006 debut Whatever People Say I Am, That\\'s What I\\'m Not briefly grabbed the title of fastest-selling album in British history. It landed on top of both the U.K. and U.S. rock album charts and took home the Mercury Prize. What set the group apart was Alex Turner, a singer/songwriter with a biting wit and grasp of English vernacular (not dissimilar to Paul Weller, the godfather of modern British rock). However, driven by their maverick creative spirit, Arctic Monkeys have proven highly unpredictable, reworking classic rock traditions on 2007\\'s Favourite Worst Nightmare and beefing up their guitars with the assistance of Queens of the Stone Age\\'s Josh Homme on 2009\\'s Humbug. Eventually, they also laced in some of the louche lounge aspects of Turner\\'s swinging side project the Last Shadow Puppets, an evolution that began on 2018\\'s arty Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino and deepened on its 2022 follow-up The Car. By that point, the band was a staple throughout the world: a respected, adventurous, and successful group that could easily be called Britain\\'s biggest band of the early 21st century.Alex Turner and guitarist Jamie Cook began their music careers in 2001, when the friends both received guitars for Christmas. Two years later, they began performing shows around their native Sheffield with drummer Matt Helders and bassist Andy Nicholson, two fellow students at Stocksbridge High School. A series of demo recordings followed, and Arctic Monkeys\\' audience swelled as fans circulated those recordings via the Internet. The musicians soon found themselves at the center of a growing media circus, with such outlets as BBC Radio examining the band\\'s music and mounting hype.By distributing their homemade material on the Internet, Arctic Monkeys were able to build a sizable fan base without the help of a record label, effectively circumventing the usual road to superstardom. They continued to buck tradition by signing with Domino Records in 2005, eschewing a major-label\\'s budget for Domino\\'s D.I.Y. cred and hip roster (which also included Franz Ferdinand, a touchstone for the band\\'s sound). The smart moves paid off as Arctic Monkeys\\' first two singles -- \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" and \"When the Sun Goes Down\" -- both topped the U.K. charts. Critical reception was similarly favorable, but few could have predicted the whirlwind success of the band\\'s debut album, which ousted Oasis\\' Definitely Maybe as the fastest-selling debut in British history (a record that was broken one year later by Leona Lewis\\' Spirit). Whatever People Say I Am, That\\'s What I\\'m Not sold 363,735 copies during its first week alone, transforming Arctic Monkeys from underground stars into mainstream figures. Arctic Monkeys\\' debut sold approximately 300,000 total copies in America -- enough to warrant more media coverage. Their success continued as they released a spring EP, Who the F**k Are Arctic Monkeys, and prepared for a stateside tour. Temporary bassist Nick O\\'Malley was brought aboard for the band\\'s American shows, while a fatigued Nicholson stayed at home. Nicholson then announced his official departure when the band returned home in June 2006, and O\\'Malley remained with Arctic Monkeys as a permanent member. That fall, the guys received the 2006 Mercury Prize and donated the accompanying money to an undisclosed charity. Additional accolades included Best British Breakthrough Act at the BRIT Awards and Best New Band at the NME Awards. NME also made a bold assertion by deeming the group\\'s debut one of the Top Five British albums ever released.Released in April 2007, Favourite Worst Nightmare updated Arctic Monkeys\\' sound with louder instruments and faster tempos. The bandmates had recorded the sophomore album quickly, wishing to return to the road as soon as possible, and the speedy turnaround between records helped maintain the group\\'s popularity at home. Favourite Worst Nightmare sold 85,000 copies during its first day of release, and all 12 tracks entered the Top 200 of the U.K. singles charts. As Alex Turner briefly turned his attention to a side project, the Last Shadow Puppets, Arctic Monkeys received another Mercury Prize nomination and took home two titles at the 2008 BRIT Awards. Recording sessions for a third album commenced in early 2008 and lasted throughout the year, with producers James Ford (who previously worked with Turner on the Last Shadow Puppets\\' album) and Josh Homme (frontman of Queens of the Stone Age) adding some newfound heft to the band\\'s sound. Meanwhile, Arctic Monkeys released a concert album entitled At the Apollo -- with accompanying video footage captured on 35mm film -- before unveiling Humbug in August 2009. Humbug went platinum in the U.K. with the singles \"Crying Lightning\" peaking at number 12 and \"Cornerstone\" topping out at 94. The band hit the road that February, kicking off a multi-leg tour that ran through the rest of the year. After playing another handful of shows in early 2010, the guys took a short hiatus before reconvening with James Ford for their fourth album. Sessions began that fall, and the resulting Suck It and See arrived in spring 2011, topping the U.K. album chart and landing at number 14 on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, Turner also wrote music for a Richard Ayoade film, Submarine, whose soundtrack doubled as the frontman\\'s first solo release.In February 2012, Arctic Monkeys released a song entitled \"R U Mine?\" on their YouTube channel, which indicated that an album was on the way. A few months later, the band played at the London Summer Olympics opening ceremony, performing \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" and the Beatles\\' \"Come Together,\" but it wasn\\'t until the summer of 2013 that the group\\'s fifth album was to be revealed. Entitled AM, the record was released in September, a few months after a triumphant headlining performance at Glastonbury 2013, which was opened with the new song \"Do I Wanna Know?\" Both a critical and commercial success, AM topped the British charts and reached number six on the Billboard 200. It also earned the group a Mercury Prize nomination and won British Album of the Year at the BRIT Awards.Following the end of their tour in 2014, the band entered an extended hiatus, during which time the individual members pursued solo projects. In 2016, Turner released his second album with the Last Shadow Puppets and toured. Arctic Monkeys resurfaced in April 2018 with the loungey Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino, a softer affair than their previous albums. Along with topping the U.K. album chart and Billboard Top Rock Albums chart, the LP became the group\\'s fourth to earn a Mercury Prize nomination. Later that year, the band issued the TBH&amp;C B-side \"Anyways\" as a single. A concert album, Live at the Royal Albert Hall, recorded during the Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino tour arrived in November 2020, with all proceeds going to benefit the War Child U.K. charity organization. Arctic Monkeys began their seventh album cycle by releasing the single \"There\\'d Better Be a Mirrorball\" in August 2022, delivering the full-length The Car in October. Continuing the slow, stylish vibe of Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, the album was cut in a monastery on the coast of Suffolk. ~ Andrew Leahey &amp; Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "\"After a worldwide arena tour, the release of their 2018 UK Top Ten album ‘Let's Go Sunshine' saw The Kooks topping the bill at festivals across Europe and at home. The streaming boom had opened the Brighton band up to a new audience of young fans who loved their distinctive brand of indie rock. Coming off the back of a punishing tour schedule, frontman, Luke Pritchard vowed to take a bit of a breather. But instead, found himself right back in the studio. Spending much of his time in Berlin, Pritchard found himself working on The Kooks behemoth of a sixth album, ‘10 Tracks To Echo In The Dark'. Flirting with genres from 80s synth-pop to funk to prog rock, the album is still, at its core, an indie record, and a Kooks one, at that. It's a record that takes that classic Kooks sound and adds something of a retro-futurist slant – both sonically and in mindset. It's an album about being hopeful and seeing the great in the world, despite the darkness. You get a sense that we're hearing from a new Pritchard – one whose demons are behind him and is optimistic about the future. The band have been experimental over the years – something that has been key to their longevity, but getting back to what people love about The Kooks was front of Pritchard's mind. As The Kooks continue to reach an ever-growing audience of young fans, ‘10 Tracks To Echo In The Dark' feels like a mission statement. It's a celebration of getting through troubled times and a rallying cry for our future.\"\n",

      "'The Smiths were the definitive British indie rock band of the \\'80s, marking the end of synth-driven new wave and the beginning of the guitar rock that dominated English rock into the \\'90s. Sonically, the group was indebted to the British Invasion, crafting ringing, melodic three-minute pop singles even for their album tracks. But their scope was far broader than that of a revivalist band. The group\\'s core members, vocalist Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, were obsessive rock fans inspired by the D.I.Y. ethics of punk, but they also had a fondness for girl groups, pop, and rockabilly. Morrissey and Marr also represented one of the strangest teams of collaborators in rock history. Marr was the rock traditionalist, looking like an elegant version of Keith Richards during the Smiths\\' heyday and meticulously layering his guitar tracks in the studio. Morrissey, on the other hand, broke from rock tradition by singing in a keening, self-absorbed croon, embracing the forlorn, romantic poetry of Oscar Wilde, publicly declaring his celibacy, and making no secret of his disgust for most of his peers. While it eventually led to the Smiths\\' early demise, the friction between Morrissey and Marr resulted in a flurry of singles and albums over the course of three years that provided the blueprint for British guitar rock in the following decade.Before forming the Smiths in 1982, Johnny Marr had played in a variety of Manchester-based rock &amp; roll bands, including Sister Ray, Freaky Part, White Dice, and Paris Valentinos. On occasion, Marr had come close to a record contract -- one of his bands won a competition Stiff Records held to have Nick Lowe \"produce your band\" -- but he never quite made the leap. Though Morrissey had sung for a few weeks with the Nosebleeds and auditioned for Slaughter &amp; the Dogs, he had primarily contented himself with being a passionate, vocal fan of both music and film. During his teens, he wrote to Melody Maker frequently, often getting his letters published. He had written the biography/tribute James Dean Isn\\'t Dead, which was published by the local Manchester publishing house Babylon Books in the late \\'70s, as well as another book on the New York Dolls; he was also the president of the English New York Dolls fan club. Morrissey met Marr, who was then looking for a lyricist, through mutual friends in the spring of 1982. The pair began writing songs, eventually recording some demos with the Fall\\'s drummer, Simon Wolstencroft. By the fall, the duo had settled on the name the Smiths and recruited Marr\\'s schoolmate Andy Rourke as their bassist and Mike Joyce as their drummer. The Smiths made their live debut late in 1982, and by the spring of 1983, the group had earned a small but loyal following in their hometown of Manchester and had begun to make inroads in London. Rejecting a record deal with the Mancunian Factory Records, the band signed with Rough Trade for a one-off single, \"Hand in Glove.\" With its veiled references to homosexuality and its ringing riffs, \"Hand in Glove\" became an underground sensation in the U.K., topping the independent charts and earning the praise of the U.K. music weeklies. Soon, Morrissey\\'s performances became notorious as he appeared on-stage wearing a hearing aid and with gladioli stuffed in his back pockets. His interviews were becoming famous for his forthright, often contrary opinions, which helped the band become a media sensation. By the time of the group\\'s second single, \"This Charming Man,\" in late 1983, the Smiths had already been the subject of controversy over \"Reel Around the Fountain,\" a song that had been aired on a BBC radio session and was alleged to condone child abuse. It was the first time that Morrissey\\'s detached, literary, and ironic lyrics were misinterpreted, and it wouldn\\'t be the last.\"This Charming Man\" reached number 25 on the British charts in December of 1983, setting the stage for \"What Difference Does It Make\"\\'s peak at number 12 in February. The Smiths\\' rise to the upper reaches of the British charts was swift, and the passion of their fans, as well as the U.K. music press, indicated that the group had put an end to the synth-powered new wave that dominated Britain in the early \\'80s. After rejecting their initial stab at a first album, they released their debut, The Smiths, in the spring of 1984 to strong reviews and sales -- it peaked at number two. A few months later, the group backed \\'60s pop vocalist Sandie Shaw -- who Morrissey had publicly praised in an article -- on a version of \"Hand in Glove\" that was released and reached the Top 40. \"Heaven Knows I\\'m Miserable Now\" reached number ten, becoming their highest-charting single amid a storm of controversy about its B-side, \"Suffer Little Children,\" which was about the notorious Moors Murders. More controversy arose when Morrissey denounced the hunger-relief efforts of Band Aid, but the group\\'s popularity was not affected. Though the Smiths had become the most popular new rock &amp; roll group in Britain, they failed to make it outside of underground and college radio in the U.S., partially because they never launched a full-scale tour. At the end of the year, \"William It Was Really Nothing\" became a Top 20 hit and Hatful of Hollow, a collection of B-sides, BBC sessions, and non-LP singles, went to the Top Ten, followed shortly by \"How Soon Is Now,\" which peaked at number 24.Meat Is Murder, the band\\'s second proper studio album, entered the British charts at number one in February of 1985, despite some criticism that it was weaker than The Smiths. Around the time of the release of Meat Is Murder, Morrissey\\'s interviews were becoming increasingly political as he trashed the Thatcher administration and campaigned for vegetarianism; he even claimed that the Smiths were all vegetarians, and he forbade the remaining members to be photographed eating meat, even though they were still carnivores. Marr, for his part, was delving deeply into the rock &amp; roll lifestyle and looked increasingly like a cross between Keith Richards and Brian Jones. By the time the non-LP \"Shakespeare\\'s Sister\" reached number 26 in the spring of 1985, the Smiths had spawned a rash of soundalike bands, including James, who opened for the group on their spring 1985 tour, most of whom Morrissey supported. However, all of the media attention on the Smiths launched a mild backlash later in 1985, when \"That Joke Isn\\'t Funny Anymore\" was pulled from Meat Is Murder and failed to reach the Top 40. \"The Boy with the Thorn in His Side\" revived the band\\'s fortunes in the fall of 1985, and their third album, The Queen Is Dead, confirmed their popularity upon its release in the spring of 1986. Greeted with enthusiastic reviews and peaking at number two on the U.K. charts, The Queen Is Dead also expanded their cult following in the U.S., cracking the Top 100. Shortly before the album was completed, former Aztec Camera guitarist Craig Gannon became the band\\'s rhythm guitarist, and he played with the band throughout their 1986 international tour, including a botched American tour. The non-LP \"Panic,\" which was criticized as racist by some observers for its repeated refrain of \"Burn down the disco...hang the DJ,\" reached number 11 late in the summer. A few months after its release, Marr was seriously injured in a car crash. During his recuperation, Gannon was fired from the band, as was Rourke, who was suffering from heroin addiction. Though Rourke was later reinstated, Gannon was never replaced.The Smiths may have been at the height of their popularity in early 1987, with the non-LP singles \"Shoplifters of the World\" and \"Sheila Take a Bow\" reaching number 11 and ten respectively, and the singles and B-sides compilation The World Won\\'t Listen (revamped for U.S. release as Louder Than Bombs later in 1987) debuting at number two, but Marr was growing increasingly disenchanted with the band and the music industry. Over the course of the year, Morrissey and Marr became increasingly irritated with each other. The singer wished that Marr would stop playing with other artists like Bryan Ferry and Billy Bragg, while the guitarist was frustrated with Morrissey\\'s devotion to \\'60s pop and his hesitancy to explore new musical directions. A few weeks before the release of Strangeways, Here We Come, Marr announced that he was leaving the Smiths. Morrissey disbanded the group shortly afterward and began a solo career, signing with Parlophone in the U.K. and staying with the Smiths\\' U.S. label, Reprise. Marr played as a sideman with a variety of artists, eventually forming Electronic with New Order frontman Bernard Sumner. Rourke retired from recording and Joyce became a member of the reunited Buzzcocks in 1991.Rank, a live album recorded on the Queen Is Dead tour, was released in the fall of 1988. It debuted at number two in the U.K. A widely criticized, two-part The Best of the Smiths compilation was released in 1992; the praised Singles compilation was released in 1995. Joyce and Rourke sued Morrissey and Marr in 1991, claiming they received only ten-percent of the group\\'s earnings while the songwriters received 40-percent. Rourke eventually settled out of court, but Joyce won his case in late 1996. While the group remained estranged, in September 2022, Marr performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City, with Rourke sitting in on bass. It would be one of Andy Rourke\\'s final public appearances; he died after a long bout with pancreatic cancer on May 19, 2023. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "'By cannily synthesizing many of the sonic signifiers of alternative rock, Cage the Elephant became one of the biggest rock bands of the 2010s. The Kentucky natives relocated to England just before the 2008 release of their eponymous debut, and the ensuing media boost resulted in the transatlantic hit \"Ain\\'t No Rest for the Wicked,\" a clever pop tune that sounded like a hybrid between the White Stripes and Beck. The group soon became a reliable fixture on American modern rock radio, with two albums going gold (2011\\'s Thank You Happy Birthday and 2013\\'s Melophobia), and a Grammy Award for their 2015 album, the Dan Auerbach-produced Tell Me I\\'m Pretty. It was all proof that Cage the Elephant had become one of the rare popular mainstream rock groups of their time.Formed by Matt Shultz, Brad Shultz, Jared Champion, Lincoln Parish, and Daniel Tichenor, the group signed with Relentless and released the \"Free Love\" single late in 2007. A support slot for the Pigeon Detectives beckoned in early 2008, and follow-up single \"Ain\\'t No Rest for the Wicked\" reached the Top 40 in June. The group\\'s self-titled debut followed soon after, becoming a respectable commercial and critical success.Two years later the band returned with the single \"Shake Me Down,\" while early 2011 saw the release of second album Thank You Happy Birthday, which debuted at number two on the album charts. In early 2012, the band released the live audio/video package Live from the Vic in Chicago, which captured performances from their sold-out two-night run at the famous Chicago venue. Returning to the studio, the band recorded its third album, Melophobia. Released in October 2013, the album saw Cage collaborating with Alison Mosshart (the Kills, the Dead Weather) and featured the modern rock radio hit \"Come a Little Closer.\" During the Melophobia era, Cage the Elephant parted ways with their founding guitarist, Lincoln Parish, who became a producer for other artists in Nashville.In late 2015, the band released its fourth album, Tell Me I\\'m Pretty, which was produced by the Black Keys\\' Dan Auerbach. The ensemble embarked on both nationwide and European tours in promotion of the record throughout 2016 to rapturous success; the album would later win the Grammy for Best Rock Album in 2017. Cage the Elephant continued performing throughout early 2017 with a series of intimate, stripped-down, unplugged shows around the States that spanned their entire back catalog. The performances were captured and chronicled in their second live release, Unpeeled, which arrived in the early summer of 2017.Cage the Elephant returned in 2019 with Social Cues, which was heavily influenced by Matt Shultz\\'s divorce. Exploring dark emotions, the album was produced by John Hill and included the single \"Ready to Let Go\" along with \"Night Running,\" featuring Beck. At the end of the year, Hill received a Grammy nomination for his work on the album and Social Cues was nominated for Best Rock Album. ~ Chris True, Rovi'\n",

      "'Formed in 2003 in the suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland, All Time Low started out as a high school cover band before morphing into a melodic pop-punk act influenced by predecessors like New Found Glory and blink-182. An enduring presence in the late-2000s scene, they were a Warped Tour mainstay from their breakthrough sophomore set, So Wrong, It\\'s Right (2007), to their chart-peaking sixth LP Future Hearts (2015). Following a late-career dip into pop with 2017\\'s Last Young Renegade, they returned to their pop-punk roots in the early 2020s with Wake Up, Sunshine and Tell Me I\\'m Alive.Singer/guitarist Alex Gaskarth and guitarist Jack Barakat were All Time Low\\'s co-founders, with bassist Zack Merrick and drummer Rian Dawson rounding out their energetic pop-punk sound and rowdy live shows, which often included silly string and beach balls. Honing their skills between homework and other teenage commitments, the guys managed to tour across the East Coast and the South during school breaks. They issued a four-song EP, 2004\\'s The Three Words to Remember in Dealing with the End, with help from local label Emerald Moon, and followed its release with a full-length album, The Party Scene, one year later. Touring across the country that summer, the guys found themselves on bills with similar acts like Motion City Soundtrack, the Early November, and Plain White T\\'s. Along the way, All Time Low also bumped into fellow pop-punkers Amber Pacific, who brought the young band to the attention of their label, Hopeless Records. The label was immediately impressed, and All Time Low had officially become part of the Hopeless family by March 2006, just a few months shy of the members\\' high-school graduation. Finally done with schoolwork and able to concentrate full-time on music, the group issued Put Up or Shut Up -- a seven-song EP that mostly featured new recordings of older material -- that July. All Time Low supported the EP\\'s release with a handful of Warped Tour dates before hitting the road again with Amber Pacific. So Wrong, It\\'s Right appeared in 2007, marking the band\\'s first full-length release for Hopeless. After being named 2008\\'s Band of the Year by Alternative Press, All Time Low returned with their second album, Nothing Personal, in July 2009. Debuting at number four on the Billboard charts, Nothing Personal helped make All Time Low one of the top emo-pop acts in the business. Two CD/DVD packages, MTV Unplugged and Straight to DVD, were released the following year, tiding fans over while the guys returned to the studio to begin work on their major-label debut for Interscope Records. Dirty Work, featuring the single \"I Feel Like Dancin\\',\" was released in 2011. The album reached number six on the Billboard charts the week it was released, and the band hit the road. In 2012, All Time Low announced they had parted ways with Interscope and released a new song, \"The Reckless and the Brave,\" on their website in June. Soon after, they re-signed with Hopeless and began work on a new album. Don\\'t Panic was released in November 2012, then reissued almost a year later with four newly recorded songs and four acoustic versions under the name Don\\'t Panic: It\\'s Longer Now! In 2015, All Time Low returned with their sixth record, Future Hearts, which found them reuniting with their Dirty Work producer, John Feldmann. In 2016, they released Straight to DVD 2: Past, Present &amp; Future, a sequel to the 2010 live album. In February 2017, All Time Low issued the single \"Dirty Laundry\" in anticipation of their seventh studio long-player, Last Young Renegade, that arrived in June of that year. Renegade was their first effort issued on Fueled by Ramen and featured the singles \"Nice2KnoU\" and the pop-focused \"Life of the Party.\" Their fifth consecutive Top Ten record, the set\\'s unabashed pop polish proved divisive and, after the era came to a close, the band got to work on a course-correcting follow-up.In 2018, the summery and anthemic one-off single \"Everything Is Fine\" offered a taste of things to come with album number eight, which landed in early 2020. Wake Up, Sunshine saw All Time Low returning to their pop-punk roots after a brief pop foray on 2017\\'s Renegade. Featuring appearances by blackbear and the Band Camino, the upbeat LP reached number on Billboard\\'s Top Rock Albums chart, buoyed by singles like \"Some Kind of Disaster\" and \"Monster,\" the latter of which was re-released in December 2020 with guest vocals from Demi Lovato. The following year saw the band team up with English indie rockers Pale Waves for the single \"PMA\" before returning with 2022\\'s \"Sleepwalking.\" That pop-leaning track appeared on their ninth album, 2023\\'s Tell Me I\\'m Alive. ~ Corey Apar, Rovi'\n",

After three years of touring around the world and writing and recording new music, Phantogram returned earlier this summer with their comeback anthem “Into Happiness,” which Billboard hailed as “one of their poppiest tunes so far, a ghostly celebration of joy's triumph over depression.” The song and Floria Sigismondi-directed video also received praise from Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, COMPLEX, HYPEBEAST, Paste Magazine, PAPER Magazine and many more. They followed this up with their latest single, “Mister Impossible,” just in time for their summer North American tour and leading into more new music out this fall.\"\n",

      "'Record-breaking South Korean boy band BTS (aka Bangtan Boys) deliver an energetic blend of dance-pop and hip-hop with deeply introspective lyrics that helped them build a devoted global following while also making them one of the most successful Korean exports in the world. Debuting in the early 2010s with their Skool trilogy, they steadily expanded their audience until breaking into the mainstream consciousness with the Love Yourself series. After the platinum-certified Love Yourself: Tear became their first number one effort outside of their home country, the compilation Love Yourself: Answer found them topping charts in Canada and Japan. By 2020, international fervor reached a peak with their fourth release, Map of the Soul: 7, which topped the charts in over 20 countries. Hitting another milestone that summer, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to top the U.S. singles chart with their retro-disco track \"Dynamite\" from their chart-topping fifth set, Be. The following year, they notched three more Billboard number ones, including \"Butter\" and the Coldplay collaboration \"My Universe.\" A sprawling anthology, Proof, which chronicled their first decade, landed in the summer of 2022.Formed by producer Bang Si Hyuk, the septet\\'s lineup includes RM (Kim Namjoon), team leader and rapper; Jin (Kim Seokjin), singer; Suga (Min Yoongi), rapper; J-Hope (Jung Hoseok), rapper and choreographer; Jimin (Jimin Park), singer and choreographer; V (Kim Taehyung), singer; and Jungkook (Jungkook Jeon), singer, rapper, and choreographer. In addition to production and composition, the members of BTS also write their own lyrics, which tackle topics like mental health, self-acceptance, and empowerment. With their youthful blend of club-worthy dance anthems, stirring love ballads, and aggressive rapping, BTS connected with a devoted fan base (dubbed \"ARMY\") and set themselves apart from the K-pop industrial machine when they debuted in 2013 with the first installment of their \"School Trilogy\" series, 2 Cool 4 Skool. A few months later, they released the second EP of the saga, O!RUL8,2? The trilogy was completed with Skool Luv Affair, which was released around Valentine\\'s Day in 2014. Later that year, BTS issued their full-length debut album, Dark &amp; Wild, featuring the single \"Danger.\" As their fan base grew and international tours sold out, they released The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1 in April 2015 and the follow-up, Pt. 2, some months later in November. They embarked on a massive world tour as The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 2 topped a record-setting six international music charts, including Billboard\\'s World Albums chart. After four weeks, they set a record as the first K-pop act to achieve such a feat. The group continued to break records with the release of their sophomore LP, Wings. Released in late 2016, Wings not only became the first BTS effort to debut atop both the Korean album and song charts, but they were the third K-pop act to land in the Canadian Hot 100. However, the album\\'s impact was most apparent on the Billboard charts. The best showing to date for a K-pop act, Wings debuted in the Top 30 of the Billboard 200 -- both their highest U.S. chart debut and most sales to date -- making BTS the first K-pop artists with three albums to enter the main album charts. (Wings became their sixth Top Three hit -- and second number one -- on the World Albums chart.) They also became the first K-pop act to spend four weeks on the charts. Wings continued the artistic and creative growth for the septet, featuring seven solo tracks that showcased the personality of each member. Four months later, BTS re-released the album as You Never Walk Alone. The updated version added four new songs to the original Wings track listing, including the singles \"Spring Day\" and \"Not Today.\" With their presence in the United States continuing to expand, the group went on to win the Top Social Artist Award at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards. Their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her, arrived that September and became the first K-pop album to debut in the Billboard 200\\'s Top Ten, entering the chart at number seven.In early 2018, BTS received their first double-platinum certifications in Japan and became the first Korean act to receive two gold certifications in the U.S. That spring, they issued their third Japanese LP, Face Yourself, which featured Japanese versions of tracks from Wings and Love Yourself: Her. The set -- which included just two previously unreleased songs -- debuted just outside the Top 40 on the Billboard 200. The next month, BTS released their third official full-length, Love Yourself: Tear, which included the single \"Fake Love.\" Days later, they returned to the Billboard Music Awards, performing and winning Top Social Artist for the second year in a row. Their Billboard success continued when Love Yourself: Tear soared to the top of the Billboard 200, becoming the first foreign-language chart-topper on the U.S. chart in over a decade. BTS repeated the feat that summer with the conclusion to the trilogy, Love Yourself: Answer. The compilation featured a handful of new tracks, including lead single \"Idol,\" packaged with previously released songs from Her and Tear, as well as some remixes and a Nicki Minaj-assisted version of \"Idol.\" For their contributions to spreading Korea\\'s cultural influence around the world, each member of BTS was awarded cultural merit medals by government officials, the youngest recipients to ever be granted the honor.Riding the international success of the Love Yourself series, the boys closed the era with a sold-out global stadium tour, which primed them for the start of the next BTS wave: Map of the Soul: Persona. The first single from the 2019 album, \"Persona,\" showcased a solo RM referencing both Carl Jung and BTS\\' own 2014 track \"Intro: Skool Luv Affair,\" while the follow-up \"Boy with Luv\" recruited American singer Halsey. While \"Boy with Luv\" climbed into the Top Ten of the Hot 100, the album topped the Billboard 200, becoming BTS\\' third number one in a year. Before the next official release, the band found themselves the focus of a mobile game, BTS World. The accompanying companion album, BTS World: Original Soundtrack, included a new track by the crew, as well as a trio of collaborations with guests Charli XCX, Zara Larsson, and Juice WRLD. Not an official BTS album per se, the bulk of the set featured instrumental compositions by Kang Minkook, who wrote one theme song per BTS member, and showcased tracks by Korean indie duo Okdal and Big Hit labelmate Lee Hyun. Despite not being an actual BTS effort, the soundtrack still managed to land at number 72 on the Billboard 200 while simultaneously topping the Korean charts.After a brief hiatus from the spotlight, BTS returned in earnest in 2020. The same week that Love Yourself: Answer became the first South Korean album to be certified platinum in the U.S., they joined Lil Nas X on the Grammy Awards stage to perform RM\\'s \"Seoul Town Road\" version of the rapper\\'s hit single. The following month, the group released their fourth Korean-language LP and second number one U.S. hit, Map of the Soul: 7. The set merged highlights from Map of the Soul: Persona with over a dozen new tracks, including the single \"Black Swan\" and collaborations with Troye Sivan and Allie X (\"Louder Than Bombs\") and Sia (the digital-only \"On\"). They extended the Map of the Soul era in 2020 with their fourth Japanese-language effort, Map of the Soul: 7 - The Journey, which reimagined tracks from Map of the Soul: 7, Map of the Soul: Persona, and Love Yourself: Answer for their Japanese fans. As for English-speaking fans, the group released their first track sung entirely in that language later in the summer. The disco-funk \"Dynamite\" broke streaming records within hours of release and debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, making BTS the first all-South Korean act to top the U.S. chart. The same week, the group made their first appearance on the MTV Video Music Awards, performing \"Dynamite\" for a virtual audience. The track was the first taste of their next album era, which was inaugurated with the November release of Be. Recorded while in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the effort featured increased input by each member of the septet, which included songwriting, production, and overall design. The same week that Be became their fifth album to debut atop the Billboard 200, BTS also scored their second consecutive number one single with \"Life Goes On.\" To cap off a banner year, South Korea\\'s National Assembly passed a revised law that pushed the age for mandatory military service from 28 to 30, sparing Jin an early hiatus from the group and allowing them to continue contributing to South Korea\\'s GDP, of which almost $5 billion was attributed to BTS in 2019.In February 2021, BTS performed an MTV Unplugged set, which featured stripped-down takes on songs from Be (\"Dynamite,\" \"Telepathy,\" \"Blue &amp; Grey,\" and \"Life Goes On\") as well as a faithful rendition of Coldplay\\'s \"Fix You.\" Months later, the group returned with the Jungkook-penned single \"Film Out\" from their Japanese-language compilation BTS, The Best. By the time summer rolled around, the boys were ready with another English-language single, the Grammy-nominated \"Butter.\" Released in May, the track broke a streaming premiere record after amassing over 20 million views in an hour and went on to become the group\\'s fourth chart-topper on the Billboard Hot 100. Various remixes were released in \"Hotter,\" \"Sweeter,\" and \"Cooler\" versions -- as well as a standalone cut featuring a Megan Thee Stallion verse -- which kept the track planted at number one for weeks. Eventually released as a multi-format physical single, it was paired with the Ed Sheeran-penned song \"Permission to Dance,\" which hit number one in the U.S. and across Asia. Their third U.S. chart-topper of 2021 arrived in September when they joined Coldplay for \"My Universe\" from the English band\\'s Music of the Spheres. Capping yet another banner year, they took home Artist of the Year, Favorite Pop Group, and Favorite Pop Song at that November\\'s American Music Awards. That same month, BTS kicked off the U.S. portion of their Permission to Dance on Stage concert series in Los Angeles, concluding months later in April 2022 in Las Vegas. Just days before that Vegas residency, they performed \"Butter\" at the 64th Grammy Awards. That May, they took home an additional trio of Billboard Music Awards, making them the group with the most awards in the history of the show. Weeks later, BTS visited the White House to speak with President Joe Biden about the surge in Asian American hate crimes. In early June, the group celebrated their first decade together with the three-disc compilation Proof, which featured a handful of new tracks (including the top 20 Hot 100 single \"Yet to Come\") spread over a best-of disc, a disc of curated tracks personally chosen by each member, and a disc of demos and unreleased songs. A single, \"The Planet,\" arrived in May 2023 as part of the soundtrack to the animated film Bastions. ~ Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'\n",

      "'Florida Georgia Line came out of nowhere in 2012 to become the biggest country group of the new decade. The vehicle of their success was \"Cruise,\" a slick, shimmering ode to the wide-open road that became an unkillable crossover hit in 2013 and, eventually, the biggest country single of all time. They\\'d lose that record to Sam Hunt, whose \"Body Like a Back Road\" took the country crown in 2017, but they regained it the next year when \"Meant to Be,\" their duet with pop singer Bebe Rexha, stayed at the top of Billboard\\'s Hot Country Songs charts for 35 weeks. \"Meant to Be\" wasn\\'t Florida Georgia Line\\'s first genre-bending crossover hit. After \"Cruise\" broke through on its own merits, reaching 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, its life was extended thanks to a remix featuring rapper Nelly. This unexpected collaboration pushed the single all the way to number four on the Hot 100, but at that point it became clear that the appeal of Florida Georgia Line lay in their unabashedly polished pop perspective. Unlike some fellow contemporary country bros, the duo of Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard didn\\'t swagger; they were bright, sunny, and friendly, qualities showcased on subsequent hits \"Get Your Shine On\" and \"Round Here.\" Where some of their peers -- tagged as \"bro-country\" due to their macho swagger and frat-friendly sensibility -- stumbled on their second or third albums, Florida Georgia Line\\'s willingness to incorporate pop and hip-hop styles into their sound meant that they stayed on the top of the charts into the 2020s. Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard -- the former hails from Ormond Beach, Florida; the latter Monroe, Georgia, hence their band name -- met as students at Nashville\\'s Belmont University, and began writing songs together between classes. Soon, they were playing local clubs, quickly building a fan following on the Southeast club circuit and developing a sharp contemporary country sound. After self-releasing an EP of originals called Anything Like Me in December 2010, the duo signed a publishing and management deal with Big Loud Mountain, then entered the studio with producer Joey Moi to track an EP, It\\'z Just What We Do.It\\'z Just What We Do appeared in May 2012, preceded by the single \"Cruise.\" Within two months, the single debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, where it would reside for months on end. On December 15, 2012, it wound up topping the country charts for the first time. It would stay at the top for 24 weeks, shattering the previous long-held record of 21 weeks at the top, a record held jointly by Webb Pierce\\'s 1955 hit \"In the Jailhouse Now,\" Hank Snow\\'s 1950 \"I\\'m Movin\\' On,\" and Eddy Arnold\\'s 1947 \"I\\'ll Hold You in My Heart (\\'Til I Can Hold You in My Arms).\" As \"Cruise\" ruled the country charts, a pop-oriented remix featuring rapper Nelly appeared as a separate single, turning the song into a pop hit; it climbed all the way to four on the Hot 100. \"Cruise\" kept many other hits away from the number one position, and that included two subsequent singles by Florida Georgia Line: the January 2013 single \"Get Your Shine On\" and its sequel, \"Round Here.\" Both of these were huge hits, topping the Country Airplay chart on their way to platinum certification, but they were dwarfed by \"Cruise,\" which wound up selling over 6.5 million units on its way to becoming the biggest country single of all time. \"Cruise\" also won the 2013 CMA for Single of the Year, the same year Florida Georgia Line snagged Vocal Duo of the Year.Naturally, the accompanying Here\\'s to the Good Times album -- which was produced by Joey Moi, a producer who made the transition from Nickelback to Jake Owen in 2011 -- also became a hit, reaching number one on the Country Albums chart in the summer of 2013 on its way to double-platinum certification from the RIAA. Once \"Get Your Shine On,\" \"Round Here,\" and \"Stay\" finished their stays at number one on Billboard\\'s Country Airplay chart, the album was reissued as an expanded edition called Here\\'s to the Good Times...This Is How We Roll for the holiday season of 2013, with their number one duet with Luke Bryan called \"This Is How We Roll\" added to the album (which also reached number one on the country chart). Florida Georgia Line reunited with Joey Moi for their second album, Anything Goes. Preceded by the July single \"Dirt\" -- which would become their fifth number one hit -- Anything Goes debuted at number one upon its release in October 2014. Over the next year, the album spawned four additional Billboard country hits: \"Sun Daze,\" \"Sippin\\' on Fire,\" and \"Confession,\" which all hit number one, plus \"Anything Goes.\" Anything Goes kept Florida Georgia Line rolling into 2016, when they geared up to release their third album, Dig Your Roots. Produced like its predecessors by Joey Moi, Dig Your Roots produced three successive number one Country Airplay singles over the course of 2016 and 2017: the first single \"H.O.L.Y.,\" the Tim McGraw duet \"May We All,\" and the Backstreet Boys collaboration \"God, Your Mama, and Me.\" In October 2017, Florida Georgia Line duetted on \"Meant to Be,\" a single from Bebe Rexha, a pop singer on the rise. \"Meant to Be\" rocketed to number one on Billboard\\'s Country Airplay chart, eventually crossing over to number two on the Hot 100 in 2018, all on its way toward snatching back the title for most weeks at number one on the Hot Country Songs chart from Sam Hunt. With that honor once again bestowed upon Florida Georgia Line, the band started to roll out singles from a fourth album in the guise of a digital EP. First up was \"Simple,\" which appeared in June 2018 and eventually peaked at number one on the Country Airplay chart; it was accompanied by the digital-only \"Colorado.\" Another song, \"Talk You Out of It,\" was added to the ever-evolving untitled EP in July, followed by \"Sittin\\' Pretty\" in August. All these songs were featured on Can\\'t Say I Ain\\'t Country, the full-length album FGL delivered in February 2019. Can\\'t Say I Ain\\'t Country debuted at number four on Billboard\\'s Top 200 and number one on their Country charts. After its release, \"Talk You Out of It\" was worked at country radio, making it to number 11 on the Country Airplay charts. In October, FGL issued Acoustic Sessions, which offered new acoustic versions of 17 of their biggest songs. \"I Love My Country,\" the first new song Florida Georgia Line released since Can\\'t Say I Ain\\'t Country, appeared in March 2020. The single wound up anchoring the EP 6-Pack, which arrived that May. Much of 6-Pack also appeared on Life Rolls On, the early 2021 LP that also featured the Top Ten Country hit \"Long Live.\" ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine'\n",

With more time than ever to experiment in her writing process this past year, she began making demos and writing songs that not only utilized her abilities as a guitar player but that were deeply inspired by her heroes and the music she grew up listening to. From ages 3-7, she accompanied her mother's nu-metal band Wicked Wisdom on tour. The band featured powerful rock vocals and crushing guitars which paved the way for WILLOW's own musical tastes including My Chemical Romance, Paramore, Fall Out Boy and more. That early oughts pop-punk and emo influence isn't just heard throughout her forthcoming record, but also features some of WILLOW's heroes of the era such as Travis Barker, Avril Lavigne and more.

      "'Indie rock trio Foster the People make atmospheric, psychedelic, dance-oriented pop music. Formed in Los Angeles in 2009, the band\\'s single \"Pumped Up Kicks\" first received significant airplay on KROQ in 2010, and online attention soon followed. Early in 2011, they released a self-titled EP that featured the song, and after a slow climb, it peaked inside the Top Ten later that year. Also in 2011, Foster the People issued their full-length debut album, Torches, which hit number eight on the U.S. charts. Three years later, the band returned with their sophomore full-length, the Paul Epworth-produced Supermodel, which followed their debut into the Top Ten. Third album Sacred Hearts Club featured the single \"Sit Next to Me,\" which charted just outside the Top 40.Multi-instrumentalist and singer/songwriter Mark Foster initially began Foster the People as a solo project, but before long he added longtime friend Cubbie Fink on bass and drummer Mark Pontius to complete the lineup. The following year, their single \"Pumped Up Kicks\" was posted on their website, picking up considerable buzz online and significant airplay on KROQ, alongside packed performances at the Texas musical festival SXSW. This inevitably attracted the attention of major labels, and eventually the band signed to Columbia imprint Startime International. Early in 2011 they released a self-titled EP that featured \"Pumped Up Kicks,\" and with the major-label support, the song became a worldwide hit. Despite the rapid climb of the single, the bandmembers were afforded time to concentrate on writing their debut full-length, while \"Pumped Up Kicks\" grew in popularity and was featured on television shows including the likes of Gossip Girl, Homeland, and a host of commercials. Later that summer the band released its debut record, Torches, which was produced mainly by Greg Kurstin (Kelly Clarkson, Ellie Goulding), with Paul Epworth (Adele, Friendly Fires) also contributing to a handful of tracks. They then embarked on tours across North America and Europe to support its release. In 2012 they took home the Billboard Music Awards\\' Top Rock Song accolade, and were nominated for a host of other honors, including Grammy, BRIT, NME, and Teen Choice awards. Foster the People began writing material for their sophomore record while on tour, and they laid tracks down on a portable setup before they entered the studio. Their sophomore album, the Paul Epworth-produced Supermodel, was released in March 2014. The album received middling reviews, but performed better than its predecessor, reaching number three on the U.S. album chart. Two singles, \"Coming of Age\" and \"Best Friend,\" hit the Top Ten of the alternative chart. The following year, Fink left the band, with the rest of Foster the People issuing the single \"The Unforeseeable Fate of Mr. Jones\" that December. In 2016, the group debuted material from its upcoming third album in concert, and eventually released three of those songs on an EP in April 2017. In July 2017 they delivered the full-length Sacred Hearts Club, which found them exploring a funky, electronic, \\'80s-style R&amp;B vibe. Produced by Foster and keyboardist Isom Innis along with Josh Abraham, Lars Stalfors, and Oligee, the album featured the singles \"Loyal Like Sid &amp; Nancy\" and \"Sit Next to Me,\" the latter of which received the remix treatment in 2018 via the Grammy-winning R&amp;B/hip-hop/dance production team the Stereotypes. 2018 also saw the release of the upbeat, one-off single \"Worst Nites,\" followed a year later by another standalone single, \"Style.\" An EP, In the Darkest of Nights, Let the Birds Sing arrived in December 2020. ~ Scott Kerr, Rovi'\n",

Through these songs, I want to remind myself and you to listen to that sometimes-quiet inner voice that can be drowned out by negative thoughts. At their best, I like to think of songs as invisible spiritual chiropractors, they bring us back to our center. They give us little reminders when we least expect it. A lot of my philosophy and inspiration comes from my Mom. She taught me that music is the ladder to our souls. She died when I was 25. Her death broke me into a million pieces. I learned a lot by putting myself back together. After her death, I spent most of my time street performing, often with no one listening. No one wants happy songs from someone who hasn't truly been sad. I've been sad. This past year without any shows has been especially hard on me. I think, like many others, it forced me to reevaluate where I get my self-worth from.

      "\"The music of Cigarettes After Sex invokes not only the powerful feelings of euphoria inherent in the band's name itself, but somehow manages to recreate emotions found only in the most romantic of movies; immersive, achingly nostalgic, thoroughly transporting, and intensely visual. It's these powerful and unique qualities which have enabled the love songs of Cigarettes After Sex to reverberate across countless countries, and excite the most devoted kind of following. After the phenomenal online break-out success of “Nothing's Gonna Hurt You Baby” the singer, guitarist, and creator of Cigarettes After Sex, Greg Gonzalez, wanted to project his worldview onto a bigger screen, a broader canvas. Yet Gonzalez rejected conventional studio routes for his band, which includes Randy Miller on bass and Jacob Tomsky on drums. They recorded their self-titled debut album during a remarkably short, three-day stint at a modest pay-by-the-hour rehearsal space in Brooklyn &amp; their upcoming second album, Cry, over the course of a week on the Spanish island of Mallorca. It's this bottled intensity, and perfect cohesion between musical landscape and lyrics, which keeps listeners thoroughly enraptured, returning to the music again and again; the love songs of Cigarettes After Sex the indelible soundtrack.\"\n",

It was a modest debut (“We thought we'd go back to our jobs,” Bayley says) until the stealthily addictive Gooey became a platinum-certified viral streaming hit. They have since notched up over two billion streams, appeared on James Corden and Jimmy Kimmel, and toured the world to strikingly diverse audiences, from Glastonbury to Primavera and Red Rocks to Coachella. Bayley figured that most bands' second albums are informed by life on the road, for better or worse, so instead of writing about himself, why not tell the stories of some of the fascinating people they met? Each song on 2016's Mercury-shortlisted How to Be a Human Being explore a different character until the overwhelming final track, Agnes, when Bayley turned the camera on himself. Around the same time, Bayley started writing and producing for other artists, including Joey Bada$$, Flume, 6lack, Wale, Khalid and, on last year's Tokyo Drifting, Denzel Curry. Third album Dreamland was recorded in London in 2019, produced by Bayley and mixed by David Wrench, Manny Maroquin and MixedbyAli.

      "'During the heyday of bro-country in the 2010s, Jon Pardi carried the torch for hardcore country. He has never attempted to disguise his debt to traditional country, but he\\'s never attempted to be an Americana singer, either. Pardi is firmly within the mainstream of country music and clever enough to offer sly updates to classic sounds, which is why his 2015 album California Sunrise turned him into a star on the strength of its number one country singles, \"Head Over Boots\" and \"Dirt on My Boots.\" His 2019 follow-up, Heartache Medication, fared nearly as well, and his success spilled into the next decade, continuing with his 2022 album Mr. Saturday Night.Born and raised in Dixon, California, Jon Pardi fell in love with country music when he was a kid, aided by the presence of his grandmother\\'s karaoke machine. He was drawn to hardcore singers from George Jones to George Strait, and he took a shine to singing, performing Garth Brooks\\' \"Friends in Low Places\" at his dad\\'s birthday party when he was merely seven. Pardi picked up a guitar shortly afterward, attempting his first songs when he was 12 and joining a band when he was 14. After graduating from high school, he formed a duo with his friend Chase McGrew. The pair played around their hometown, then headed to Chico, where they attended Butte Junior College while playing in a band called Northern Comfort. Pardi split from McGrew in 2008, moving to Nashville to attempt to break into the country music business. While working as a lifeguard, he hawked his songs, landing a publishing deal 18 months after his arrival. Pardi began placing songs and attracting attention as a performer. Capitol Records Nashville signed Pardi, sending him into the studio with producer Bart Butler. \"Missin\\' You Crazy,\" his first single, appeared in the spring of 2012, but it was the 2013 track \"Up All Night\" that gave him his first country Top Ten. Write You a Song, his full-length debut, appeared in early 2014. It peaked at 14 on Billboard\\'s Top 200 and three on their country albums charts. In September 2015, Pardi released \"Head Over Boots,\" his first single from his second album, California Sunrise. The song climbed to number one on Billboard\\'s Country Airplay chart, helping the record reach number one on Billboard\\'s Country Album chart; it peaked at 11 on the Top 200. Thanks to \"Head Over Boots\" and \"Dirt on My Boots\" -- a second single that bested its predecessor, reaching number one on Country Airplay and crossing over into the pop Top 40 -- California Sunrise turned Pardi into a star. The album stayed on the charts through 2018, spinning off additional hits: \"Heartache on the Dance Floor\" went to three in 2017, \"She Ain\\'t in It\" peaked at 21 that same year, and \"Night Shift\" reached 14 in 2018.Pardi released his third album, Heartache Medication, in September 2019, which spawned the hits \"Ain\\'t Always the Cowboy\" and the chart-topping title cut. The following year saw him issue Rancho Fiesta Sessions, an eight-song collection of cover songs. Pardi\\'s next outing was the 2022 single \"Last Night Lonely,\" the first offering from his fourth album, Mr. Saturday Night, which was released in September of that year. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi'\n",

      "\"Lil Nas X is a 22-year-old award-winning rapper, singer, songwriter from Atlanta, Georgia. Dubbed “an internationally recognized phenomenon” by Billboard, he rose to fame in 2019 when he released “Old Town Road” and simultaneously upended the music industry – shattering genre norms, disrupting the charts and going viral worldwide.

      "\"Anyone can be an artist, but very few can be remarkable. For Giveon —a rising music artist who has a brilliant gift of capturing moods into songs like no other— his biggest fear is being like everyone else. Though he shouldn't be concerned. From his captivating baritone voice to his pensive lyrics and colorful soundscape, Giveon defies not only musical standards, but expectations on how he should be as an artist and a man, as well. “I want them to take away originality and I want to them say ‘ok, this is something different, this is not like what we know,'” he said.Though he always had an affinity for music, Giveon said he fell in love with the art of songwriting before he did with singing. As a child, he would write short stories, just to write, and as he got older, he switched over to poems, because he didn't think anyone would want to read a long story. Eventually that led to rap, but everyone was doing that and Giveon wasn't like the rest. It wasn't until he discovered that his baritone voice wasn't as awkward or ugly as he thought —because after all Frank Sinatra was one— that everything came together for him.\"\n",
